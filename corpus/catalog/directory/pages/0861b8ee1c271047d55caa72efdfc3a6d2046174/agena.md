what_makes_it_special: "Runs on existing Claude Code/Codex CLI subscriptions locally via host bridge (no API keys or per-token billing); full autonomous loop from production error to task to AI fix to PR to merge to issue resolved; Team Skill Catalog with Qdrant vector retrieval that re-applies past solutions; pixel-art 'Boss Mode' office UI for managing AI agents visually; self-hostable multi-tenant SaaS with RBAC; history-grounded sprint refinement; integrates with Sentry, New Relic, Jira, YouTrack, Azure DevOps, GitHub; drag-and-drop visual flow builder with approval gates."

Agena automates the path from production incident to merged fix: errors arriving from Sentry, New Relic, Jira, YouTrack, or Azure DevOps become tasks that a CrewAI/LangGraph pipeline of PM, Planner, Developer, Reviewer, and Finalizer agents turns into reviewed pull requests. Its economic hook is the host bridge — agents run on the team's existing Claude Code or Codex CLI subscriptions locally, so there are no API keys or per-token charges, with OpenAI and Gemini available as alternatives. A Team Skill Catalog in Qdrant retrieves how similar problems were solved before, and integrations cover Jira, YouTrack, and GitHub. It ships as brew/npm CLIs or a self-hosted Docker Compose stack with RBAC and Stripe billing, and a visual flow builder adds approval gates. Teams with steady production-error volume are the intended operators.
