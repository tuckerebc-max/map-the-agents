what_makes_it_special: "Multi-agent workflow orchestration plugin for Claude Code; chain AI agents to automate complex tasks using natural language or declarative .flow syntax. Markdown-based plugin with built-in agents (Explore, Plan, general-purpose), custom agents importable from ~/.claude/agents/, temp agents."
---

The plugin brings data-pipeline ergonomics to agent work: instead of re-prompting Claude Code through each step of a multi-stage task, users describe a workflow in natural language or .flow syntax, and the plugin decomposes it into chained sub-agent invocations with captured outputs feeding later steps. Temp agents handle concrete steps like scraping or database queries; @review checkpoints pause for human input; state snapshots let crashed workflows resume; and .flow.test files allow dry-run unit testing of workflows. Everything runs through the Claude Code plugin system with no separate runtime. Developers automating scraping, reporting, and multi-repo chores install it from the plugin marketplace.
