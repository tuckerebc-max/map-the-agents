what_makes_it_special: "Open-source AI app builder prototype using E2B cloud sandboxes for secure code execution; supports multiple tech stacks (Python, Next.js, Vue, Streamlit, Gradio) and custom LLM personas; add custom LLM providers via JSON config."

Hosted prompt-to-app products keep their generation and execution machinery behind a hosted product, leaving developers who want to study or self-host the pattern without a reference implementation. CodingIT fills that role as an open Apache-2.0 prototype: a Next.js 14 application streams model output into E2B cloud sandboxes where the generated code actually runs, with npm and pip installation available inside the sandbox boundary. Target stacks - Next.js, Vue, Streamlit, Gradio, Python data analysis - are defined as E2B sandbox templates, so adding a stack means writing a Dockerfile rather than modifying application code. Eleven model providers from OpenAI and Anthropic to Groq and Ollama are configured through a single models file. Developers studying the app-builder pattern, or E2B's sandbox model, use it as a starting codebase; the author's newer desktop project, CodinIT.dev, continues the line.
