what_makes_it_special: "Visual GUI workbench with Miller-column (Finder-style) navigation; sessions are editable, branching trees (not linear transcripts); persistent and stateful including paused approval states surviving restarts; everything is an inspectable extension/plugin; multi-client architecture (native desktop app + browser tabs sync to same live session); runs locally, remotely, or both"

Juggler treats an agent session as a manipulable data structure rather than a transcript: sessions branch, backtrack, and edit, with pending approval dialogs persisting across restarts. The Go backend (no Electron) serves a native desktop app and browser clients against the same session, so a phone can watch a run started on a laptop. Every layer is inspectable — system prompts, token counts, what past turns actually sent — and tools, slash commands, and loop strategies ship as JavaScript extensions under Apache-2.0 so closed-source extensions remain possible. Its author is the developer behind JUCE and Tracktion, and the project is a one-person side project now spanning worktrees, SSH, and sandboxing on its roadmap.
