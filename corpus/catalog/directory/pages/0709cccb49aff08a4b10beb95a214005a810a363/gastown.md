what_makes_it_special: "Multi-agent orchestration system that coordinates 20-30+ AI coding agents working on different tasks simultaneously, using git-backed hooks for persistent work state that survives agent crashes and restarts, with built-in merge queue, scheduling, escalation, and federation features."
---

Coordinating dozens of coding agents by hand collapses quickly: sessions die, work is lost, and nobody merges anything. Gastown, from steveyegge and now under gastownhall, organizes a workspace into Rigs staffed by persistent worker agents (Polecats) and a Mayor — typically a Claude Code instance — that decomposes work into convoys tracked in the Beads issue ledger. State is git-backed so crashes and restarts lose nothing, a Refinery merge queue serializes landing, and Witness/Deacon watchdogs plus scheduling and federation (Wasteland via DoltHub) handle the operational surface. It is Go, MIT-licensed, installable via brew or go install, and at 17.8k stars with 7,770 commits it is one of the most active multi-agent orchestrators in the ecosystem.
