---

Flexpilot exists for developers who want Copilot-style assistance inside VS Code without depending on GitHub's service or paying a subscription; it ships as a native extension rather than a webview overlay. Users configure their own providers, with built-in support for Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Groq, Google Gemini, Mistral, Ollama, and many OpenAI-compatible local servers such as vLLM and llama-cpp-python. Features include inline completions, panel/inline/quick chat, voice chat, smart variables that reference editor context, and AI-generated commit messages and PR descriptions. The extension itself is discontinued: no new features will land, and development moved to Flexpilot IDE, a VS Code fork with the extension pre-installed, multi-file editing, and a hosted web IDE.
