what_makes_it_special: "Orbs — remote machines that keep working after you close your laptop; threads resumable from any device (web, terminal, phone); Puck voice control; plugin system inspired by Pi; bring-your-own-subscription 'Dial'; cross-device agent management; top frontier models with smart routing by task."

Amp runs as a web app, terminal CLI/TUI, and iOS/macOS client sharing the same resumable threads: send a prompt, close the laptop, continue from a phone. Orbs host each thread on an isolated remote machine — no worktrees or port conflicts — and can run the app live (Portals), react to events (issue created, CI failed, schedule fired), and admit teammates as multiplayer participants. The CLI supports headless mode for CI and amp sync to mirror orb changes into local checkouts, while plugins extend behavior and ChatGPT subscription linking lets the Dial's effort settings bill your ChatGPT tokens instead of Amp credits. Commercial and closed-source, priced via subscription tiers (a $20/month entry point) with usage-based options; docs live at ampcode.com/manual and development is active as of August 2026.
