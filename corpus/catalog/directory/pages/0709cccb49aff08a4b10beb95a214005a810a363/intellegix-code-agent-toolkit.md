---

The toolkit treats Claude Code as a runtime and layers operational discipline on top. The loop driver keeps sessions continuous, enforces token budgets, detects stagnation, and scales models to task weight, while the multi-agent orchestrator farms work into isolated git worktrees under a guard hook that keeps the orchestrator from editing code directly. The Perplexity council is the distinctive piece: it drives a logged-in Perplexity session through Playwright to consult GPT, Claude, and Gemini at zero marginal cost, then synthesizes with Opus. Thirty-one commands cover planning, implementation, review, and a seven-tier frontend E2E pipeline. It installs by cloning straight into ~/.claude and assumes the operator accepts --dangerously-skip-permissions for autonomous runs.
