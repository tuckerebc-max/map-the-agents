what_makes_it_special: "Isolates CODEX_HOME and Electron user data per named profile without copying, parsing, or migrating tokens; on macOS opens separate named ChatGPT windows with their own local state using the original signed ChatGPT.app (no cloning/patching/re-signing); --share-with shares config selectively without sharing auth or runtime state; workspace binding auto-selects profile per directory; dependency-free single Bash script. Community-maintained, not affiliated with OpenAI."

Codex-profiles solves a workflow problem for people who use Codex across separate contexts — personal, work, client, and test accounts — where mixing conversation history, config, and authentication state causes friction. A wrapper maps each profile name to its own CODEX_HOME directory and, on macOS, to a named ChatGPT Desktop window with isolated Electron user data, using the original signed application binary rather than a clone. The script deliberately never reads, copies, or migrates auth.json, so account separation is at the local-state level rather than a security boundary, and the README states this explicitly. Workspace binding selects a profile automatically per project directory, --share-with shares specific configuration without sharing authentication, and a doctor command verifies the setup. It is distributed as a single dependency-free Bash script via npm, Homebrew, curl, and Nix.
