what_makes_it_special: "A fast, out-of-the-box terminal built for AI coding — a deeply customized fork of WezTerm with practical defaults. 40% smaller binary than WezTerm, instant startup, zero-config defaults, and full WezTerm Lua API compatibility with no migration. Built-in AI assistant with error recovery (Cmd+Shift+E to apply suggested fixes) and natural-language-to-command (# description). AI Tools config manages Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, Kimi Code, and more. macOS-only."

Kaku rebuilds WezTerm's terminal experience for the AI-coding era: a smaller, faster binary (about 40 MB versus 67 MB), instant launch, and defaults that work without Lua configuration — copy on select, clickable file paths, auto dark/light themes, bundled lazygit and Yazi. Its AI layer operates at the shell level: failed commands trigger fix suggestions applicable with Cmd+Shift+E, and typing a # description converts natural language into a command in the prompt. The AI Tools configuration manages third-party CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, Kimi Code) from one place, with chat and AI panels a keystroke away. Existing WezTerm Lua configs carry over unchanged. macOS only, installed via Homebrew or notarized DMG.
