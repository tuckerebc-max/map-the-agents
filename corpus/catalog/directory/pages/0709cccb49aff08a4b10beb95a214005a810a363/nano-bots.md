what_makes_it_special: "Repository for Nano Bots' Cartridges — small AI-powered bots shareable as a single YAML file, supporting multiple LLM providers and tool/function calling. Implementations exist for Sublime Text and VS Code, plus a CLI, API, and Clinic live editor. Recommends CC0-1.0 for individual cartridges."

Nano Bots defines bots as single YAML cartridge files that anyone can download, copy, or author and run through any conforming implementation. The specification covers adapters, provider configuration, tool/function calling, and a marketplace metadata section with tags and honestly auto-generated sample outputs. A profile.yml convention organizes community cartridges under author namespaces on nbots.io. Because prompts' intellectual property status is unsettled, the project recommends authors license individual cartridges under SPDX terms such as CC0-1.0. The repo itself has only nine commits, and the cartridge collection has not changed since mid-2023.
