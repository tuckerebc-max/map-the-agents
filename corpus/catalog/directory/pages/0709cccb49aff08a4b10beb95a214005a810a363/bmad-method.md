what_makes_it_special: "An agile methodology framework for AI-driven development covering the entire delivery lifecycle -- from clarifying vague ideas to planning, building, verifying, and learning -- preserving durable context across sessions with specialized agent perspectives."

BMAD-METHOD addresses the failure mode where AI coding tools lose context between chats, forget decisions, and produce code that drifts from requirements. It installs a structured set of agent personas — product, architecture, UX, development, testing — into whatever AI tool a team already uses, with workflows that scale process to the change: trivial fixes go straight to build, larger efforts pass through explicit planning phases with durable artifacts that carry decisions forward across sessions. Installed into a project, it adds agent definitions and commands (bmad-build, bmad-help) that the host tool invokes; modules extend the base with dedicated test-architect, loop-based unattended builds, and game-dev studios. Its audience spans solo developers through teams running greenfield or legacy work, and its 50k+ stars make it one of the most widely adopted agent frameworks. Development is active, on a V6 line, with docs at docs.bmad-method.org and a no-paywall community.
