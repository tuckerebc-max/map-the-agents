MAGE brings the agentic generate-and-verify pattern to hardware description, where correctness is checked by simulation rather than unit tests. Orchestration code drives LLM agents (demonstrated with Claude and GPT-4o) through configurable runs against NVIDIA's verilog-eval benchmark, selecting instances by regex and scoring candidates through iverilog simulation, Verilator linting, and Pyverilog parsing, with optional golden testbenches. A companion notebook generates testbenches for new problems. The project accompanies a DAC-track paper and serves hardware-design researchers evaluating LLM code generation for Verilog; it is a research artifact with academic-repo-level activity rather than a production tool.
