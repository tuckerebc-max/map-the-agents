what_makes_it_special: "Emacs frontend for the Pi coding agent that communicates over RPC for structured messages and tool events (instead of terminal text). Provides a Markdown-rendered chat buffer with tree-sitter highlighting, a separate editable prompt buffer, session management, fork/compact, and Evil integration — letting you use familiar Emacs editing habits for composing prompts."
---

pi-coding-agent brings pi into Emacs on RPC rather than terminal emulation, so the package receives structured messages and tool events instead of scraping ANSI output — the difference between a real client and a screen-scraping wrapper. The chat buffer renders Markdown with tree-sitter highlighting, a separate prompt buffer keeps drafts editable between turns, and sessions support fork and compact operations from Emacs. Activity-phase hooks fire as sessions move between thinking, replying, running, compacting, and idle states, letting Elisp tint inputs, send notifications, or track busy sessions; Evil integration keeps modal editing intact for Vim users. Distributed on MELPA under GPL-3.0-or-later and tested in CI across Emacs 29 and 30 plus nightly builds, it targets Emacs users who want agentic coding without leaving their editor's conventions.
