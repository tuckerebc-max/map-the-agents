what_makes_it_special: "Separates planning (human-in-the-loop) from execution (fully autonomous parallel TDD workers); auto-detects task dependencies for parallel execution; pure TDD (requirements map directly to test names); convention-over-configuration pipeline with agents self-enrolling via frontmatter."

hcf (Halt and Catch Fire) is a Claude Code plugin that imposes a two-phase discipline on agent-driven development. During planning, a plan-create skill explores the codebase, asks clarifying questions, and decomposes the work into task files with explicit dependencies, where each requirement is written directly as a test name in strict red-green-refactor style. Execution then runs through plan-orchestrate, which reads the dependency graph and runs tasks in parallel batches rather than sequentially, with each task required to pass tests before completion; failures retry three times before being blocked while others continue. A pipeline of eight hook points lets agents enroll by declaring a phase in their frontmatter, with built-in plan-review and code-standards enforcement available. State persists in plan files so interrupted runs resume cleanly, and the plugin never pushes or opens PRs without permission.
