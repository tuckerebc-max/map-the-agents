what_makes_it_special: "Runs AI coding agents in a locked-down local sandbox with minimal filesystem access, configurable network egress via sidecar proxy (mitmproxy), proxy-side secret injection where the agent container never sees API keys/tokens, iptables firewall preventing direct outbound bypass, hot-reloadable policies, and seamless agent switching with preserved state/credentials."
---

Giving a coding agent your real machine hands it your credentials and your whole filesystem, which is why many teams refuse to run them locally; agent-sandbox wraps agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Copilot, and others) in a Debian-based container that mounts only the repo directory. A mitmproxy sidecar enforces fine-grained network policy — allowed hosts with scheme, method, path, and query rules, plus repo-scoped git access with proxy-side credential injection — while iptables blocks any outbound traffic that tries to skip the proxy. Agent state persists across runs in volumes, policies hot-reload, and VS Code or JetBrains devcontainers can attach to the sandbox. Security-conscious developers on Apple Silicon (Colima + Docker) running semi-trusted agents are the users.
