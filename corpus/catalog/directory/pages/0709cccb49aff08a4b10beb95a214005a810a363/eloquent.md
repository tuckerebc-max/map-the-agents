what_makes_it_special: "Local AI workstation combining LLM chat/roleplay, in-house Stable Diffusion image generation, voice cloning, research-grade model ELO testing, forensic linguistics, and a tool-calling code editor into a single application running entirely locally without subscriptions. Features working multi-GPU inference, multi-role chat with story state tracking, voice cloning with paralinguistic cues, and a built-in model ELO testing framework."
---

Eloquent consolidates the local-AI stack that users otherwise assemble from half a dozen separate tools, motivated by the position that chat, image generation, voice, and coding should share one local runtime with no subscriptions and no third-party data flow. The code editor embeds a tool-calling agent with seven tools covering file operations, automatic .bak backups, and optionally sandboxed shell execution, with chain-of-thought visualization, hallucination rescue, and loop detection to keep long runs usable on local models. The rest of the app serves the same single-machine philosophy: local Stable Diffusion (SD 1.5, SDXL, FLUX) with optional cloud fallback, voice cloning, an ELO-testing framework for comparing models, and forensic linguistics tools. It targets Windows users with NVIDIA GPUs who want experimentation without cloud dependencies or subscriptions.
