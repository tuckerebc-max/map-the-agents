what_makes_it_special: "Sandboxed per-employee agent platform where credentials never reach the model: a Rust gateway performs MITM HTTPS to inject scoped secrets per request, backed by an AES-256-GCM secret store or on-demand Bitwarden/1Password, with policy enforced at the network level and deterministic human-in-the-loop approvals for sensitive actions. The runner is outbound-only, working on laptops, homelabs, or NAT'd VPCs."

OneCLI is an open-source, YC-backed agent platform that gives every employee a personal AI agent in a sealed sandbox, originally built as a Rust credential vault for AI agents and repivoted to team-based agent management after demand from users running autonomous agents like Hermes and OpenClaw. Agents chat via a dashboard or per-agent Slack apps and work on real tasks — triaging tickets, reconciling Stripe charges, opening PRs, revoking access — while all outbound traffic is routed through the gateway, which injects credentials on the fly so the model never sees real secrets, blocks forbidden actions, rate-limits runaway agents, and pauses sensitive actions for approval cards. The stack is a Next.js dashboard, API control plane, Rust gateway, sandbox supervisor with a vendor-neutral harness interface, and an outbound-only runner that needs no inbound ports; it is self-hostable or available as a cloud product. Free tier includes $5 in AI credits and 500 calls per month, with paid tiers beyond.
