what_makes_it_special: "Story Creation AI Agent system for novels, scripts, interactive film/games, and translation. Unified pi-agent harness integrating chat agents, deterministic pipelines, and structured tool execution. 37-dimension continuity auditing with built-in anti-AI-detection writing. Structured state management with Zod schema validation, SQLite FTS5/BM25 retrieval, atomic file commits. Interactive open-world play mode. Multi-line plot branching without modifying canon. Style fingerprint cloning. Per-agent model routing. 15 built-in SKILL.md skills. KIMI Open Source partner (sponsored by Moonshot AI)."

InkOS applies agent-harness mechanics to long-form fiction, where continuity across hundreds of chapters is the core problem. Each chapter runs a plan, compose, write, audit, revise pipeline over a three-layer memory (JSON state, Markdown projections, SQLite time-series), with 37 continuity checks and deliberate 'de-AI-flavor' rewriting. Beyond novels, it ships one-shot short stories, an interactive open-world play mode with world contracts, style imitation via analyze/import, and EPUB export. Fifteen SKILL.md skills are built in, and per-agent model routing lets the Writer run on one provider while the Auditor uses another. Writers, web-fiction studios, and interactive-fiction developers use its Studio web UI, TUI, or daemon mode with Telegram and Feishu notifications.
