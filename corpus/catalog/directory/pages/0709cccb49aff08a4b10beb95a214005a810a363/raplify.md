what_makes_it_special: "GUI for AI coding agents with four tool windows"
---

Raplify embeds an AI coding-agent workspace directly into JetBrains IDEs, built around the observation that agents are most useful when the developer can see the same code structures the agent is reasoning about. Its four tool windows cover an agent chat panel, every REST endpoint discovered in the source grouped and searchable by path, the Java call flow resolved from the project's real index rather than guessed from names, and a database schema browser with entity-relationship layout. The chat panel passes the current editor selection as context, offers model and permission-mode selectors, and renders tool cards and project commands inline. Because it depends on Node.js and an installed Claude CLI, the agent runtime stays external and versionable while Raplify supplies the visual surface. Backend and full-stack developers use it to keep endpoint maps, call paths, and schema visible while directing an agent without leaving the IDE.
