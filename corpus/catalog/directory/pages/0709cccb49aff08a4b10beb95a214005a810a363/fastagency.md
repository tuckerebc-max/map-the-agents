what_makes_it_special: "Unified programming interface for deploying AG2 (AutoGen) multi-agent workflows to production; seamless OpenAPI integration with few lines of code; Tester class for CI; CLI for orchestration; multiple UI options (Console, Mesop web) and network adapters (FastAPI REST, NATS via FastStream)"
---

FastAgency was built because multi-agent workflows that work in a notebook rarely survive contact with production: it provides one programming interface over AG2 workflows with pluggable UIs (console, Mesop web chat) and serving options (REST API, NATS-based distributed deployment). OpenAPI integration lets agents call existing REST services with minimal glue code, a Tester class runs workflows inside CI, and Cookiecutter scaffolding generates a complete project with devcontainer and deployment scripts for Docker and Fly.io behind GitHub Actions. Maintained by the ag2ai organization alongside AG2 itself, it targets Python teams moving multi-agent systems from prototypes to operated services rather than individual developers picking a coding assistant.
