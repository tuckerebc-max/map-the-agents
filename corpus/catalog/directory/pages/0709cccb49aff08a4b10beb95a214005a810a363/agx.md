what_makes_it_special: "Local workspace for running AI coding agents across tickets, repos, and PRs. Runs a ticket -> implementation -> PR -> review loop with human-in-the-loop gates at every step. Fully local execution (code never leaves your machine), checkpointed state that survives restarts with constant-cost resumption, unified workspace where tickets/code/PRs/reviews live in one window, and provider-agnostic switching (Claude <-> Codex <-> Gemini <-> Ollama) mid-thread. Integrates with Jira/Linear. Available as local web dashboard, CLI, and macOS desktop app."

Running coding agents ad hoc means state lives in terminal scrollback and review discipline depends on memory. AGX gives every ticket a durable home — objectives, scheduled jobs, chat threads, and terminal sessions under a project, with SQLite (WAL) state that survives restarts — and connects it to Jira or Linear intake. Agents draft implementations in worktree isolation, a reviewer agent does first-pass PR review so humans judge only contested changes, and nothing irreversible proceeds without an explicit approve/reject gate. Agents can be switched mid-thread between Claude, Codex, Gemini, and Ollama, and role-grouped teams route work by tag. The tool ships as a CLI, a Next.js dashboard, and an Electron macOS app, and its own repository documents 167+ merged PRs authored by the agents it manages.
