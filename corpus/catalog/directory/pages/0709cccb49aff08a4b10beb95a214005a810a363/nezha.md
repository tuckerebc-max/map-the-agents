what_makes_it_special: "A lightweight (~7MB) cross-platform IDE designed for the AI agents era that manages multiple Claude Code/Codex sessions across projects simultaneously, with visual session replay, native Git Worktree support, built-in code editor, Skill management via symlinks, and notifications when agents need human intervention."
---

nezha addresses the workflow gap that appears when AI writes most of the code and development becomes parallel: traditional IDEs assume a human writing one file at a time. It embeds Claude Code and Codex terminals natively, tracks sessions across projects in a sidebar, and renders finished sessions visually so they can be reviewed without terminal resume commands. Built-in git support covers branch creation, worktree-based development, AI-generated commit messages, and a code review view, while notifications flag when an agent needs human input. Light code and Markdown editors are included for review-level edits without launching a full IDE. The GPL-3.0 project is written in TypeScript with Tauri and xterm.js.
