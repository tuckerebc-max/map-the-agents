what_makes_it_special: "Claude Multi-Agent iterative sub-agent orchestration system using Claude Code custom commands. Wave-based agent deployment, parallel task distribution with concept deduplication, and progressive context summarization to achieve infinite-scale task execution within context constraints."
---

The project demonstrates a pattern for pushing Claude Code past single-context limits: work is divided into waves, each wave spawns fresh sub-agents with clean context windows, and the orchestrator keeps only lightweight state while progressive summarization carries conclusions forward. Each sub-agent receives a unique direction to avoid duplicated output, and the system plans graceful conclusions as capacity is approached. The commands ship as markdown files dropped into .claude/commands/, with no code or runtime beyond Claude Code itself. It is a two-commit proof-of-concept used by prompt-engineering practitioners exploring large parallel generation, not a maintained product.
