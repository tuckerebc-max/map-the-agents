what_makes_it_special: "Local-first, evidence-first AI coding terminal with an anti-hallucination system enforcing evidence-first engineering (reading facts, verifying, distinguishing verification scopes, refusing unverified claims, and expressing uncertainty as runtime constraints); Chinese and Windows are first-class citizens"
---

Linghun's premise is that hallucinated success is the worst failure mode of coding agents, so it enforces evidence as a runtime constraint rather than a prompt instruction: answers are classified PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL against what was actually read and verified, and the final-answer gate refuses unverified claims. The harness adds workspace snapshots, git stable points and worktrees, controlled memory with failure learning, multi-model role routing, and an App Bridge capability runtime for connecting external applications via manifests and local HTTP connectors. Windows, PowerShell, and Chinese paths are first-class, reflecting its user base. It ships as an npm-distributed Apache-2.0 CLI with a published whitepaper in Chinese and English.
