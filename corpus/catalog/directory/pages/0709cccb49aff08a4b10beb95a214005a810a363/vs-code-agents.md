what_makes_it_special: "Multi-agent workflow system for GitHub Copilot in VS Code bringing structure, quality gates, and long-term memory to AI-assisted development. Specialized agents (Planner, Implementer, Security, QA, etc.) each own a specific part of the dev workflow with clear constraints and document-driven output; designed for persistent, workspace-scoped memory via Flowbaby."
---

vs-code-agents exists because unstructured Copilot sessions forget context, skip quality gates, and lose decision history. It defines 13 custom agents (planner, analyst, architect, security, critic, implementer, code-reviewer, QA, UAT, devops, roadmap, retrospective, process-improvement) as Markdown files installed into a project's .github/agents/ directory, each with hard constraints: the Planner cannot write code and the Implementer cannot redesign. Agents hand off through structured Markdown documents stored in an agent-output/ audit trail, and the Security agent follows a five-phase framework covering STRIDE threat modeling, OWASP Top 10, CVE scanning, and ASVS compliance. Cross-session memory requires the companion Flowbaby VS Code extension backed by Python 3.10+. It targets teams standardizing Copilot-assisted development with review gates.
