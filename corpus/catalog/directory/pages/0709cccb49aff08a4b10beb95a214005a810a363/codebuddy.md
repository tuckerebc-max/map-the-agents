Codebuddy embeds an autonomous software engineer into VS Code, built on the LangGraph DeepAgents framework: a Developer Agent coordinates seven specialized subagents (analyzer, architect, debugger, reviewer, tester, doc writer, file organizer) while planning, editing, running terminal commands, and self-correcting until tasks complete. It supports ten model providers with automatic failover and cooldowns, MCP integration through Docker's MCP Gateway or direct SSE/stdio servers, and hybrid memory combining vector search with SQLite FTS4 and MMR reranking. Enterprise-oriented controls include a credential proxy, permission profiles, doctor diagnostics, OpenTelemetry tracing, and cost tracking across 25+ models, alongside 20+ built-in tools, 16 bundled skills, and 17 service connectors. The public repository was archived on August 28, 2026 and development continues in a private repository.
