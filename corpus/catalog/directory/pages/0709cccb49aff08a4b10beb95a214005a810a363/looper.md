what_makes_it_special: "Loop-based agents with success criteria (not fixed steps); forge is source of truth (no external tracker/YAML); parallel-safe git worktrees; local/inspectable/stoppable daemon; multi-repo support; bring-your-own-agent with no vendor lock-in"
---

Looper automates the issue-to-merge pipeline for maintainers who cannot babysit every ticket: register a repo, and the looperd daemon polls the forge for assigned or looper-labeled issues, then runs a planner (until the spec is reviewable), a worker (implements the spec when checks pass), and a reviewer-fixer pair that ping-pongs until no actionable threads remain, all gated by a label state machine. A takeover mode drives a single PR through review-and-fix cycles to merge, and a multi-node loopernet mode distributes webhook-driven work. The vendor layer is pluggable - opencode, claude-code, codex, cursor-cli, grok-build, pi, omp - so teams keep their existing agent subscriptions, and everything runs locally as two Go binaries with no hosted control plane. Open-source maintainers drowning in labeled issues are the target user.
