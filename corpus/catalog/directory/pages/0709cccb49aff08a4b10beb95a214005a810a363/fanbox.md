what_makes_it_special: "Local-first, zero-config, zero-runtime-dependency desktop cockpit for coding agents that unifies the entire vibe-coding loop (find files, preview, light edit, command agent, see what changed) into a single window. No cloud, no accounts, no remote — data never leaves your machine. Live dashboard where file cards ripple/glow as the agent writes them, follow mode, session replay timeline, 5 independent reviewer subagents that must score >=90, and three distinct themed skins."

FanBox came out of indie developer Huashu's observation that agents now create projects faster than humans can track them — ten projects in an afternoon, and no way to see what changed where. The Electron app bundles a fuzzy-searching file browser with previews (Markdown, live HTML, code, images, video, PDF, archives), a real embedded terminal (node-pty + xterm.js), and a dashboard where agent file-writes light up cards in real time, with a cross-project inbox collecting changes across every running agent. Eleven built-in agent launchers cover Claude Code, Codex, Hermes Agent, OpenClaw, Kimi Code, opencode, pi, and other CLIs, extensible through ~/.fanbox/config.json. It targets individual developers juggling several concurrent agent sessions who need orientation and review rather than another agent.
