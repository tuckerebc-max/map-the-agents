what_makes_it_special: "Development toolkit for AI-assisted coding with a 6-stage pipeline (intake, apply, review, hydrate, ship, review-PR) using plain markdown prompts — no SDK, no vendor lock-in. Structured thinking-first pipeline: forces intake/plan before code. Assembly-line parallelism via self-contained change folders + git worktree isolation. Shared project memory in docs/memory/ committed to git. SRAD autonomy framework: 4-dimension confidence scoring decides when AI should assume vs. ask. Project constitution (constitution.md) enforces MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT architectural rules. Self-correcting review loop with sub-agent review (up to 3 cycles)."

fab-kit came out of the observation that AI-assisted development lacked a repeatable process: each session improvised, and quality depended on the prompt of the day. It installs a structured pipeline as markdown prompts that a host agent executes in order — intake captures requirements, apply implements, review checks, hydrate refreshes context, ship lands the change, and review-PR closes the loop — with a `fab` CLI (written in Go) routing between stages and companion tools `wt` for git worktree management and `idea` for capturing backlogs. Because the pipeline is files and slash commands rather than an SDK, it runs identically across Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Windsurf, and parallel agent sessions stay coordinated through worktrees. Solo developers and small teams using multiple agent harnesses are the intended audience; it is part of the shll.ai toolkit.
