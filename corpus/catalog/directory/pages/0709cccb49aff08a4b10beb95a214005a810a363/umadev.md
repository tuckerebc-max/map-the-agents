what_makes_it_special: "Orchestrates a 9-seat dev team (8 specialist roles + coordinator) over borrowed AI brains — driving one of 5 existing AI coding CLIs rather than owning any model endpoint. Deterministic acceptance floor (build/test/contract verification runs regardless of model self-assessment). 113 governance checks with fail-open design. Delivery evidence with proof packs, scorecards, compliance mappings (SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / EU AI Act). Spec-driven with 34 normative clauses. Local-first retrieval with BM25 + optional local vector embeddings. Frontend↔backend contract verification."

UmaDev exists because a raw coding CLI has no delivery discipline: it declares completion without evidence, and teams adopting it for real work need governance, plans, and proof. The tool drives one of five installed coding CLIs as its brain — the CLI keeps its own login and model config — while umadev supplies the process: clarify, research, PRD/architecture/UI-UX documents, staged gates, and delivery artifacts including a proof pack and compliance mapping. Roles coordinate through shared blackboard artifact files rather than chat; reviewer roles run as fresh read-only child sessions whose verdicts feed a coordinator; and quality gates run builds, tests, and OpenAPI contract checks regardless of what the model claims. Trust tiers (plan/guarded/auto) set autonomy per task, irreversible actions always confirm, and hooks wire governance into Claude Code and git pre-commit; an MCP server exposes the governor to other clients. Teams needing auditable, compliance-mapped AI development use it; it is a single MIT-licensed Rust binary distributed via npm or native installer.
