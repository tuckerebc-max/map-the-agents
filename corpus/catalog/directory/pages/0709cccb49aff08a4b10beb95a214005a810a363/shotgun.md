what_makes_it_special: "Spec-driven development CLI/TUI that reads your entire codebase (tree-sitter indexing), plans features upfront, and splits them into staged PRs with file-by-file instructions for AI coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex). Multi-phase structured workflow (Research, Specify, Plan, Tasks, Export) with dedicated sub-agents per phase managed by a Router. Starts with research to discover existing solutions/patterns before writing specs, preventing duplicate work. Exports tool-agnostic AGENTS.md files. Two execution modes: Planning (default, with checkpoints) and Drafting (runs full plan). BYOK or Shotgun credits. Install via uvx/uv."

Large features derail coding agents because context arrives piecemeal; Shotgun front-loads the work by reading the entire repository, researching before specifying, and producing a full plan split into staged pull requests with file-by-file instructions. Internally a Router dispatches specialized sub-agents through Research, Specify, Plan, Tasks, and Export phases, and the user controls exactly two execution modes — planning with checkpoints, or drafting end-to-end. The index lives in ~/.shotgun-sh, telemetry is minimal and anonymous, and BYOK covers OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini or prepaid Shotgun credits. It installs via uvx as a Python TUI/CLI, integrates Context7 experimentally for current library docs, and targets teams handing substantial features to Cursor, Codex, or Claude Code who need the plan to survive the handoff.
