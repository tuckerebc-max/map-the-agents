## Why TokenTelemetry?

AI coding agents like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex are powerful — but they burn through tokens fast. **How many tokens did that refactor cost? Which agent is most efficient? What did it actually do?**

TokenTelemetry answers all of that — locally, instantly, for free.

| Problem                                                | TokenTelemetry Solution                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| "How much did that Claude Code session cost?"          | Real-time cost tracking per session/project |
| "What tools did my agent call?"                        | Full waterfall trace of every tool call     |
| "Which model is most token-efficient for my codebase?" | Per-model analytics & comparisons           |
| "Did my agent follow its plan?"                        | Plan-mode capture & display                 |
| "I use 3 different agents — unified view?"             | Multi-agent dashboard in one place          |

## Hermes Agent: autonomous observability

Hermes Agent isn't a coding agent — it runs across CLI, messaging platforms (Telegram, Discord, Slack, Feishu, …), scheduled jobs, and webhooks. It gets its own surface at **`/hermes`** with:

- **38 source platforms** — every value Hermes emits in `sessions.source`
- **Per-API-call latency + cache hit %** parsed from `agent.log`
- **Inline `delegate_task` subagent cards** with summary, tokens, duration
- **Skills + memory pages**, **cron health**, **gateway health**, **cost anomaly detection**
- **Provider-aware pricing** — same model priced correctly across direct / OpenRouter / Together / Fireworks

Run TokenTelemetry on the same host as Hermes — we read `$HERMES_HOME` (or `~/.hermes/` if unset) locally, no remote-DB mode yet.

### Hermes Dashboard plugin (`:9119` → `:3000`)

If you run Hermes's own web dashboard (`hermes dashboard`, port `9119`), install the plugin so TokenTelemetry shows up as a tab inside it — one port to remember, deep-link cards to every TT page.

**Standalone install** (recommended — uses Hermes's own plugin manager):

```bash
hermes plugins install VasiHemanth/tokentelemetry-hermes-plugin
hermes dashboard
```

**From this repo** (canonical source, useful if you're hacking on the plugin):

```bash
./scripts/install-hermes-plugin.sh
hermes dashboard
```

The launcher tab works for every TT page, not just `/hermes` — Analytics, Projects, and All Agents views all open from inside Hermes Dashboard. Pure-frontend, no extra backend, no network access beyond your local TT. See [`plugin/hermes-dashboard/README.md`](plugin/hermes-dashboard/README.md) for details.

## What You'll See

### Dashboard

Connected agents, recent activity feed, model distribution pie chart, token burn rate.

📖 [Docs: Dashboard](https://tokentelemetry.com/docs/features/dashboard)

### Projects View

Per-project heatmap, tool usage breakdown, agent leaderboard, session timeline. Activity split across git worktrees rolls up under its parent repo.

📖 [Docs: Projects](https://tokentelemetry.com/docs/features/projects)

### Budgets & Alerts

Set a spend or token limit on any project — monthly, weekly, or rolling 30-day, overall and per agent. Budgets are **observational**: TokenTelemetry tracks this period's spend against your limit but never blocks an agent. Set one on the project's **Config** tab (dollars or tokens, a period, and alert thresholds — 80% and 100% by default). The project header and **Insights** tab show how close you are, colour-coded as spend climbs, and when spend crosses a threshold an alert lands in the notification center — the bell at the bottom of the sidebar.

📖 [Docs: Budgets & Alerts](https://tokentelemetry.com/docs/features/budgets)

### Plan Limits

How much of each coding agent's plan you have actually spent, read from the login already on your machine — the 5-hour session window, the weekly window, credits, and when each resets. The numbers come from the provider, so they match Claude's or Codex's own usage screen rather than being estimated from your history.

The gauge at the bottom of the sidebar is tinted by whichever window across all your agents is closest to its ceiling; hover it for every window on every signed-in agent, or click to pin it open. Each agent's page and dashboard tile carry the same reading. Agents with no live number say which kind of gap it is — not signed in, a session that needs a fresh login, an account with no plan quota, or a provider with no quota API at all. Nothing is ever estimated.

Distinct from **Budgets**: plan limits are your provider's ceiling on your account, budgets are your own ceiling on a project.

📖 [Docs: Plan limits](https://tokentelemetry.com/docs/features/plan-limits)

### Session Trace

Full waterfall: system prompt → reasoning → tool calls → responses → final output. See exactly what your agent was thinking.

📖 [Docs: Session traces](https://tokentelemetry.com/docs/features/traces)

### Analytics

Cumulative token & cost graphs per agent/model over time. Compare efficiency across models.

📖 [Docs: Analytics](https://tokentelemetry.com/docs/features/analytics)

### Plans

Captured plan-mode outputs from Claude Code's `/plan` command and equivalent in other agents.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js 20.9+**
- **Python 3.9+**
- **git**
- Any supported AI coding agent already installed (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, etc.)

---

## Configuration

TokenTelemetry stores lightweight state in `~/.tokentelemetry/`:

```
~/.tokentelemetry/
  aliases.json       # Rename/merge project folder paths
  hidden.json        # Hide specific projects from dashboard
  preferences.json   # App preferences (e.g. update check on/off)
  billing.json       # Per-agent billing-mode overrides
  power.json         # Local-model power & electricity settings
  VERSION            # Current version
```

All hand-editable JSON — no database, no config GUI needed.

### Choosing where data is stored

Prefer to keep your system drive clear, or isolate dev-tool state on a secondary
drive? Point TokenTelemetry's data directory anywhere:

- **Launcher flag** — `start.sh --data-dir /mnt/d/tt-data` (or `-d`). The folder
  is created on first write.
- **Environment** — set `TOKENTELEMETRY_DATA_DIR=/mnt/d/tt-data` before
  launching. Used verbatim — that exact folder becomes the store (no
  `.tokentelemetry` suffix appended). An explicit `--data-dir` flag wins over it.

> **Windows cmd.exe tip:** If using quotes around the path, avoid a trailing backslash (e.g. `--data-dir "D:\tt\"`) as `\"` escapes the quote in `cmd.exe`. Use forward slashes or omit the trailing slash instead.

Everything — aliases, hidden projects, preferences, billing/power overrides,
summaries cache, the update-check stamp — moves together, so a single setting
relocates *all* state. The default remains `~/.tokentelemetry/`.

### Privacy & outbound calls

Your AI-usage data — logs, sessions, tokens, costs, prompts, file paths, and
project names — **never leaves your machine**. TokenTelemetry makes two
optional outbound calls:

1. **Update check** — about once an hour the dashboard fetches the latest
   version and curated release notes from GitHub so you know when new features
   land. Only a version request; your IP and app name reach GitHub like any
   web request.

2. **Anonymous product-usage telemetry** (on by default, one-click off) —
   content-free usage signals sent to a Cloudflare Worker: which pages you
   open, which features you use, summary success/engine, OS + CPU arch + app
   version, approximate country (derived at Cloudflare's edge — never your
   IP), which AI agents are detected (generic names), whether each detected agent's sessions could be read at all (a size band, never a count), and a random per-launch
   session id that is not linked across launches. It never collects your code,
   prompts, model output, file/directory paths, project names, token counts,
   costs, IP address, or any stable user or device identifier. Full details:
   [tokentelemetry.com/privacy](https://tokentelemetry.com/privacy) and
   Settings → *Usage & privacy* in the app.

**Turning off telemetry:**

- **In the app** — Settings → *Usage & privacy* → toggle off.
- **Via environment** — `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` or `TT_NO_TELEMETRY=1` (hard off;
  useful for enterprise or egress-restricted environments). Auto-disabled in
  CI / non-interactive sessions.

**Turning off the update check:**

- **In the app** — Settings → *Updates & privacy* → toggle off *Check for updates*.
- **Via environment** — `TT_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` (wins over the in-app toggle).

---

## Remote Access

TokenTelemetry is **local-first** and binds to `127.0.0.1` by default so that your agent logs, prompts, and costs never leave the machine. Remote access is an opt-in feature with clear security boundaries (loopback is always exempt; non-loopback requests require a token).

### Direct remote / tailnet / LAN access

Use the built-in flags when you can reach the machine directly (tailnet, LAN, or a VPS with ports open):

```bash
./start.sh --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --allowed-origins your-laptop.tailnet.ts.net,192.168.1.42 \
  --port 3000 --api-port 8000
```

- `--host 0.0.0.0` (or a concrete IP) makes the backend listen on all interfaces.
- `--allowed-origins` configures CORS on the backend and allowed dev origins for Next.js.
- On a non-loopback `--host`, a random token is **auto-generated and printed once** (unless you pass `--auth-token` or `--insecure-no-auth`).
- The launcher prints a connect URL (`http://.../?token=...`) and the dashboard shows a "Connect a device" panel with a QR code.
- Your own browser on the server machine (loopback) never needs the token. Remote clients send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (or `?token=...` for images and artifacts).

**Security note:** Only use `--insecure-no-auth` on a fully trusted private network. See the warning printed by the launcher and run `./start.sh --help` for the full flag reference and examples.

When you load the dashboard from the remote address (e.g. the Network URL printed by Next.js), the frontend automatically derives the backend URL from `window.location` + the API port, so everything just works.

### SSH tunnel access (VPS / "only SSH exposed" / no port changes)

This pattern is common when your agents (and their logs) run on a remote VPS or server and you only have SSH access, or you prefer to keep the dashboard bound to localhost on the remote side.

**On the remote machine** (where the agent logs live — this is required because TokenTelemetry reads files locally):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000 ./start.sh
```

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` override tells the frontend to always talk to the backend at that address (instead of deriving it from the browser's window.location). It is inherited by the Next.js dev server.

**On your laptop:**

```bash
ssh -N -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 user@remote-host
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** on your laptop.

Both the UI and all data fetches are forwarded over the single SSH connection. The old single-port example (`-L 3000:...` only) produced a page skeleton with no data because the frontend would try to reach the backend on the laptop's localhost instead of the remote.

This method requires no firewall changes on the remote machine and reuses your existing SSH authentication.

## FAQ

**Q: Does TokenTelemetry send any data to the cloud?**  
A: Your AI-usage data — logs, sessions, tokens, costs, prompts — never leaves your machine. There are two optional outbound calls: (1) an **update check** that fetches the latest version from GitHub (no usage data), and (2) **anonymous product-usage telemetry** (on by default) that sends content-free signals — pages visited, features used, OS/arch/version, approximate country, detected agent names — but never your code, prompts, costs, paths, or any stable identifier. Turn off telemetry in Settings → *Usage & privacy* or set `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` / `TT_NO_TELEMETRY=1`. Turn off the update check in Settings → *Updates & privacy* or set `TT_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`. See [Privacy & outbound calls](#privacy--outbound-calls).

**Q: How does it track Claude Code token usage?**  
A: Claude Code writes JSONL session logs to `~/.claude/`. TokenTelemetry watches those files and parses token counts, tool calls, and reasoning in real time.

**Q: Does it work with multiple agents at the same time?**  
A: Yes. It detects all supported agents and shows them in a unified dashboard. You can filter by agent, model, or project.

**Q: Is there a cost to use TokenTelemetry?**  
A: No. It is free and open-source under the MIT license.

**Q: How is TokenTelemetry different from Langfuse, LangSmith, or Helicone?**  
A: Those tools require you to instrument your code, create an account, and send data to their cloud. TokenTelemetry is 100% local, zero-config, and works by reading the log files your agents already write — no SDK, no API key, no cloud.

**Q: Can I monitor Gemini CLI token usage?**  
A: Yes. TokenTelemetry supports Gemini CLI and shows token counts, costs, and session traces for Google's Gemini models (Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, etc.).

**Q: Does it support Cursor or GitHub Copilot?**  
A: Yes. Cursor and GitHub Copilot sessions are detected and tracked.

### Hermes Agent FAQ

**Q: Is there any other observability tool for Hermes Agent?**  
A: Not really. Hermes ships its own `/usage` + `/insights` and a bundled Langfuse plugin, but no third-party tool treats it as a first-class agent with a dedicated dashboard. Tracking: [`NousResearch/hermes-agent#6642`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/6642).

**Q: Will it work for my Hermes bot on a VPS?**  
A: Yes — run TokenTelemetry on the same host (it reads local files). See the **[Remote Access](#remote-access)** section above for the two supported methods:

- Direct exposure with `--host 0.0.0.0` + token (recommended when the network allows it).
- SSH tunnel with the correct dual-port forward (`-L 3000:... -L 8000:...`) plus `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` on the remote (the previously documented single-port command produced a blank dashboard).

**Q: Is "Hermes Agent" the same as the Hermes-3 LLMs?**  
A: No. Hermes Agent is the [open-source agent framework](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent); Hermes-3 is a family of fine-tuned models. TokenTelemetry observes the agent — it can be running any model.

## Use Cases

- **Hermes Agent operators** running a Telegram / Discord / cron bot on a VPS — see costs per platform, gateway health, cron-run history, skills + memory state, all in one place
- **Individual developers** who want to understand how much their AI coding sessions cost
- **Teams** comparing Claude Code vs Gemini CLI vs Codex efficiency
- **Researchers** studying LLM agent behavior, tool call patterns, and reasoning chains
- **Engineering managers** tracking AI tooling ROI across projects
- **Prompt engineers** optimizing prompts by seeing exact token breakdowns

---

## Troubleshooting

**Port conflicts:** Check/kill processes on ports 3000 and 8000.
**Python not found:** Install Python 3.9+ and ensure it's in your PATH.  
**No sessions showing:** Run an agent (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.) first — TokenTelemetry needs existing log files.  
**Windows issues:** Run PowerShell as Administrator for the installer.
