# Install and set up codex-profiles

Use this file when a user asks an AI assistant to install or configure
`codex-profiles`. This is the public setup entry point. Repository maintenance
instructions are in `AGENTS.md`; project-internal outreach operations are under
`ops/outreach/` and are not part of installation.

## Goal

Install the `codex-profile` wrapper, verify its prerequisites, and create only
the profiles the user requests. Keep existing Codex and ChatGPT state intact.

`codex-profiles` is a community-maintained Bash wrapper, not an official OpenAI
project. It provides named Codex homes and named ChatGPT windows with separate
local state. It does not install Codex itself and it does not require the
repository's Node, Neon, release, test, or outreach tooling at runtime.

## 1. Inspect before changing anything

Run read-only checks first:

```sh
uname -s
command -v codex-profile || true
command -v codex || true
command -v brew || true
command -v npm || true
```

On macOS, also check for `/Applications/ChatGPT.app` only if the user wants
named Desktop windows. Do not open or inspect `auth.json`, cookies, sessions,
keychains, or other credentials.

If `codex-profile` is already installed, report its version and use the
installation's package manager for upgrades:

```sh
codex-profile version
codex-profile doctor
```

## 2. Install one way

Honor the user's requested package manager. Otherwise, prefer a package manager
already in use on the machine and execute only one of these methods.

Homebrew on macOS:

```sh
brew install Ducksss/tap/codex-profile
```

npm on macOS or Linux:

```sh
npm install -g codex-profile
```

The npm package name is singular. It installs both `codex-profile` and
`codex-profiles`; the plural npm package belongs to another project.

For the standalone, Nix, or source installation, use the current commands in
the [README](README.md#install). Do not clone the repository merely to install
the command when a supported package or standalone method is available.

The runtime needs Bash. CLI workflows also need a healthy upstream Codex CLI,
either on `PATH` or bundled with a detected ChatGPT app. If verification reports
that Codex is missing, explain that it is a separate OpenAI prerequisite and
ask before installing it. Follow the current
[official Codex CLI guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/codex/cli).

The ChatGPT desktop app is optional and is needed only for this project's
macOS `app` and `launcher create` workflows. If the user wants those workflows
and the app is missing, use the
[official ChatGPT desktop guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/app).

## 3. Verify the installation

```sh
codex-profile version
codex-profile doctor
```

Resolve a missing shell `PATH` entry or upstream Codex prerequisite before
creating profiles. Do not claim a healthy setup when `doctor` still reports a
required component as missing.

## 4. Create only requested profiles

Ask for profile names if the user did not provide them. Create them with `init`:

```sh
codex-profile init personal
codex-profile init work
```

For a user-driven terminal walkthrough, `codex-profile setup work` initializes
or reuses the profile and offers CLI login (default yes), workspace binding
(default no, path defaults to the current directory), and a macOS launcher
(default no). A final optional terminal integration step (default no) previews
the exact snippet on stderr before appending prompt support, completions, tab titles,
and completion notifications to the shell startup file. Setup never executes
that file and appends only missing integration lines on reruns. It refuses binding
or launcher conflicts, retains completed steps on failure, and can be rerun.
For noninteractive agent execution, use the explicit commands for the steps
the user requested.

Authentication is interactive and belongs to the user:

```sh
codex-profile login personal
codex-profile login work
```

Do not copy authentication from another profile. When the user explicitly
wants to share non-secret configuration, use the built-in allowlist:

```sh
codex-profile init personal-2 --share-with personal
```

To stop sharing later, `codex-profile detach personal-2` replaces allowlisted
root symlinks with independent copies. Close editors and pause plugin/config
updates first. Ordinary files and private state stay unchanged; broken or
unsafe targets are refused. Shared or copied configuration and plugins can
contain sensitive or executable content, so review the source before use.

On macOS, after the requested profile exists:

```sh
codex-profile app default
codex-profile app personal
```

`app default` preserves the stock ChatGPT session. A named `app` launch selects
matching `CODEX_HOME` and Electron data for the whole ChatGPT window across
Chat, Work, and Codex.

In a terminal, no-argument `cli` and `app` show an initialized-profile picker;
Enter selects the workspace-bound profile first or a valid current shell
profile when unbound. Both are marked separately. Exact names or menu numbers
select a profile; exact names take precedence, including numeric names. `#N`
explicitly selects menu item N. `q`, `Q`, or EOF cancel without an error message
and return 1. Select profiles named `q` or `Q` using `#N` for their menu item.
Unbound interactive `run` also offers the picker and optional binding; scripts
still fail on a missing binding. Use explicit profile names in agent scripts.
Optional `shell-init <bash|zsh|fish> --prompt` adds a dynamic `[codex:work]` prefix to the
existing prompt when `CODEX_PROFILE_NAME` and managed `CODEX_HOME` agree. Add
`--completions` to load tab completion at the same time. `shell-init` does not
edit shell startup files.

## 5. Report the result

Tell the user:

- which installation method and version were used;
- which profiles were created, if any;
- whether `doctor` passed and what remains unresolved;
- whether an interactive Codex or ChatGPT sign-in is still required.

Never print credential contents. Never copy or link `auth.json`, `sessions/`,
`state_5.sqlite`, logs, cookies, or Electron data between profiles. Local-state
separation is not an account, OS, or server-side boundary.
