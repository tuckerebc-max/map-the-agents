# Benchmark Results — SWE-bench Multi-Model

Django issues from [SWE-bench](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench), tested across multiple LLMs. Same prompt, same tools, same tasks. **Only difference: CodeDNA annotations.**

> **Metric: File Localization F1** — harmonic mean of recall and precision on files read vs ground truth. Isolates the navigation bottleneck that precedes code generation.

> **Statistical test:** Wilcoxon signed-rank test (one-tailed, H1: CodeDNA > Control).

> **Reproducibility status:** these are reported historical results. The raw run artifacts are not currently included in this checkout, so CI does not claim to reproduce or verify the numerical advantage. Publishing versioned raw traces and an end-to-end reproduction command is required before treating these figures as independently reproducible from the repository alone.

| Model | Tasks | Ctrl F1 | DNA F1 | **Δ F1** | p-value | Tasks Won |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash** | 5 | 60% | **72%** | **+13%** | 0.040* | 4/5 |
| **DeepSeek Chat** | 10 | 51% | **68%** | **+17%** | 0.001** | 10/10 |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | 5 | 60% | **69%** | **+9%** | 0.11 | 3/5 |

> Gemini 2.5 Flash: W+=14, N=5, p=0.040 ✅. DeepSeek Chat: W+=55, N=10, p=0.001 ✅ (6 tasks independently replicated by [@fabioscialanga](https://github.com/fabioscialanga)). Gemini 2.5 Pro: W+=12, N=5, p=0.11.

## When CodeDNA Helps Most

Empirical analysis across 5 tasks (Gemini 2.5 Flash, ≥5 runs each) suggests a pattern:

| Task type | Example | Δ F1 |
|---|---|---|
| **Clear dependency chain** — A calls B which delegates to C | `dbshell → client → subprocess` (12508) | **+9%** |
| **Delegation with backend fan-out** — one interface, N backends | `Trunc → ops.date_trunc_sql` (13495) | **+21%** |
| **Feature addition with flag gating** — new capability across feature/schema layers | `INCLUDE clause in Index` (11991) | **+17%** |
| **XOR feature with multi-layer propagation** | `Q() XOR support` (14480) | **+18%** |
| **Cross-cutting fix** — same pattern in N unrelated files, no shared ancestor | `__eq__ NotImplemented` (11808) | **~0%** |

### Per-task breakdown

| Task | What it is | Why hard without CodeDNA | Δ F1 (Flash / DeepSeek) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **12508** dbshell | Add `-c SQL` flag to `dbshell` management command | Entry point is obvious by name; 4 backend `runshell_db()` clients are hidden | +9% / +1% |
| **11991** INCLUDE | Add `INCLUDE` clause support to `Index` | `schema.py` is findable; 4 backend schema editors are not | +17% / +6% |
| **14480** Q() XOR | Add XOR operator to `Q()` and `QuerySet()` | ORM→SQL→backends cascade requires touching 7 files | +18% / +14% |
| **13495** Trunc tzinfo | Fix timezone handling in `TruncDay()` for non-DateTimeField | Per-backend `date_trunc_sql()` override not reachable by grep alone | **+22%** / −8% ⚠ |
| **11808** `__eq__` | Fix `__eq__` to return `NotImplemented` for unknown types | Entry is `models/base.py` (847 lines, generic name); 5 subclasses are unconnected | ≈0% / **+34%** |

> ⚠ Task 13495 shows a model-dependent anomaly: Flash benefits strongly (+22pp) while DeepSeek and Pro regress (−8/−9pp). Under investigation.

> **Transparency note on 11808:** the cross-cutting task was included deliberately to test the limits of the protocol. The benchmark annotations do **not** pre-populate a list of affected files — the agent must discover them independently. CodeDNA v0.7 shows Δ ≈ 0% on this task type. This is reported as a known limitation, not hidden. See [SPEC.md §2.4](../SPEC.md) for the proposed v0.9 feature (`cross_cutting_patterns:`) and why it would not constitute cheating.

**CodeDNA is most effective when there is a navigable call chain.** The `used_by:` graph guides the agent from entry point to all affected files. For cross-cutting concerns (same fix in many independent files with no shared ancestor), the benefit is smaller because there is no natural navigation path to follow.

### `related:` field — closing the cross-cutting gap (v0.9)

The `related:` field was introduced to address the cross-cutting limitation. While `used_by:` captures structural links (imports), `related:` captures **semantic links** — files that share the same logic without importing each other.

**Manual test: task 11532 (unicode domain crash in email)**

Ground truth: 5 files across `mail/`, `validators.py`, `encoding.py`, `html.py` — no import chain connects them. They share IDNA/punycode domain encoding logic independently.

| Condition | Files found | F1 |
|---|---|---|
| Control (no annotations) | 2/5 (only mail/) | **40%** |
| CodeDNA with `used_by:` only | 2/5 (only mail/) | **40%** |
| CodeDNA with `used_by:` + `related:` | 5/5 | **100%** |

The `related:` annotations were: `"shares IDNA/punycode domain encoding logic"` — a factual statement about the code, not a hint at the solution. Any developer documenting the project would write the same.

`related:` is populated by the LLM during annotation (pass 2 — cross-file pattern detection) or by agents during their work when they discover semantic connections.

## Annotation Integrity

A full audit confirmed no task-specific hints are embedded in the `codedna/` files. Where GT files appear in `used_by:` targets, it is because those files are genuine callers or subclasses — not cherry-picked. The cross-cutting task (11808, Δ≈0%) confirms this: annotations described the architecture accurately but gave no navigation advantage because there is no call chain to follow.

One correction was made during the audit: `base/schema.py` in task 11991 initially listed only `postgresql/schema.py` in `used_by:` — updated to include all 4 backend schema editors that genuinely inherit from it.

Full audit: [`benchmark_agent/claude_code_challenge/django__django-13495/BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md`](../benchmark_agent/claude_code_challenge/django__django-13495/BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md)

**Pattern:** cheaper models appear to benefit most. Flash (cheapest of the three) shows the strongest gain (p=0.040). This suggests annotating once may allow cheaper models to perform closer to more expensive ones — though the sample is small.

## Annotation Design Principle — Architecture, Not Answers

The key rule for `rules:` annotations: **describe the mechanism, not the solution**.

```python
# ❌ Wrong — gives away the answer
rules:   Fix mysql/operations.py, oracle/operations.py, postgresql/operations.py

# ✅ Correct — describes the delegation chain
rules:   Trunc.as_sql() delegates to connection.ops.date_trunc_sql() and
         time_trunc_sql(). Each backend implements these independently.
```

`used_by:` is a **navigation map**, not a to-do list. The agent reasons about which targets are relevant to the current task and opens only those.

## Inter-Agent Knowledge Accumulation

CodeDNA is designed for multi-agent environments — different models, different tools, different sessions. Each agent leaves knowledge for the next:

```
Agent A fixes a bug → adds Rules: "MUST filter soft-deleted users"
Agent B reads Rules: → avoids the same bug without re-discovering it
Agent C discovers an edge case → extends the Rules:
```

Unlike external docs (which go stale), `Rules:` annotations are co-located with the code — read every time the function is edited. The maintenance cost is real but proportional: in a traditional codebase, a human developer maintains this knowledge manually across sessions. With CodeDNA, agents maintain annotations as a side effect of normal work. Verification agents (see [SPEC.md §8.6](../SPEC.md)) can audit annotation accuracy automatically, which is not possible with free-form comments.

Current benchmark results are **zero-shot** — no fine-tuning on the protocol. Models follow `used_by:` and `rules:` by general language understanding alone.
