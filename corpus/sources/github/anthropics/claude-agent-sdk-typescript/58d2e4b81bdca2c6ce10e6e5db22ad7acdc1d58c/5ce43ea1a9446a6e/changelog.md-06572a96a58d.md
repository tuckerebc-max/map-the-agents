# Changelog

## 0.3.280

- Added optional `fireReason` to the task-notification `SDKMessageOrigin`; a local host's declared scheduled-task fire is honored only in a process it started with `CLAUDE_CODE_HOST_SCHEDULED_RUN=1`
- Added `verbatimPrompts` option: prompts are delivered as written — no `@path` expansion, no slash-command dispatch and, on current CLIs, no ambient attachments with the prompt (Claude Code 2.1.248+)
- Added `_meta` to `mcpServerStatus()` tool entries, carrying a tool's MCP Apps `ui` metadata so a host can find its `ui://` resource
- Added `readMcpResource()` (alpha) to read an MCP Apps `ui://` resource from an MCP server that Claude Code connected
- Improved `askSideQuestion()`: asked while a turn is running, it now sees that turn (its prompt, replies and finished tool results so far) instead of only the last completed turn
- Improved unattended retry (`CLAUDE_CODE_RETRY_WATCHDOG`): a usage-limit wait emits `rate_limit_event` (`rejected`, `resetsAt`) as it begins; `api_retry` heartbeats continue while sub-agent work waits
- Changed `session_state_changed` events (`CLAUDE_CODE_EMIT_SESSION_STATE_EVENTS=1`) to report `requires_action` while an MCP elicitation waits on the user, as for permission prompts
- Changed headless sessions to cancel an MCP server's pending form question when the tool call that drew it ends
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.280

## 0.3.279

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.279

## 0.3.278

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.278

## 0.3.277

- Added an optional `builtin` field to `SlashCommand`, set when a command is built into Claude Code
- Added `pasted_content` to `SDKUserMessage`: text the user pasted rather than typed, appended after the typed prompt
- Added optional remote-session latency fields (`first_text_post_ms`, `first_text_post_wall_ms`, `first_stream_post_queue_wait_ms`, `first_stream_post_queued_behind`) to the success result message
- Added `'userSettings'` as an `updateSettings()` source, accepting only `effortLevel`, which is saved for the session's current model as `/effort` saves it
- Fixed a resumed or forked session's `total_cost_usd`, `modelUsage` and `get_usage` totals starting at zero instead of continuing from the earlier turns (`maxBudgetUsd` is unchanged)
- Changed `SDKUsageReport` usage rows to always carry `severity` and `is_active`: the report relays only rows from a live server reply, and none while the usage fetch is failing
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.277

## 0.3.276

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.276

## 0.3.275

- Fixed a deferred tool call's result being emitted with internal keys such as `toolUseResult` instead of `tool_use_result` when the tool re-runs at the start of a resumed turn
- Fixed `getSessionMessages()` and `forkSession()` sometimes missing a turn's assistant message when called right after the turn's `result` message
- Fixed `forkSession({ upToMessageId })` rejecting a client-supplied `SDKUserMessage.uuid` that is not in UUID format
- Fixed `forkSession` rejecting the id that `getSessionMessages` returns for a message sent while Claude was working, and a fork showing a re-run prompt twice
- Fixed `getSessionMessages()` omitting a task notification or other queued message that Claude read while running a tool; it now comes back where Claude read it
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.275

## 0.3.274

- Added `startup_failure_reason` to the error result a stream-json run writes before exiting on a known startup failure
- Added `mcpServer: {name, source}` to `canUseTool` options, `mcp_server` to tool hook inputs, and `source` to MCP server status rows, so hosts can key trust on `source === "sdk"`
- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_MCP_STARTUP_WAIT_MS` (pass via `env`) to bound or disable (`0`) the first-turn wait for connecting MCP servers
- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_EMIT_STARTUP_TIMING=1` for stream-json hosts: the session's first `system/init` then carries the per-phase `startup_timing` breakdown that cloud sessions already emit
- Fixed `getSessionMessages()` omitting a message the user sent while Claude was running a tool; it now comes back as a user message where Claude read it
- Fixed missing `origin: {kind: 'task-notification'}` on the replayed user message when a background task finishes during a running turn (`--replay-user-messages`)
- Improved startup: the first turn no longer waits up to 2s for connecting MCP servers from settings files or plugins whose tools tool search defers; `options.mcpServers` servers are still awaited
- Changed queued background-task completions to share one model call: each still gets its own `result`, all but the last empty with `num_turns: 0`
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.274

## 0.3.273

- Added a `usage_report` sibling (`SDKUsageReport`: session totals, the plan's usage rows as the server sends them, extra usage) on the assistant message that delivers a headless `/usage` result
- Added `reason: "worker_restart"` to `task_notification` messages when a background task was stopped by a worker process restart
- Added a one-line transcript notice when the SDK host's `Stop` or `SessionStart` hook callback times out, shown once until the host answers again
- Fixed a `Stop`, `SubagentStop` or `SessionStart` hook callback that exceeds its timeout being reported as a hook failure and discarding other hooks' decisions; it now counts as no decision
- Fixed the browser SSE transport dropping the live slash-command list update (`system/commands_changed`)
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.273

## 0.3.272

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.272

## 0.3.271

- Added optional `omitClaudeMd` to `AgentDefinition` in the `agents` option, so a subagent can run without user, project and local CLAUDE.md files; managed policy files still load
- Fixed `listSessions`, `getSessionMessages` and `getSessionInfo` with `dir` on Windows not finding sessions for a directory on a mapped network drive or SUBST drive
- Fixed `sessionStore` resume losing the global config when it is stored under the legacy `.config.json` name or an OAuth-suffixed file name
- Removed `persistent` from the `MonitorInput` tool type
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.271

## 0.3.270

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.270

## 0.3.269

- Changed `user_message_uuid`, `user_message_uuids` and `resume_reason` to be stamped on a turn's first complete assistant message as well as its first stream event when partial messages are on
- Fixed `result.permission_denials` omitting Read, Edit and Write calls blocked by a path-scoped deny rule
- Fixed interrupts and permission responses being delayed while a host-started MCP server OAuth sign-in waited on a slow authorization server
- Fixed missing `tool_use_id` on `task_started` / `task_notification` when the CLI resumes a background subagent on its own; they now carry the agent's last call id
- Changed plan mode to route writes through `canUseTool` even when `allowDangerouslySkipPermissions` is set; the flag now only enables switching to `bypassPermissions` later
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.269

## 0.3.268

- Added `result_index` to result messages: the result's position in delivery order within the run, from 0
- Added `local_command` to the result message of a turn that ran a slash command without entering the model loop, carrying the command's name
- Added `hold_on_cache_impact` to the `reload_plugins` control request (`Query.reloadPlugins({ holdOnCacheImpact: true })`): holds a reload that would invalidate the session's prompt cache
- Added `resume_reason` to assistant, stream-event and result messages, set only on the automatic re-run of a turn a host restart interrupted
- Added `kind` (used, free, buffer, deferred) to each category in the `get_context_usage` control response, matching the `/context` result's `context_usage` rows
- Added optional `defaultToNo` and `suppressAlwaysAllowRule` hints to `canUseTool` options: the prompt should open on its decline option, or offer no persistent "always allow" choice
- Changed `setModel()` to confirm a model id the CLI doesn't know locally with the API the first time a session uses it, instead of refusing it as unrecognized
- Changed `user_message_uuid` on the automatic re-run of an interrupted turn to name that turn's last user prompt
- Changed the `initialize` success response to always include `pending_permission_requests` (empty when nothing is pending), so clients can tell that apart from an older CLI
- Changed the task-tracking tools (TaskCreate/Get/Update/List, TodoWrite) to be default tools only on Claude 3.x, Opus 4.0–4.7, Sonnet 4.0–4.6 and Haiku 4.5; elsewhere list them in `tools`/`allowedTools`
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.268

## 0.3.267

- Added `getCcrEvent(query, message)` and `getSseLastSequenceNum(query)` to the browser SDK's SSE transport, plus `fromSequenceNum`, `onCatchUpTruncated` and `onDeliveryUpdate` SSE options
- Changed `systemPrompt` recording to default on for custom prompts and appends (a mid-session prompt change takes effect at the next compaction); pass `snapshot: false` to keep per-request rendering
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.267

## 0.3.266

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.266

## 0.3.265

- Added `user_message_uuid` and `user_message_uuids` to a synthetic turn's first reply and result for a message sent with `isSynthetic: true` and a `uuid`, naming the message that started it
- Added `user_message_uuid` and `user_message_uuids` to the first reply and the result of a turn Claude Code started itself, such as a resume, naming the messages you sent that it picked up mid-turn
- Fixed `user_message_uuid` missing from the success result of a turn that sent no API request, such as a slash command
- Fixed multi-turn sessions resetting the shell working directory to the `cwd` option at each new user message; a `cd` made by the agent now persists across turns, as in the interactive app
- Changed `user_message_uuid` to be set on the first reply after each change of the message a turn is answering, instead of on one reply frame per turn
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.265

## 0.3.264

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.264

## 0.3.263

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.263

## 0.3.262

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.262

## 0.3.261

- Added `pluginDelivery: 'initialize'` to send `plugins` over stdin so the launch command line no longer grows with the plugin count (fixes Windows start failures with many plugins)
- Fixed `query()` throwing "Object not disposable" in runtimes without a native `Symbol.dispose`, such as Node ≤22 `vm` contexts (Jest's `node` environment, vitest `vmThreads`/`vmForks`) and Node <18.18
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.261

## 0.3.260

- Added optional `user_message_uuid` to `thinking_tokens` system messages, linking thinking progress to the user message that triggered the turn
- Added optional `first_content_frame_ms`, `first_stream_post_ms`, `first_stream_post_ack_ms` and `first_stream_post_wall_ms` fields to the success result message for remote-session latency breakdowns
- Fixed `managedSettings` `disableAutoMode: "disable"` (either spelling) being dropped by the restrictive-only filter instead of turning auto mode off for the spawned session
- Fixed `rewindFiles()` reporting success when no files could be restored (for example when checkpoint backups are missing); it now fails
- Changed `error_max_structured_output_retries` results to append the last StructuredOutput tool error; validation errors now name the offending key, allowed values, and actual length or count
- Changed `rate_limit_event` to also re-emit during an exceeded window on repeat 429s (about once per 30 seconds per limit window), so stream consumers can refresh stale rate-limit state
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.260

## 0.3.259

- Added `user_message_uuids` beside `user_message_uuid` on a turn's first reply frame and result: every user message the turn answered, so a reply to several merged messages can be matched to each
- Added `permissionPrompts: 'none'` option to auto-deny permission prompts in sessions with nobody to answer them, without disabling auto mode's classifier
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.259

## 0.3.258

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.258

## 0.3.257

- Added `thinkingTokens` to `ModelUsage` (a subset of `outputTokens`), and fixed result-message `usage.output_tokens_details.thinking_tokens` reporting 0 instead of the session's real count
- Added `tool_use_result.resourceLinks` on user messages carrying MCP tool results: the `resource_link` blocks the tool returned, so hosts can render returned files without parsing the result text
- Added optional `resource_links` to `task_notification` for an auto-backgrounded MCP tool call that completed, listing the files it returned by reference; join to the call via `tool_use_id`
- Fixed `mcp_reconnect` and `mcp_toggle` acting on a same-named `.mcp.json` / `~/.claude.json` server instead of the `--mcp-config` or `mcp_set_servers` one
- Fixed `mcp_toggle` disable also removing the tools of a sibling MCP server whose name extends the disabled one's (disabling `foo` dropped `foo__bar`'s tools)
- Changed `mcp_set_servers` to also list a server whose connection attempt throws under `added` (with a `failed` row in `mcp_status`), not only under `errors`
- Changed Agent tool calls to emit the periodic `tool_progress` heartbeat (`heartbeat: true`) like other long tools; heartbeat frames never clear a `subagent_retry` indicator
- Fixed the browser SDK bundle (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/browser`) never streaming any messages on engines without native `Symbol.dispose` (Safari/iOS, Firefox ESR, older Chromium)
- Fixed a background Bash task that is still running when a stream-json session ends right after an interrupt (stdin closed) never receiving its final `task_notification`
- Fixed `-p` giving up on a long-running background subagent without actually stopping it, so `background_tasks_changed` kept listing it and events for it arrived after its `stopped` notification
- Added `detail` option to `Query.getContextUsage()`: `'summary'` answers from the last response's usage and local estimates without per-category token-count API calls (default `'full'`)
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.257

## 0.3.256

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.256

## 0.3.255

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.255

## 0.3.254

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.254

## 0.3.253

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.253

## 0.3.252

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.252

## 0.3.251

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.251

## 0.3.250

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.250

## 0.3.249

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.249

## 0.3.248

- Added a per-server `timeout` for SDK-hosted MCP servers (`createSdkMcpServer({ timeout })`), overriding `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` for that server's tool calls

## 0.3.247

- Added an optional `ambient` flag to `task_started`, `task_notification` and `background_tasks_changed` task entries so hosts can exclude housekeeping tasks from activity indicators
- Fixed the `permissionMode` on per-turn `system/init` frames reporting the mode at turn start instead of the live mode, so a mode switch right after submitting no longer sends a stale value

## 0.3.246

- Added optional `user_message_uuid` to error result messages and to the first assistant message or `stream_event` of each turn, linking a reply or failure to the user message that triggered it
- Added `modelUsage[*].costBasis` (`'list' | 'managed' | 'unknown'`) reporting which price table each model's `costUSD` was computed from
- Added `modelPricing` support in the `managedSettings` option for hosts that set `CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_MANAGED_BY_HOST`; an admin-managed settings source that sets `modelPricing` still wins
- Added `perTaskStopAffordance` option: when set, `interrupt()` aborts only the current turn and keeps background agents and workflows running; otherwise (and for one-shot string prompts) they stop

## 0.3.245

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.245

## 0.3.244

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.244

## 0.3.243

- Added optional `queued_turn_count` to result messages: the number of queued user sends still pending when the result was produced, so hosts know whether another turn and result will follow
- Fixed `mcp_status` reporting a remote MCP server as connected after its connection dropped; it now reports pending while reconnecting, then connected or failed
- Fixed managed `disableAllHooks` also disabling hook callbacks registered through the `hooks` option; they now keep running, matching `allowManagedHooksOnly`
- Changed Read tool PDF results: the `document` block (or page `image` blocks for `pages` reads) now arrives inside the `tool_result` content instead of as a separate `user` message after it
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.243

## 0.3.242

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.242

## 0.3.241

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.241

## 0.3.240

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.240

## 0.3.239

- `total_cost_usd` / `modelUsage.costUSD` now include the 1.1× US-only-inference (data residency) multiplier when the response reports `inference_geo: "us"`
- A result held back for background subagents in one-shot mode now reports `total_cost_usd`, `duration_api_ms` and `modelUsage` as of its release, not the turn-end snapshot
- Fixed `SYSTEM_PROMPT_DYNAMIC_BOUNDARY` in an array `systemPrompt` being sent to the model as literal text on Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry, and gateway providers
- A repeated `initialize` on a running process is now followed by a `background_tasks_changed` snapshot of the live background tasks, so reconnecting hosts see work that is still running

## 0.3.238

- Added `is_backgrounded` and `spawn_depth` to `task_started` events for subagent tasks (`is_backgrounded` also on background Bash tasks)
- Added `suppressOriginalPrompt` to `UserPromptExpansion` hook output, matching `UserPromptSubmit`
- Added `command_lifecycle` state `refused`: a cross-session peer message the session's receive-side policy declines now reports this terminal state instead of producing no lifecycle frames
- Fixed SDK hook callbacks silently not applying after a host re-sends `initialize` to an already-running CLI; the response now reports `hooks_applied`
- Fixed `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION=true` not keeping `prompt_suggestion` messages on when the account is near, but not over, its usage limit
- Changed `vcs_state_changed` push events to emit one event per pushed branch

## 0.3.237

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.237

## 0.3.236

- `PostToolUse` hooks can return `hookSpecificOutput.classifierContext`, a short host-asserted note about a tool call's result that the auto mode permission classifier reads alongside that result

## 0.3.235

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.235

## 0.3.234

- Removed unused `bypass_permissions_disabled` from `ExitReason` type; the value was never emitted — TypeScript consumers with an explicit `case` branch get a compile error on upgrade (runtime unaffected)
- Updated the `ApiKeySource` type to include the values `system/init` actually reports (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `apiKeyHelper`, `/login managed key`, `none`)
- `vcs_state_changed` events report the directory the shell finished in (an inner `cd` is reflected)
- A peer `origin` injected by the host may declare the sending session's permission class (`fromMode`) so a same-class message is delivered to a recipient that runs without asking
- `SDKSystemMessage` (`system`/`init`) gains an optional `effort` field: the session's applied effort level, or `null` when none is sent. Set on Remote Control bridge init frames

## 0.3.233

- Notification hooks now fire for pending permission prompts on the SDK path, matching the interactive REPL behavior
- Todo/task-tracking tools (`TaskCreate`/`TaskGet`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskList`, `TodoWrite`) are no longer in the default tool surface on Opus 4.8, Sonnet 5, Fable 5, Mythos 5, and newer models; name them in the `tools` option or reference them in `allowedTools` (or set `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS=1`) to keep them

## 0.3.232

- Subagent MCP `tool_result` frames whose result carries `_meta` now emit `tool_use_result` as `{ content, _meta }` (matching main-loop frames) instead of a bare value
- `/context` result messages now carry a structured `context_usage` payload (new `SDKContextUsage` type), so consumers can render the context-usage card without parsing the markdown table
- `vcs_state_changed` events now populate the `branch` field for push operations, sourced from the pushed ref

## 0.3.231

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.231

## 0.3.230

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.230

## 0.3.229

- Added `terminal_slash_commands` to the system init message so Remote Control clients can hide terminal-oriented commands
- Changed conversations whose messages alone exceed the API's 32 MB limit to end the turn with `terminal_reason` `"api_error"` instead of `"image_error"`; `StopFailure` `error_details` is `"request_body_over_limit: …"`

## 0.3.228

- Agent tool results (`AgentOutput`): `usage.output_tokens_details` is now carried through

## 0.3.227

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.227

## 0.3.226

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.226

## 0.3.225

- Fixed background subagents in headless/SDK sessions never resuming when a background shell command or Monitor they left running completed, so the subagent never saw the result

## 0.3.224

- Added `crossSessionInbound` and `dialogExpiry` settings: cross-session messages sent to a session running with bypassed permissions are held for your approval, and messages to other sessions auto-deliver
- Added `subkind: 'peer-send-message'` to the `task-notification` member of `SDKMessageOrigin`, marking a notification raised by a cross-session `SendMessage`
- Added `source: 'archive'` plugin config variant to `Settings`, with `url` and optional `sha256`, for installing plugins from a zip over HTTPS
- Added sandbox credential-masking fields to `Settings`: `decode: 'jwt'` with `maskClaims`, `extract`/`onExtractNoMatch` on `envVars`, and `awsPairs`/`sigv4` for AWS SigV4 re-signing
- Fixed long (>200 char) project paths resolving to another project's session directory under a shared sanitized prefix; session list/get/rename/tag/fork/delete and `/resume` no longer cross projects

## 0.3.223

- Added `resumeDropsTurn` option: with `resumeSessionAt`, declares the turn a truncating resume intends to drop; the CLI refuses the resume if anything else would be discarded
- Result messages for repeated 529 overload failures now include `api_error_status: 529`, so SDK consumers can detect overload terminations structurally instead of matching message text
- Bare headless (`-p` / SDK `query()` without `canUseTool`) now emits `system/permission_denied` stream events when a tool call is auto-denied
- Documented `usage` vs `modelUsage` on stream-json results: `usage` is main-loop-only and per-turn; `modelUsage` is cumulative, covers all query-pipeline calls, and is the field for cost accounting

## 0.3.222

- Fixed `query({ sessionStore, resume })` not carrying user `settings.json` (`apiKeyHelper`, `env`, `hooks`, `permissions`) into the resumed subprocess

## 0.3.221

- Improved `skills` option validation: malformed names (delimiters or control characters) and wildcard-form names are rejected with a clear error; use `skills: 'all'` to enable every skill
- Fixed external MCP servers passed via the `mcpServers` option not being connected before the first turn, which caused the model to emit tool calls as literal text

## 0.3.220

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.220

## 0.3.219

- Added opt-in `cancel_queued` to the interrupt control request (capability `interrupt_cancel_queued_v1`): cancels queued and pending-dispatch messages alongside the abort
- Added `fast_mode_disabled_reason` to result and init messages so SDK hosts can explain why fast mode is off
- Added `DirectoryAdded` lifecycle hook event to the control protocol, fired when a new working directory is registered mid-session
- Fixed the initialize response reporting `fast_mode_state` from the spawn-time model after a model switch
- Added `sandbox.network.strictAllowlist` to SDK settings types for deterministically denying non-allowlisted hosts in sandboxed commands
- Added `workflowSizeGuideline` to SDK settings types for setting the advisory dynamic-workflow size guideline

## 0.3.218

- `SkillToolOutput` now reports `background: true` when a forked skill was dispatched as a detached background agent
- Fixed the result event's `api_error_status` reporting null for rate-limit and overloaded errors delivered mid-stream; it now reports 429/529
- Added `canonicalModel` and `provider` to each `modelUsage` entry in result messages so downstream billing can look up the correct rate table for `costUSD`

## 0.3.217

- Changed subagents to no longer spawn nested subagents by default (depth cap lowered from 5 to 1); set `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENT_SPAWN_DEPTH` to allow deeper nesting
- Added a cap on concurrently-running subagents (default 20, override with `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS`)
- Fixed Remote Control sessions not re-sending pending permission prompts to clients that connect after the prompt appeared

## 0.3.216

- Added optional `skippedLinks` count to `rewindFiles` responses for paths the rewind safety guards refused to restore or delete
- Added `tool_result_meta` sidecar to user messages (`non_execution_kind`, `user_feedback`) so consumers can classify denied, interrupted, or cancelled tool calls without string-matching result prose
- Added optional `user_message_uuid` and `request_sent_wall_ms` fields to the success result message for cross-host request-latency correlation

## 0.3.215

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.215

## 0.3.214

- `set_permission_mode` now rejects unrecognized permission modes with an error instead of silently adopting them; the `'manual'` alias is accepted at every ingress
- Added optional `subkind: 'scheduled-trigger'` to the `task-notification` member of `SDKMessageOrigin`, marking deliveries that are the fired prompt of a user-configured scheduled task
- `applyFlagSettings({effortLevel})` now accepts `'max'` in its TypeScript type (runtime already supported it)
- Assistant messages truncated by `interrupt()` now carry `aborted: true`, so consumers can distinguish a mid-stream partial from a completed message
- Added optional `subagent_type` and `subagent_retry` fields to `tool_progress` messages so clients can show a subagent waiting out an API rate-limit retry
- The `system/init` message's `plugins` entries and the `reload_plugins` response now include each plugin's manifest `version`
- SessionStart hooks now report source `"fork"` instead of `"resume"` when the session begins as a fork

## 0.3.213

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.213

## 0.3.212

- Fixed dash-leading `resumeSessionAt` and `sessionId` values being passed to the CLI as separate argv tokens; both now use equals-form (`--flag=value`)
- Agent tool output now includes the resolved model when a mid-turn model swap changed the subagent's model

## 0.3.211

- Fixed `--replay-user-messages` with `--include-partial-messages` emitting the turn-start user replay after the first content block instead of before the turn's content events
- Added `SDKAssistantMessage.timestamp` (ISO-8601) to the live stream, matching `SDKUserMessage`; older emitters omit it, consumers should fall back to receive time
- Added rate-limit message prefix buckets (`USAGE_LIMIT_ERROR_PREFIXES` and siblings) as `@alpha` exports for classifying rate-limit messages without hand-mirrored lists
- Improved process-exit errors to include the CLI's stderr output, so a failed child reports its actual cause instead of only an exit code

## 0.3.210

- Added `timedOutAfterMs` to `BashToolOutput`, set when a command is auto-backgrounded on timeout

## 0.3.209

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.209

## 0.3.208

- Fixed a caller abort during a pending SDK hook callback being converted into hook success, which let PreToolUse-gated tools execute after the abort
- Fixed a per-query resource leak in the SDK's process tracking when spawning the CLI fails (nonexistent or inaccessible executable path)
- Fixed an SDK `UserPromptSubmit` hook callback exceeding its timeout killing the entire query with an empty error; it now blocks the prompt with a clear timeout message and the session continues
- Fixed `extraArgs` values that look like flags (e.g. `resume: '--version'`) being parsed as their own CLI flags; dash-leading values are now bound with equals-form argv
- Fixed an abort-listener leak: streaming queries sharing one `AbortController` no longer accumulate `abort` listeners on its signal after each completed query
- Fixed `createSdkMcpServer` docs pointing at a nonexistent env var; the MCP tool-call timeout knob is `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT`
- Fixed an uncaught exception when writing to stdin after the Claude Code subprocess has exited

## 0.3.207

- Fixed `canUseTool` returning `{behavior: 'allow'}` without `updatedInput` being rejected as a deny with a raw ZodError message; the tool now runs with the original input per the documented contract
- The Agent tool's structured result now has a published SDK type (`AgentToolCompletedOutput`) that matches the emitted object exactly

## 0.3.206

- Added `command_lifecycle` frames to stream-json and SDK sessions, reporting each uuid-stamped message's terminal state (`queued`/`started`/`completed`/`cancelled`/`discarded`); zero-API results no longer report stale `duration_api_ms`

## 0.3.205

- Interrupt control responses now include `still_queued` (UUIDs of queued async messages that will still run), `Query.interrupt()` returns the typed receipt, and `system/init` advertises an `interrupt_receipt_v1` capability for feature detection
- Added structured `name` and `body` fields to peer-message session events, exposing the sender display name and decoded message body

## 0.3.204

- Added `terminal_reason` values `tool_deferred_unavailable` (deferred tool resume found the tool gone — previously an `is_error` result with no reason, read as a clean completion by lifecycle sweeps) and `turn_setup_failed` (the turn-input builder threw before the turn started). Both classify as dead turns, so commands consumed by them report `command_lifecycle` state `cancelled`
- Fixed the post-merge cancel backstop cancelling every member of a coalesced prompt batch when a cancel named only one: uncancelled siblings now re-merge and run (previously they were reported `cancelled` — on remote transports that acknowledged them as processed, silently dropping messages nobody cancelled)
- Added `terminal_reason` values `api_error`, `malformed_tool_use_exhausted`, `budget_exhausted`, and `structured_output_retry_exhausted`. Turns that die on an exhausted-API-retry or malformed-tool-use give-up previously reported `completed`; budget and structured-output exhaustion results previously omitted `terminal_reason`. Commands consumed by such turns now report `command_lifecycle` state `cancelled` instead of `completed` (dup-over-loss)
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.204

## 0.3.203

- Added a `background_tasks_changed` system message with the full set of live background tasks on every membership change, so consumers can track background activity as a level instead of pairing `task_started`/`task_notification` edges
- Fixed stable releases shipping a `sdk.d.ts` with unresolved type references that broke consumer typechecking with `skipLibCheck` disabled

## 0.3.202

- Added `parent_agent_id` field to subagent session messages for building depth-2+ agent trees from disk-persisted metadata
- Fixed `apply_flag_settings` with a non-object settings value crashing the session instead of returning a control error

## 0.3.201

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.201

## 0.3.200

- Added `'manual'` as an accepted alias for the `'default'` permission mode in SDK inputs
- Fixed `onSetPermissionMode` callback not firing for SDK-hosted Remote Control sessions
- Fixed `set_model` control request accepting unrecognized model strings; invalid models are now rejected before latching

## 0.3.199

- Added `requestId` to `canUseTool` callback options for correlating out-of-band permission responses, and support for returning `null` to suppress the SDK's automatic control response
- Added `blocked` field to `workflow_agent` progress events indicating when an agent was blocked by the auto-mode safety classifier
- Added `mode:"mask"` and per-credential `injectHosts` to `sandbox.credentials` settings types for injecting masked credentials into sandboxed commands

## 0.3.198

- Added a runtime warning when `canUseTool` is configured alongside `allowedTools` or `bypassPermissions`, which shadow the callback
- Added per-server `request_timeout_ms` option to `mcp_set_servers` control request
- Fixed `SDKUserMessage.isSynthetic` not being mapped to `isMeta` on ingestion, which could cause synthetic messages to be treated as real user messages
- Fixed workflow progress events silently dropping earliest agents from the list while the phase counter remained correct

## 0.3.197

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.197

## 0.3.196

- Added `prompt_id` field to hook input payloads for correlating hook events with OpenTelemetry prompt-level events
- Fixed control protocol deduplication dropping tool-use IDs after 1000 resolutions, which could cause duplicate `tool_result` deliveries in long-running sessions

## 0.3.195

- Added `Query.reinitialize()` to re-send the initialize control request and redeliver pending permission/dialog prompts after a transport gap
- Fixed `commands_changed` event not being emitted for synced skills when the skill list resolves before the change-detector subscribes

## 0.3.194

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.194

## 0.3.193

- Added `promptSuggestions` option to Browser SDK `query()` to opt the remote CLI into emitting follow-up suggestions
- Fixed brief console window flashes on Windows when spawning CLI subprocesses

## 0.3.192

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.192

## 0.3.191

- Added `old_source` field to `NotebookEdit` tool results for `replace` and `delete` operations, enabling inline diffs
- Added `seven_day_overage_included` to `SDKRateLimitInfo.rateLimitType` for per-model weekly usage limits
- Added `model_scoped` array to usage response for per-model weekly limit windows with utilization and reset times
- Fixed fast mode reverting to standard after the first turn when `settingSources` includes user/project settings

## 0.3.190

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.190

## 0.3.188

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.188

## 0.3.187

- Added `sandbox.credentials` to SDK settings types for configuring credential file and environment variable denial in sandboxed commands

## 0.3.186

- Added `agent_id` field to `can_use_tool` control requests — background agents now forward permission prompts to `canUseTool` instead of auto-denying, and stdin stays open while background tasks are running
- Added `ReadMcpResourceDirTool` tool type to SDK schemas — MCP resource directory listing is now a dedicated tool instead of a fallback inside `ReadMcpResourceTool`
- Added `rewind_conversation` control request for rewinding a conversation to a previous point with durable resume anchor support

## 0.3.185

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.185

## 0.3.184

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.184

## 0.3.183

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.183

## 0.3.182

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.182

## 0.3.181

- Added `errorCode`, `canUserPurchaseCredits`, and `hasChargeableSavedPaymentMethod` fields to `SDKRateLimitInfo` for detecting credits-required rate limits
- Added `tool_use_meta.icon_url` to assistant messages, populated from MCP server directory metadata
- Fixed SDK-hosted Remote Control sessions dropping `file_attachments` from inbound user messages

## 0.3.180

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.180

## 0.3.179

- Added optional `tool_use_meta` sidecar to assistant messages with display-friendly names for tool calls, so SDK consumers can render human-readable labels instead of raw wire names
- Fixed `-p` mode exiting before a completed background agent's notification was delivered, causing interim text to ship as the final result
- Fixed remote (stream-json) sessions appearing busy for the entire duration of a background workflow — the turn result is now emitted at the turn boundary and the session reports idle while background tasks continue

## 0.3.178

- Spawn failures on an existing native binary now explain the likely libc mismatch (musl binary on a glibc host) and suggest `options.pathToClaudeCodeExecutable`
- Permission-denied advisory messages now carry typed denial reasons (`safetyCheck`, `asyncAgent`), enabling SDK consumers to programmatically match denial causes
- Fixed `UserPromptSubmit` hook block feedback not being emitted to the SDK event stream — consumers can now see why a prompt was blocked by a hook instead of a silent hang
- Remote Control workers now send a `worker_shutting_down` system message on graceful exit so remote clients can show why the session ended
- Fixed MCP server-level specs (`mcp__server`, `mcp__server__*`) in `disallowedTools` being silently ignored — they now correctly remove all tools from the named server

## 0.3.177

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.177

## 0.3.176

- Fixed turn `result` messages being dropped when multiple turns complete while a background agent or workflow is running
- Fixed background agent, remote agent, and MCP task state not being restored when resuming a session via the SDK

## 0.3.175

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.175

## 0.3.174

- SDK consumers now receive the `system/model_fallback` message for all fallback triggers — `overloaded`, `server_error`, and `last_resort` in addition to `model_not_found` and `permission_denied` — and the message's `trigger` field gained the `server_error` and `last_resort` values

## 0.3.173

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.173

## 0.3.172

- SDK `plugins` option now accepts `skipMcpDiscovery: true` per plugin, so a host that manages a plugin's MCP connections itself can load skills/hooks from the plugin path without the engine re-reading its `.mcp.json`
- Fixed slash-followed-by-whitespace input (e.g. `/ add tests`) being silently dropped instead of treated as a plain prompt

## 0.3.171

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.171

## 0.3.170

- Added claude-fable-5 model and the fable alias to SDK model types. https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-fable-5-mythos-5
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.170

## 0.3.169

- Added an experimental `usage_EXPERIMENTAL_MAY_CHANGE_DO_NOT_RELY_ON_THIS_API_YET()` method on `Query` returning structured session cost, plan rate-limit, and local usage-behaviors data
- Added an `sse` option (`SSEOptions`) to `BrowserQueryOptions` as an alternative to `websocket`, for browser SDK consumers who prefer Server-Sent Events

## 0.3.168

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.168

## 0.3.167

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.167

## 0.3.166

- Fixed MCP resource tools not being injected for servers added at runtime via the `mcp_set_servers` control request

## 0.3.165

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.165

## 0.3.164

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.164

## 0.3.163

- `stop_task` control requests now return success when the target task is already gone (`not_found` or `not_running`), so SDK clients can reliably prune stale task chips
- Fixed SDK hosts being unable to add builtin MCP servers (e.g. `claude-in-chrome`) via `setMcpServers` when the CLI was launched without them
- Stop and SubagentStop hook events now support `additionalContext` in `hookSpecificOutput`, enabling non-error feedback that continues the turn

## 0.3.162

- Refusal error messages now carry `stop_reason: "refusal"` and `stop_details` on the assistant message and in session transcripts, so SDK consumers can detect refusals without text-matching the error content
- Agent SDK sessions on native builds now default to fast embedded `find`/`grep` search in Bash, matching the interactive CLI, instead of always registering the dedicated Grep/Glob tools. To keep the dedicated tools (e.g. to intercept searches via `canUseTool` or hooks), name them in the `tools` option or reference them in `allowedTools`

## 0.3.161

- The `initialize` control request is now idempotent: a second `initialize` returns the same success payload instead of an `Already initialized` error. `ControlResponse` gains an optional `pending_permission_requests` field, mirroring `ControlErrorResponse`
- `applyFlagSettings` now live-applies `agent` changes: switching the active agent (or passing `null` to reset) takes effect on the next turn in a running session

## 0.3.160

- Fixed SDK hook callbacks swallowing abort signals: aborting during a PostToolUse hook now ends the turn with a final `result` message instead of hanging the calling process

## 0.3.159

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.159

## 0.3.158

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.158

## 0.3.157

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.157

## 0.3.156

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.156

## 0.3.155

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.155

## 0.3.154

- Fixed stdio MCP servers being incorrectly restarted on every reconcile pass due to config-equality false positives

## 0.3.153

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.153

## 0.3.152

- `SessionStart` hooks can now return `reloadSkills: true` to trigger a skill re-scan, and set the session title via `hookSpecificOutput.sessionTitle`
- Added a `MessageDisplay` hook event that lets hooks transform or hide assistant message text as it is displayed

## 0.3.151

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.151

## 0.3.150

- The `api_retry` system message now reports `error: 'overloaded'` for 529 responses, instead of `'rate_limit'` (which is now reserved for 429). Consumers that handled 529 via `error === 'rate_limit'` should also match `'overloaded'`, or switch to `error_status === 529`.
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.150

## 0.3.149

- Fixed `options.env` dropping `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_VERSION` (used for `User-Agent` and telemetry) when a custom environment is supplied, and corrected the `Options.env` docs to state that the value replaces the subprocess environment rather than merging with `process.env`

## 0.3.148

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.148

## 0.3.147

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.147

## 0.3.146

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.146

## 0.3.145

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.145

## 0.3.144

- Assistant messages and `StopFailure` hooks now report `error: 'model_not_found'` when the selected model doesn't exist or isn't available, instead of the generic `'invalid_request'`. The `api_error_status` field on result messages is now documented.
- Added `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/extract` export for `bun build --compile` consumers: import the platform native binary with `with { type: 'file' }`, call `extractFromBunfs(binPath)` to copy it out of the compiled executable's virtual filesystem, and pass the result to `options.pathToClaudeCodeExecutable`

## 0.3.143

- `@anthropic-ai/sdk` and `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` are now `peerDependencies` instead of `dependencies`. Runtime is unaffected (both are bundled); npm/bun/pnpm auto-install them. yarn classic users should add them explicitly for full TypeScript type resolution

## 0.3.142

- **Breaking:** Removed the v2 session API (`unstable_v2_createSession`, `unstable_v2_resumeSession`, `unstable_v2_prompt`, `SDKSession`, `SDKSessionOptions`), deprecated since 0.2.133. Use `query()` — pass an `AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage>` for multi-turn, or `options.resume` to continue a session.
- **Breaking:** MCP servers now connect in the background by default; sessions start immediately and slow servers report `status: "pending"` in `init` until ready. Set `MCP_CONNECTION_NONBLOCKING=0` to restore the old behavior of waiting up to 5s before the first query, or mark a server `alwaysLoad: true` to require it in turn 1.
- **Breaking:** Headless and SDK sessions now use Task tools (`TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskGet` / `TaskList`) instead of `TodoWrite`, deprecated since 0.2.136. Tool consumers should accumulate by task ID instead of replacing a snapshot list.
- Surfaced `request_id`, `subagent_type`, and `task_description` on SDK message types and task system events
- Headless `--sdk-url` sessions now exit non-zero with a stderr diagnostic when the remote transport closes permanently (401/403/404 or WS permanent close), instead of silently exiting 0

## 0.2.141

- `TaskCreateInput`, `TaskCreateOutput`, `TaskGetInput`, `TaskGetOutput`, `TaskUpdateInput`, `TaskUpdateOutput`, `TaskListInput`, and `TaskListOutput` types are now exported from `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/sdk-tools` and included in the `ToolInputSchemas`/`ToolOutputSchemas` unions
- Aligned `@anthropic-ai/sdk` dependency to ^0.93.0

## 0.2.140

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.140

## 0.2.139

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.139

## 0.2.137

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.137

## 0.2.136

- Added `resolveSettings()` (alpha) to inspect effective merged settings without spawning the Claude CLI; reads MDM (plist/HKLM/HKCU) for parity with CLI startup
- Deprecated `TodoWrite` tool — future versions will switch to Task tools (`TaskCreate`, `TaskGet`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskList`)

## 0.2.135

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.135

## 0.2.134

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.134

## 0.2.133

- Deprecated the unstable V2 session API (`unstable_v2_createSession` / `unstable_v2_resumeSession` / `unstable_v2_prompt`) — use `query()` instead
- Deprecated passing `'Skill'` in `allowedTools` — use the `skills` option instead
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.133

## 0.2.132

- Documented `applyFlagSettings()` in the TypeScript Agent SDK reference and added support for `null` on top-level keys to clear flag-settings overrides
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.132

## 0.2.131

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.131

## 0.2.130

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.130

## 0.2.129

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.129

## 0.2.128

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.128

## 0.2.127

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.127

## 0.2.126

- Added `origin` to result messages (`SDKResultSuccess` / `SDKResultError`) — forwards the triggering message's `SDKMessageOrigin` so consumers can distinguish user-prompted results from `task-notification` followups

## 0.2.125

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.125

## 0.2.124

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.124

## 0.2.123

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.123

## 0.2.122

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.122

## 0.2.121

- Added `updatedToolOutput` to `PostToolUseHookSpecificOutput` for replacing tool output on all tools. `updatedMCPToolOutput` is deprecated.

## 0.2.120

- Added `skills` option (`string[] | 'all'`) to control which Skills are loaded into the main session, matching the Python SDK

## 0.2.119

- Added `forwardSubagentText` option to stream subagent text deltas to SDK consumers
- `excludeDynamicSections` now keeps static auto-memory instructions in the cacheable system-prompt block; only the per-user memory directory path and per-machine environment values are relocated to the first user message
- Long-running SDK sessions now reconnect claude.ai-proxied MCP servers after a transport-stream abort
- `SessionStore.append()` failures are now retried up to 3 times with short backoff before the batch is dropped and `mirror_error` is emitted

## 0.2.118

- Added `Options.managedSettings` for embedders to pass policy-tier settings to the spawned CLI in-memory, honored below IT-controlled managed sources

## 0.2.117

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.117

## 0.2.116

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.116

## 0.2.115

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.115

## 0.2.114

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.114

## 0.2.113

- Changed the SDK to spawn a native Claude Code binary (via a per-platform optional dependency) instead of bundled JavaScript
- Added `sessionStore` option (alpha) to `query()` and session helpers for mirroring session transcripts to external storage, with `SessionStore`/`SessionKey`/`SessionStoreEntry` types, `InMemorySessionStore` reference implementation, and `importSessionToStore()` for migrating existing sessions
- Added `deleteSession()` for removing a session from disk or a `SessionStore`
- Added `SDKMirrorErrorMessage` (`subtype: 'mirror_error'`) to the `SDKMessage` union — emitted when a `sessionStore.append()` batch fails
- **Breaking**: `options.env` once again replaces `process.env` for the CLI subprocess instead of overlaying it. To add or override individual variables, pass `env: { ...process.env, MY_VAR: "x" }`
- Added `title` option to `query()` — sets the session title and skips auto-generation
- Added OpenTelemetry trace context propagation — the caller's active trace context is forwarded to the CLI subprocess so spans parent under your distributed trace

## 0.2.112

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.112

## 0.2.111

- Opus 4.7 is now available! This version of the SDK is required to use it.
- `mcp_set_servers` control request: remote (http/sse) server entries can now carry per-tool `permission_policy` values, which are applied to the session's allow/deny rules
- `startup()` and `WarmQuery` are now part of the public TypeScript API
- Changed `options.env` to overlay the inherited `process.env` instead of replacing it

## 0.2.110

- Fixed `unstable_v2_createSession` not respecting `cwd`, `settingSources`, and `allowDangerouslySkipPermissions` options
- Added optional `shouldQuery` field to `SDKUserMessage` — set to `false` to append a user message without triggering an assistant turn; fixed `shouldQuery: false` messages incorrectly triggering auto-title generation, prompt suggestions, and `UserPromptSubmit` hooks
- Auto session-title generation now respects `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_TERMINAL_TITLE`

## 0.2.109

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.109

## 0.2.108

- `SDKStatus` now includes `'requesting'`; when `includePartialMessages` is enabled, a `{type:'system', subtype:'status', status:'requesting'}` message is emitted before each API request in the stream

## 0.2.107

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.107

## 0.2.106

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.106

## 0.2.105

- Added `system/memory_recall` event and `memory_paths` on `system/init` for SDK renderers to surface memory operations
- Fixed `error_max_structured_output_retries` being emitted when the final retry attempt succeeded, discarding valid structured output

## 0.2.102

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.102

## 0.2.101

- Security: bumped `@anthropic-ai/sdk` to `^0.81.0` and `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to `^1.29.0` to resolve GHSA-5474-4w2j-mq4c and transitive hono advisories
- Fixed resume-session temp directory leaking on Windows when subprocess file handles weren't released before cleanup, and on macOS/APFS when `await using` disposal raced its own cleanup callback
- Fixed `MaxListenersExceededWarning` when running 11+ concurrent `query()` calls

## 0.2.100

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.100

## 0.2.99

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.99

- Fixed CJK and other multibyte text being corrupted with U+FFFD in stream-json input/output when chunk boundaries split a UTF-8 sequence
- Fixed MCP server child processes not being cleaned up when an SDK `query()` session ends
- Fixed a failed error-report write crashing the SDK process with `unhandledRejection`
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.94

## 0.2.93

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.93

## 0.2.92

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.92

## 0.2.91

- Added optional `terminal_reason` field to result messages, exposing why the query loop terminated (`completed`, `aborted_tools`, `max_turns`, `blocking_limit`, etc.)
- Added `'auto'` to the public `PermissionMode` type
- Changed `sandbox` option to default `failIfUnavailable` to `true` when `enabled: true` is passed — `query()` will emit an error result and exit if sandbox dependencies are missing, instead of silently running unsandboxed. Set `failIfUnavailable: false` to allow graceful degradation.
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.91

## 0.2.90

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.90

## 0.2.89

- Added `startup()` to pre-warm the CLI subprocess before `query()`, making the first query ~20x faster when startup cost can be paid upfront
- Added `includeSystemMessages` option to `getSessionMessages()` to optionally include system messages in session history
- Added `listSubagents()` and `getSubagentMessages()` functions to retrieve subagent conversation history from sessions
- Added `includeHookEvents` option to enable hook lifecycle messages (`hook_started`, `hook_progress`, `hook_response`) for all hook event types
- Fixed `ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END` errors when single-turn queries with SDK MCP servers or hooks have control responses arriving after the result message
- Fixed Zod v4 field `.describe()` metadata being dropped from `createSdkMcpServer` tool schemas
- Fixed `side_question` returning null on resume before the first turn completes
- Fixed `settingSources` empty array causing `--setting-sources ""` to consume the next CLI flag
- Fixed error result messages (`error_during_execution`, `error_max_turns`, `error_max_budget_usd`) to correctly set `is_error: true` with descriptive messages
- Fixed MCP servers getting permanently stuck in a failed state after a connection race — they now retry on the next message

## 0.2.87

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.87

## 0.2.86

- Added `getContextUsage()` control method to retrieve a breakdown of context window usage by category
- Made `session_id` optional in `SDKUserMessage` type — callers no longer need to provide a session ID when sending user messages, as the SDK assigns one automatically
- Fixed TypeScript types resolving to `any` by adding `@anthropic-ai/sdk` and `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` as dependencies
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.86

## 0.2.85

- Added `reloadPlugins()` SDK method to reload plugins and receive refreshed commands, agents, and MCP server status
- Fixed PreToolUse hooks with `permissionDecision: "ask"` being ignored in SDK mode
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.85

## 0.2.84

- Added `taskBudget` option for API-side token budget awareness, allowing the model to pace tool use within a token limit
- Added `enableChannel()` method and `capabilities` field on `McpServerStatus` for SDK-driven MCP channel activation
- Exported `EffortLevel` type (`'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'max'`) for consumers to reference effort values directly
- Fixed showing "[Request interrupted by user]" for errors that were not caused by user interruption
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.84

## 0.2.83

- Added `seed_read_state` control subtype to seed `readFileState` with `{path, mtime}` so `Edit` works after the originating `Read` was removed from context
- Changed `session_state_changed` events to opt-in: set `CLAUDE_CODE_EMIT_SESSION_STATE_EVENTS=1` to receive them
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.83

## 0.2.82

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.82

## 0.2.81

- Fixed `canUseTool` not providing a working `addRules` suggestion when a write under `.claude/skills/{name}/` hits the bypass-immune safety check
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.81

## 0.2.80

- Fixed `getSessionMessages()` dropping parallel tool results — sessions with parallel tool calls now return all tool_use/tool_result pairs
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.80

## 0.2.79

- Added `'resume'` to the `ExitReason` type for distinguishing resume-triggered session ends in hooks
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.79

## 0.2.78

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.78

## 0.2.77

- Added `api_retry` system messages when retrying transient API errors, exposing attempt count, max retries, delay, and error status
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.77

## 0.2.76

- Added `forkSession(sessionId, opts?)` for branching conversations from a point

## 0.1.0

- **Merged prompt options**: The `customSystemPrompt` and `appendSystemPrompt` fields have been merged into a single `systemPrompt` field for simpler configuration
- **No default system prompt**: The Claude Code system prompt is no longer included by default, giving you full control over agent behavior. To use the Claude Code system prompt, explicitly set:
- **No filesystem settings by default**: Settings files (`settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`), slash commands, and subagents are no longer loaded automatically. This ensures SDK applications have predictable behavior independent of local filesystem configurations
- **Explicit settings control**: Use the new `settingSources` field to specify which settings locations to load: `["user", "project", "local"]`
- **Programmatic subagents**: Subagents can now be defined inline in code using the `agents` option, enabling dynamic agent creation without filesystem dependencies. [Learn more](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/subagents)
- **Session forking**: Resume sessions with the new `forkSession` option to branch conversations and explore different approaches from the same starting point. [Learn more](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/sessions)
- **Granular settings control**: The `settingSources` option gives you fine-grained control over which filesystem settings to load, improving isolation for CI/CD, testing, and production deployments
