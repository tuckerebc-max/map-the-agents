# Honeydew AI Plugins for Coding Agents

Skills and tools powered by the [Honeydew MCP](https://honeydew.ai/docs/integration/mcp) that help coding agents build semantic models and analyze data through natural conversation.

## Example Use Cases

**Query your data** — Ask "Show me revenue by region for last quarter." Your coding agent discovers the right entities and metrics, runs the query through the semantic layer, and returns the results.

**Build a semantic model** — Ask "I added a new orders table — create an entity with revenue and order count metrics." Your coding agent imports the table, defines attributes and metrics following your naming conventions, and validates the result.

**Investigate anomalies** — Ask "Why did churn spike last month?" Your coding agent runs a multi-step deep analysis, explores correlations across your model, and surfaces the key drivers with supporting data.

## Prerequisites

- A coding agent that supports plugins/skills (e.g., [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli), [Cursor](https://cursor.com), [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-cli), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), or any agent with MCP support)
- A Honeydew AI workspace with the [Honeydew MCP server](https://honeydew.ai/docs/integration/mcp) configured

## Installation

### Claude Code

Add this marketplace to Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add honeydew-ai/honeydew-ai-coding-agents-plugins
```

Then install the plugin:

```
/plugin install honeydew-ai@honeydew-ai-claude-plugins
```

Then reload plugins to activate:

```
/reload-plugins
```

### Codex

Add this marketplace to Codex:

```
codex plugin marketplace add honeydew-ai/honeydew-ai-coding-agents-plugins
```

Then open the plugin directory and install the plugin:

```
codex
/plugins
```

If the marketplace was already added before this repo exposed the Codex wrapper path, refresh it first:

```
codex plugin marketplace upgrade honeydew-ai-coding-agents-plugins
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

Add this marketplace to Copilot CLI:

```
/plugin marketplace add honeydew-ai/honeydew-ai-coding-agents-plugins
```

Then install the plugin:

```
/plugin install honeydew-ai@honeydew-ai-github-copilot-plugins
```

### Cursor

1. In your team or organization settings, go to [cursor.com/dashboard/plugins](https://cursor.com/dashboard/plugins) (or click **Plugins** on the left side menu).
2. Scroll down to **Team Marketplaces** and click **Add Marketplace** (or select an existing one).
3. Within the Marketplace, click **Add Plugin**, paste `https://github.com/honeydew-ai/honeydew-ai-coding-agents-plugins`, and click **Add 1 plugin**.
4. Optionally, enable **auto-refresh** to get updates automatically.
5. Go back to the plugins page, search for the Honeydew plugin, and click **Add**.

### Gemini CLI

Install the Honeydew extension (skills + Honeydew MCP server):

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/honeydew-ai/honeydew-ai-coding-agents-plugins
```

### Other Coding Agents

For coding agents that support MCP, configure the [Honeydew MCP server](https://honeydew.ai/docs/integration/mcp) and use the skill files in this repository as prompts or instructions. The skills are written as agent-agnostic markdown documentation that any coding agent can consume.

## Updating an Installed Plugin

Installing pins the version you installed. Most agents keep a cached copy of the marketplace, so an update is two steps: refresh the marketplace, then update the plugin itself.

### Claude Code

In a session, open the plugin manager and choose the update action:

```
/plugin
```

Then apply it:

```
/reload-plugins
```

Or from the shell — refresh the marketplace first, or the update will not see a new version:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update honeydew-ai-claude-plugins
claude plugin update honeydew-ai
```

Restart Claude Code to apply. `claude plugin list` shows the installed version.

### Codex

Codex has no plugin-level upgrade command. Refresh the marketplace snapshot, then re-add the plugin to pick up the new version:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade honeydew-ai-coding-agents-plugins
codex plugin add honeydew-ai@honeydew-ai-coding-agents-plugins
```

The `/plugins` menu inside a `codex` session does the same thing interactively.

### GitHub Copilot CLI

Refresh the marketplace catalog, then reinstall:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace update honeydew-ai-github-copilot-plugins
```

```
/plugin install honeydew-ai@honeydew-ai-github-copilot-plugins
```

### Cursor

If you enabled **auto-refresh** on the marketplace at install time, updates arrive on their own. Otherwise, go back to [cursor.com/dashboard/plugins](https://cursor.com/dashboard/plugins), open the Team Marketplace holding the plugin, and refresh it — the plugin picks up the new version from there.

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions update honeydew-ai-tools
```

`gemini extensions update --all` updates every installed extension, and `gemini extensions list` shows the installed version. Installing with `gemini extensions install --auto-update` keeps it current without this step.

### Other Coding Agents

Pull the latest skill files from your clone of this repository. Nothing is cached elsewhere — the skills are read from disk.

## Available Skills

The `honeydew-ai` plugin includes 13 skills:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **model-exploration** | Explore the semantic model — list entities, search fields, inspect relationships, and discover warehouse tables |
| **workspace-branch** | Manage workspaces and branches — set session context, create/delete branches, review branch history, and open pull requests |
| **entity-creation** | Create entities — the foundational business concepts built from data warehouse tables |
| **relation-creation** | Define relationships between entities with join types, cardinality, and complex join conditions |
| **attribute-creation** | Create calculated attributes (dimensions) — per-row virtual columns defined with SQL expressions |
| **metric-creation** | Create metrics (KPIs) — reusable aggregations like totals, averages, ratios, and growth rates |
| **context-item-creation** | Create context items — instructions, skills, knowledge pointers, and memory events that give the AI analyst persistent knowledge about your organization |
| **domain-creation** | Create domains — curated subsets of the semantic model exposed to specific teams or use cases |
| **validation** | Mandatory post-creation validation — type-specific sanity checks, cross-validation, and error handling |
| **query** | Query data using structured YAML perspectives, natural language questions, or multi-step deep analysis |
| **query-debugging** | Review and inspect past query executions — what ran, from which client (BI tools, SQL interface, MCP, deep analysis), the semantic YAML and compiled SQL behind a run, and debugging failures |
| **filtering** | Advanced filtering syntax — comparisons, string matching, date handling, nulls, and full-text search |
| **conversation-review** | Bulk review past analysis conversations — categorize user feedback, build action items, and apply semantic/context layer improvements on a branch |

## Supported Data Warehouses

## Building a Release

### Claude-specific zip (claude.ai private marketplace)

The `honeydew-ai-claude-<version>.zip` artifact is used to install this plugin via the [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) web interface as a private marketplace plugin. It packages the plugin in the layout claude.ai expects: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at the zip root, alongside `.mcp.json`, `hooks/`, `assets/`, and all skill markdown files.

**To install on claude.ai:**
1. Download the zip — permanent link to the latest version:
   `https://github.com/honeydew-ai/honeydew-ai-coding-agents-plugins/releases/latest/download/honeydew-ai-claude.zip`
2. In claude.ai, go to **Settings → Plugins → Add plugin → Upload zip**
3. Upload the zip — the plugin will appear in your private marketplace

Release zips are built automatically by CI and attached to each GitHub Release. To build one locally (e.g. for testing):

```bash
./scripts/build-release-claude.sh
```

This generates `dist/honeydew-ai-claude-<version>.zip` from the repo root.
