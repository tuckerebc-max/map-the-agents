Pagecast is a local-first publishing tool for agent-generated reports and small
static web projects: preview files, publish, re-sync, rename links,
password-protect pages, and revoke URLs — from a local admin UI or headless
`pagecast` commands. Good fits: HTML reports and dashboards, Markdown docs and
plans, static mini apps from `dist`/`build`/`out`. Not a fit: server-rendered
apps that need a running backend (export static assets first).

## Quick Start

Requires Node.js 20.19+ and a Cloudflare account (for publishing). No global install:

```sh
npx pagecast
```

This starts the local app and opens the admin UI:

- Admin UI — `http://pagecast.localhost:4173`
- Local preview/public origin — `http://pagecast.localhost:4174`
- Pagecast Home — `~/.pagecast/home/` (Cloudflare target, publication registry, settings)
- Workspace metadata — `.pagecast/` in the current directory

One OS user profile owns one Pagecast Home and Cloudflare subdomain. Run the CLI
from the relevant project; use `--data-dir` only for an intentionally isolated
CI/container profile. If the default ports are busy, Pagecast falls forward to
the next free pair and remembers it.

In the admin UI, confirm the suggested Home subdomain and click **Connect
Cloudflare** — Pagecast runs Wrangler's scoped browser OAuth flow (Cloudflare
labels the app **Wrangler**) and resumes setup after consent. From a source
checkout, run `npm start` instead. Prefer containers? See
[Run with Docker](#run-with-docker).

Run in the background, or (macOS) install a login service plus a local-only
`http://pagecast.localhost` redirect:

```sh
npx pagecast background start && npx pagecast open
npx pagecast setup-local-url
# manage: pagecast local-url status|remove, pagecast background service status|uninstall
```

Headless/advanced setup:

```sh
npx pagecast pages setup --project your-pagecast-home
# multiple accounts? add  --account <account-id>
# automation? export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN (scoped Pages:Edit) + CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID
```

**Upgrading from 0.5:** stop the old process (`npx pagecast@0.5.0 background stop`),
reinstall the macOS login service if you use it (`npx pagecast@0.7.0 background
service install`), and reload the unpacked Chrome extension from the matching
release. The first 0.6 launch creates `~/.pagecast/home/` and imports compatible
workspace publications without changing URLs; publications on other Cloudflare
projects remain legacy targets until you explicitly attach or move them.

## Publish From The Terminal

```sh
# An HTML or Markdown file → a memorable /p/<slug>/ link (source folder included)
npx pagecast publish "/absolute/path/report.html" --json

# Set an expiry — 7d, 12h, or never (default 30d)
npx pagecast publish "/absolute/path/report.html" --expires 7d --json

# Force a new URL, or explicitly update a known one
npx pagecast publish "/absolute/path/report.html" --new-link --json
npx pagecast publish "/absolute/path/report.html" --update <url-or-token> --json

# A built static project → publish its entry file
npm run build && npx pagecast publish ./dist/index.html --json

# A whole folder → replace a named Pages project directly (--branch defaults to main)
npx pagecast pages deploy ./dist --project my-static-site --json
```

Things to know:

- `publish` copies every non-hidden, non-symlink file under the source folder,
  referenced or not — publish from a clean folder and keep secrets elsewhere.
- New links are **unlisted**: a memorable label plus a 128-bit suffix. Anyone
  with the URL can view it — unlisted is not private. The admin UI's **Short
  public link** toggle (or renaming to a vanity slug) makes a guessable public
  drop instead. Password protection is the access-control option.
- Publishing is context-aware: repeating a publish for the same item in the same
  agent context updates the existing URL. Context comes from `--context-id`,
  `PAGECAST_CONTEXT_ID`, `CODEX_THREAD_ID`, `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`, then a
  workspace/source fallback; override matching with `--new-link` or `--update`.
- `pages deploy` is a separate, stateless whole-site operation on the named
  project. It never changes the project used for managed `/p/...` links —
  use a separate project unless replacing the managed site is intentional.
- `statusCode 401` → authentication required (interactive runs start Wrangler
  auth automatically); `statusCode 409` → conflict, follow the returned message.

## Activity Analytics

Optional, enabled in Settings: Pagecast deploys a Worker + D1 database to your
Cloudflare account and shows views, anonymous uniques, and recent events beside
each link, plus a global **Activity** view. Events carry coarse geo, device
class, and referrer hostname; raw IPs are HMACed with a per-Home secret and
discarded, and detailed events expire after 30 days. Analytics is audit
visibility, not access control — use password protection to restrict access.

## Password Protection

Gate any published page from the admin UI (**Password protection** toggle) or headlessly:

```sh
npx pagecast publish "/absolute/path/report.html" --password "your-password" --json
npx pagecast publish "/absolute/path/report.html" --no-password --json   # remove it
```

Enforced at the edge by a generated Cloudflare Pages Function covering every
file of a multi-file report. Older immutable deployments keep the gate state
they shipped with — prune deploy history if an unprotected snapshot must stop
being reachable. Crypto and security model:
[PASSWORD-PROTECTION.md](PASSWORD-PROTECTION.md).

## Deploy History

Every publish or re-sync creates an immutable whole-site Cloudflare deployment
with its own `<hash>.pages.dev` URL. Manage them from the admin UI
(**Settings → Deploy history**) or the terminal:

```sh
npx pagecast pages deployments list --json
npx pagecast pages deployments delete <id> --json     # the live deployment is protected
npx pagecast pages deployments prune --keep 5 --yes --json
```

Removing a snapshot never affects your live site or pages. But expiry, password
changes, and revoke apply only to the replacement deployment — prune history
when old snapshot URLs must stop working.

## Use From Coding Agents

Pagecast ships a Codex-native skill and a portable Agent-Skills file. An
explicit "Publish this as a Pagecast" instruction publishes immediately; a
proactive agent suggestion still asks once.

```sh
# Skills.sh (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and other supported agents)
npx skills add https://github.com/amal-david/pagecast --skill publish-report

# Claude Code plugin (includes the report-detection hook)
/plugin marketplace add Amal-David/pagecast
/plugin install pagecast@pagecast

# Manual install from a clone
cp -R .codex/skills/publish-report ~/.codex/skills/                              # Codex
cp plugin/skills/publish-report/SKILL.md /path/to/your-agent/skills/publish-report/SKILL.md  # any agent
```

More detail in [plugin/README.md](plugin/README.md).

## Use Through MCP

Pagecast can run as a Model Context Protocol server, so MCP-capable agents can
publish, inspect, and revoke through a bounded tool surface. Configure the stdio
server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pagecast": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["pagecast", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

It shares the same user-level Home, Cloudflare credentials, expiry, and
password behavior as `npx pagecast publish`; add `"--data-dir"` only for an
intentionally isolated MCP profile.

| Tool | Purpose | Safety notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | Show Cloudflare/Pagecast connection state. | Redacted by default; `verbose: true` only for trusted local clients. |
| `list_pages` | List known reports and published links. | Redacted by default; `verbose: true` reveals local paths/build settings. |
| `publish_content` | Publish supplied HTML or Markdown content. | Supports `mode: upsert\|new\|update`, `contextId`, `publication`; deterministic upserts need `itemKey`. |
| `publish_file` | Publish a local `.html`/`.htm`/`.md`/`.markdown` file. | Isolates the entry file; sibling assets require `includeAssets: true` **and** `confirmAssets: true`. |
| `revoke_publication` | Take a published token offline and redeploy. | Requires `confirm: true` because it changes a live URL. |

The MCP server is separate from the admin API, which stays loopback-only — do
not expose the admin port to a VPN or shared network. This release supports
local stdio MCP only; an org-hosted HTTP endpoint would need its own auth,
audit, and threat model, and a VPN would gate who can invoke Pagecast, not who
can reach the published URL. Use password protection or your organization's
access layer for restricted recipients.

## Run with Docker

A single image bundles the whole `pagecast` CLI — it serves the admin dashboard
and runs every publish/deploy command.

```sh
# Serve the dashboard (then open http://localhost:4173)
docker compose up --build

# Or run the released image from GHCR
docker pull ghcr.io/amal-david/pagecast:latest
docker run --rm \
  -p 127.0.0.1:4173:4173 -p 127.0.0.1:4174:4174 \
  -v "$PWD/.pagecast:/app/.pagecast" \
  ghcr.io/amal-david/pagecast:latest serve
```

Publishing from a container uses an API token, not the dashboard's OAuth
button. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` with `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
(+ `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`), or run headlessly:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work \
  -e CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN -e CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID \
  ghcr.io/amal-david/pagecast:latest publish ./report.html --json
```

Notes:

- The admin server can run build and publish commands, and its browser-mutation
  checks are not remote-user authentication. Always map both ports to the
  host's **loopback only** (`-p 127.0.0.1:4173:4173`, never bare `-p` mappings).
- On Linux the container runs as uid 1000 (`node`); `mkdir -p .pagecast` before
  `compose up` (or `chown 1000:1000 .pagecast`) avoids bind-mount permission
  errors.
- Wrangler is pinned (see `src/platform.js`) and baked into the image, so
  deploys don't contact npm at runtime.

## Chrome Extension (Experimental)

> ⚠️ Experimental — load-unpacked only, not yet on the Chrome Web Store.

When an agent opens an HTML file as `file:///…/report.html`, the bundled
extension adds a one-click **Publish to Pagecast** button (the server must be
running). Load `extension/` from a source checkout — or the
`pagecast-extension-v<version>.zip` from the [matching release](https://github.com/Amal-David/pagecast/releases) —
via `chrome://extensions` → **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked**, then enable
**"Allow access to file URLs"**. See [extension/README.md](extension/README.md).

## Admin UI Features

- Add `.html`/`.md` files by path or `file:///…` URL, deployable static folders,
  or source folders with a build command and output directory.
- Drag to reorder; publish, re-sync in place, rename links (old links redirect;
  vanity slugs are public drops), or revoke one/all versions.
- Auto-sync path-backed reports; password-protect pages; edit HTML in-app without
  touching the original source file.
- Review interrupted managed operations and retry safe recovery steps.
- View deploy history and remove old snapshots, with one-click "keep newest N" cleanup.

## Security Model

- Admin UI binds to loopback by default, rejects non-loopback Host headers, and
  requires same-origin browser mutations plus a per-process CSRF token;
  no-Origin mutations require the private workspace capability.
- Draft/report HTML is served only by the separate preview origin (port 4174),
  embedded by the admin origin in a sandbox without top-navigation permission.
- The Chrome extension is limited to its session/status/local-publish routes.
- Production access is through active `/p/<slug>/` links; revoked links 404
  after the replacement deploy. Older immutable deployment URLs retain their
  snapshot until pruned.
- Public routes reject directory traversal and hidden files. CLI path publishing
  exposes every regular file under the report's source folder — keep secrets out.
- The Pages root publishes no report listing.

## Telemetry

Pagecast can collect **anonymous** usage stats — command name, Pagecast/Node
version, OS/arch — never file contents, paths, URLs, or Cloudflare
tokens/account IDs. Fresh interactive installs are opt-out with a one-time
disclosure; telemetry is automatically off in CI. Exact fields:
[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

```sh
npx pagecast telemetry status|disable|enable
# env overrides: PAGECAST_TELEMETRY=0|1, DO_NOT_TRACK=1 (always wins)
```

## Development

```sh
npm start                  # run the packaged app from source
npm run check && npm test  # verification suite
npm run build              # rebuild the React admin UI (web/) into public/
```

UI work requires pnpm 10: `pnpm -C web install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts`,
then `pnpm -C web run dev` (proxied to the server on 4173). The root CLI/server
has no runtime npm dependencies. Layout: `src/` (CLI, server, publisher),
`public/` (built UI), `web/` (React source), `plugin/` + `.codex/skills/`
(agent skills), `test/` (Node tests). Source-folder build commands run through
the platform's native shell (`sh -lc` / `%ComSpec%`) — author portable commands.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Fork and branch from `main`, keep the root
CLI/server free of runtime npm dependencies, run `npm run check && npm test`
before opening a PR, and rebuild the admin UI (`npm run build`) if you touched
`web/`. Please **don't** file public issues for security problems — report them
privately via [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
