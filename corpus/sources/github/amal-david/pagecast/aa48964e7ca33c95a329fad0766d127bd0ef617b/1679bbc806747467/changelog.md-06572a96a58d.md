# Changelog

All notable changes to Pagecast are documented here. This project follows
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Unreleased

## 0.7.0 — 2026-08-02

### Added

- **Per-page Open Graph card images** — publishing now renders a 1200×630
  social card from each page's own title and description and deploys it with
  the snapshot, so shared links unfurl with the page's content instead of the
  generic Pagecast card. Rendering happens entirely on your machine (satori +
  resvg WASM — the first runtime dependencies, pure JS/WASM, no native
  binaries) and the card ships to your own Pages project; page content never
  touches a third-party service. Pages that declare their own `og:` meta are
  left untouched, publishes without a usable title fall back to the static
  branded card, and white-label publishes remain image-free.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Skills.sh installation support** — the packaged publishing skill now has a
  one-command install path and agent-readable catalog guidance.
- **Real Settings navigation and Analytics destination** — Settings sidebar
  items open their actual sections, analytics uses the saved configuration, and
  page actions remain available on one row.

### Fixed

- **Activity credential migration** — compatible legacy feedback credentials
  move into Pagecast Home only when both Pages targets use the same Cloudflare
  account.
- **Wrangler D1 provisioning compatibility** — Activity setup retries without
  `--json` when the installed Wrangler version rejects that option.
- **Telemetry command coverage** — ingestion accepts the current CLI's
  background, local URL, setup, and open command classifications while keeping
  unknown command input anonymized.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Pagecast Home** — one user-level Cloudflare subdomain and managed state store
  now owns publications across workspaces; `--data-dir` remains an explicit
  isolated profile and legacy targets remain quarantined until chosen.
- **Agent-context upserts** — CLI and MCP publishing update the same item in the
  same hashed agent context, with `--new-link`, `--update`, and created/updated
  JSON results.
- **Main-canvas Cloudflare onboarding** — resumable Wrangler authorization jobs,
  Home subdomain confirmation, scope explanation, account selection, and retry
  live outside Settings.
- **Privacy-preserving Activity** — D1 access events, anonymous HMAC visitors,
  30-day detailed retention, legacy KV-total migration, per-link summaries, and
  Home-wide Activity. Analytics and reactions are independently enabled.

### Changed

- Explicit “Publish this as a Pagecast” instructions are sufficient consent and
  packaged skills execute them immediately; proactive suggestions still ask.
- Interactive unauthenticated publishes start Wrangler login and resume the
  original operation. Non-interactive runs fail structurally.
- **Anonymous CLI telemetry default** — fresh installs now enable
  the existing allowlisted telemetry by default and show a disclosure. Users can
  opt out with `pagecast telemetry disable`, `PAGECAST_TELEMETRY=0`, or
  `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`; CI remains disabled unless explicitly enabled.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-07-10

### Added

- **Separate preview trust boundary** — report HTML now comes from the local
  public/preview origin, never the admin origin. Admin redirects old
  `/preview/...` requests and embeds previews with a restrictive iframe sandbox.
- **Authenticated local mutations** — browser writes require an allowed Origin
  and current admin-session token; every no-Origin write uses the private
  workspace capability; the Chrome extension is limited to its three adapter
  routes. Non-loopback binds are rejected, with an explicit wildcard exception
  only for the packaged loopback-mapped Docker proxy.
- **Project-scoped publication state** — Cloudflare identity is the account ID
  plus project name. Snapshots, redirects, protection manifests, and deployment
  staging are isolated by that identity and carry a Pagecast ownership marker.
- **Single-writer recovery** — a workspace lease, private runtime descriptor,
  atomic local state writes, and durable cross-system operation journal prevent
  concurrent CLI/MCP/server mutations from silently losing updates and keep
  incomplete Cloudflare reconciliation visible and retryable.
- **Stronger new unlisted URLs** — newly generated unlisted and protected slugs
  combine a memorable prefix with 128 bits of opaque capability entropy. Short
  drops and every existing word-only URL keep their previous behavior.
- **Cross-platform and release proofs** — CI now covers Node 20/22 on Linux and
  Windows, plus committed UI bundle, package, and Docker checks on Linux.

### Changed

- **Explicit target adoption** — unrelated existing Cloudflare projects are not
  silently managed. Legacy links without a recorded account/project stay
  readable and require **Attach selected project** before sync, rename, expiry,
  or revoke.
- **Direct deploy separation** — `pagecast pages deploy` uses target/branch-scoped
  staging and never changes the managed `/p/...` publication selection. It still
  replaces the named Pages project's contents.
- **Telemetry consent** — genuinely fresh installs send no telemetry until
  `pagecast telemetry enable`. Existing persisted choices and explicit
  environment overrides remain compatible.
- **Actual Cloudflare origin** — published URLs and social metadata use the
  production origin returned by deployment rather than assuming a project-name
  hostname.
- **Explicit vanity-link semantics** — custom slugs without the 128-bit
  capability suffix, including the goal URL, are recorded as public drops;
  existing word-only links retain their legacy classification and URL.
- **Native build shell** — source-folder commands use `sh -lc` on POSIX and
  `%ComSpec% /d /s /c` on Windows. Command syntax itself is still
  platform-specific.
- **Pinned publisher toolchain** — native and Docker publishing share the exact
  Wrangler `4.86.0` pin from `src/platform.js`; an exact-version override is
  available only for tests and deliberate local compatibility work.
- **Package boundary and versions** — the root export now has an explicit
  compatibility-preserving `src/index.js` boundary. npm package, Chrome
  extension, Codex skill, and Claude plugin metadata are aligned at `0.5.0`.

### Upgrade notes

- Restart any v0.4 background process once so v0.5 can own the workspace lease
  and authenticated command descriptor. Reload/update the bundled extension at
  the same time; old extension code cannot complete the new CSRF handshake.
- Existing URLs and persisted state are not rotated. For unattributed legacy
  links, select the original Cloudflare project and explicitly attach each link
  before attempting a mutation.
- A repository administrator must enable the new CI jobs as required `main`
  checks after merge; branch-protection settings cannot be changed by this PR.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-08

### Added

- **MCP server support** — `pagecast mcp` now runs a local stdio Model Context
  Protocol server with tools for status, page listing, content/file publishing,
  and publication revocation. (#16)
- **Agent-safe publishing defaults** — MCP `publish_content` writes supplied
  HTML/Markdown into isolated Pagecast storage, while `publish_file` excludes
  sibling assets unless both `includeAssets` and `confirmAssets` are set. (#16)
- **MCP documentation** — README now includes MCP client configuration, tool
  behavior, example arguments, and the current org/VPN deployment boundary.

### Fixed

- **Stdio response ordering** — MCP requests received together are handled
  serially so clients see responses in request order. (#16)

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Cloudflare sync-back** — import existing published Pages links into the
  dashboard, including pages created outside the current local workspace. (#15)
- **Preview workbench** — selected pages now show an embedded desktop/mobile
  preview with centered controls and a denser operator layout. (#15)
- **Persistent local URL** — macOS users can install `http://pagecast.localhost`
  and a login service so Pagecast can stay reachable after restart without a
  visible port. (#15)
- **Release automation** — GitHub releases now publish the npm package, push a
  GHCR Docker image, and attach a packaged Chrome extension zip.

### Fixed

- **Saved edits publish in place** — editing an already-published page now syncs
  the existing public URL instead of only saving a local draft. (#15)
- **Portless URL safety** — Pagecast falls back to the actual admin URL when the
  installed macOS redirect points at a different active port. (#15)

## 0.2.0 — 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Memorable links** — published pages now get human-readable word-slugs
  (e.g. `/p/hollow-paperclip/`) instead of a random token tail. This legacy
  unlisted URL shape remains supported. (#10)
- **Advanced publish settings** — a "Publish as a drop" toggle in the admin UI
  mints a short, shareable (guessable) link; the default stayed a longer
  unlisted word-only link. (#11)
- **Docker support** — a single image runs the dashboard *and* every
  publish/deploy command. Ships a Dockerfile, Compose file, and headless CLI
  usage with a scoped `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`. (#9)
- **Deploy history** — view and remove old whole-site Cloudflare Pages
  deployment snapshots from the admin UI (**Settings → Deploy history**) or the
  terminal: `pagecast pages deployments list|delete|prune`. (#6)
- **Anonymous usage telemetry (originally opt-out)** — reports only the command name,
  pagecast/Node version, and OS/arch; never file contents, paths, published
  URLs, or Cloudflare tokens. Off in CI by default; disable with
  `pagecast telemetry disable`, `PAGECAST_TELEMETRY=0`, or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`. (#12)

### Fixed

- **Windows compatibility** — spawn `npx` via the shell and accept Windows-style
  paths so publish and deploy work on Windows. (#8)

## 0.1.6

- **Expiring URLs** — edge-enforced link expiry (default 30d, configurable via
  `--expires <7d|12h|never>`), enforced by a generated Cloudflare Pages
  Function. (#5)
