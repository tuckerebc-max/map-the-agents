# GitHub Actions Setup for Automated Build & Release

This document explains how to set up the required secrets and Apple Developer
credentials for automated macOS app building, code signing, and notarization.

## Prerequisites

You need:
- An [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) membership ($99/year)
- A **Developer ID Application** certificate (for signing apps distributed outside the App Store)
- Access to the GitHub repository settings

## Required GitHub Secrets

Go to your repository **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** and add
these 7 secrets:

### 1. `DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION` — Signing certificate (base64)

The Developer ID Application certificate exported as a .p12 file, then
base64-encoded.

**How to create it:**

1. Open **Keychain Access** on your Mac
2. Find your "Developer ID Application" certificate (under "My Certificates")
   - If you don't have one, create it at
     [developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates)
     → click **+** → choose **Developer ID Application**
3. Right-click the certificate → **Export** → save as `.p12` → set a password
4. Base64-encode and copy to clipboard:
   ```bash
   base64 -i DeveloperID_Application.p12 | pbcopy
   ```
5. Paste as the secret value

### 2. `DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION_PASSWORD` — Certificate password

The password you set when exporting the .p12 file in step 3 above.

### 3. `DEVELOPER_ID_NAME` — Signing identity name

The full name of your Developer ID certificate as used by `codesign`.

**How to find it:**
```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

It looks like:
```
"Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)"
```

Copy the full quoted string (without the quotes) as the secret value.

### 4. `APPLE_ID` — Apple ID for notarization

Your Apple ID email address. This is the account that will submit builds to
Apple's notary service.

### 5. `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD` — App-specific password

An app-specific password for your Apple ID. This is **not** your regular Apple
ID password.

**How to create it:**

1. Go to [account.apple.com](https://account.apple.com)
2. Sign in → **Sign-In and Security** → **App-Specific Passwords**
3. Click **+** to generate a new password
4. Name it something like "GitHub Actions Fantastty"
5. Copy the generated password as the secret value

### 6. `APPLE_TEAM_ID` — Apple Developer Team ID

Your 10-character Apple Developer Team ID.

**How to find it:**
- Go to [developer.apple.com/account](https://developer.apple.com/account) → **Membership details**
- Or run:
  ```bash
  security find-identity -v -p codesigning | grep "Developer ID"
  ```
  The team ID is the string in parentheses at the end.

### 7. `SPARKLE_EDDSA_PRIVATE_KEY` — Sparkle update signing key

The private EdDSA key used by Sparkle to sign update archives in the appcast.
This is separate from the Apple Developer ID certificate. The matching public
key is committed in `Fantastty/Info.plist` as `SUPublicEDKey`.

**How to create it:**

1. Download the Sparkle distribution that matches `project.yml`
2. Generate a Fantastty-specific key:
   ```bash
   ./bin/generate_keys --account com.blainecook.fantastty
   ```
3. Export the private key:
   ```bash
   ./bin/generate_keys --account com.blainecook.fantastty -x fantastty-sparkle-private-key.txt
   ```
4. Paste the file contents as the `SPARKLE_EDDSA_PRIVATE_KEY` secret.
5. Keep the private key file somewhere secure, then remove local scratch copies.

## How It Works

### Triggers

| Event | What happens |
|---|---|
| Push to `main` | Build, sign, notarize, upload artifact |
| Push tag `v*` | Build, sign, notarize, create GitHub Release with DMG and Sparkle appcast |
| Manual dispatch | Build, sign, notarize, upload artifact (optional version override) |

### Build Steps

1. Check out code with Ghostty submodule
2. Install Zig and build GhosttyKit xcframework (cached between runs)
3. Import signing certificate into a temporary keychain
4. Build the app with `xcodebuild` using the Developer ID certificate
5. Create a DMG with Applications symlink
6. Sign and notarize the DMG with Apple
7. For tagged releases: generate `appcast.xml` with Sparkle's EdDSA signature
8. Upload the DMG as a build artifact
9. For tagged releases: create a GitHub Release with the DMG and appcast attached

Fantastty's `SUFeedURL` points at:

```text
https://github.com/blaine/fantastty/releases/latest/download/appcast.xml
```

The appcast points each update at that release's versioned DMG asset.

### Releasing a New Version

```bash
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

GitHub Actions will build, sign, notarize, and publish a release automatically.

### Manual Builds

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select **Build and Release**
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Optionally enter a version number
5. Click **Run workflow**

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

- **"No identity found"** — Certificate not imported correctly. Verify
  `DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION` is valid base64 and the password is correct.
- **"User interaction is not allowed"** — Keychain partition list not set.
  This should be handled by the workflow, but check the signing step logs.
- **"Notarization failed"** — Check `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD`, and
  `APPLE_TEAM_ID`. The app-specific password may have expired.
- **xcframework build fails** — Zig version mismatch. Check
  `vendor/ghostty/build.zig.zon` for the required `minimum_zig_version` and
  update the workflow's Zig version accordingly.

### Debug commands

```bash
# List signing identities on your Mac
security find-identity -v -p codesigning

# Verify an app's signature
codesign --verify --deep --strict Fantastty.app
codesign -dvv Fantastty.app

# Check Gatekeeper status
spctl --assess --verbose Fantastty.app

# Check notarization history
xcrun notarytool history \
  --apple-id YOUR_APPLE_ID \
  --password YOUR_APP_PASSWORD \
  --team-id YOUR_TEAM_ID
```

## Security Notes

- Certificates are stored as encrypted GitHub secrets — never committed to the repo
- The Sparkle private key is stored as a GitHub secret — never committed to the repo
- A temporary keychain is created per build and destroyed afterward
- App-specific passwords have limited scope (they can't access your full Apple account)
- Only `codesign` and `security` are granted keychain access
