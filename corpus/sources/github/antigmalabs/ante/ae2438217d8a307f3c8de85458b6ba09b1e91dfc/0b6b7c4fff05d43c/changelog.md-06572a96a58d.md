# Changelog

## v0.2.4 - 2026-09-22

### Added
- GPT-6 Sol and Luna (OpenAI and OpenRouter), Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic, subscription presets, and OpenRouter), Grok 4.7, and MiMo 2.6 Pro/Flash in the built-in model catalogs
- `ante update` prints a message when no newer version is available

### Changed
- Offline engine updated to llama.cpp b11046; the removed `--mlock`, `--mmap`/`--no-mmap`, and DirectIO loading flags are rejected with guidance
- Restored the muted spinner and amber tool indicators in the TUI
- TUI modal state refactor: every modal is held as a value in the modal state

### Fixed
- Shared high-detail images are capped at 2000px

### Crates
- Public crates published as 0.2.4: ante-protocol-shape, ante-llm, ante-exec, ante-sdk

## v0.2.3 - 2026-09-21

### Added
- Bare `ante --resume` opens the interactive session picker directly without requiring a session ID or creating a throwaway session
- First-class `System` message role for runtime instructions, serializing natively to Anthropic system and OpenAI developer messages with fallback to system reminders

### Changed
- Preserve subagent deliverables in parent handoffs by returning final task answers directly instead of requesting an extra synthetic summary turn
- Clarify context compaction marker to state that earlier history remains for reference while the model sees only the summary
- Working spinner remains visible continuously throughout active turns (streaming, thinking, and tool execution)
- Active background jobs are highlighted with the theme accent and display without obstructing scrollback
- AskUser accepts single-option questions to avoid unnecessary retries, and surfaces tool errors visibly in chat
- TUI performance and state ownership optimizations: cached row span allocation reductions, single-fact settings ownership in `AppState`, and git branch re-reading only at turn and tool boundaries

### Wire
- `Evt::TaskEnd` event added to notify clients of structured job and background task completions

### Crates
- Public crates published as 0.2.3: ante-protocol-shape, ante-llm, ante-exec, ante-sdk

## v0.2.2 - 2026-09-20

### Added
- `max_concurrent_subagents` setting in `settings.json` to cap parallel Agent calls
- NVIDIA Nemotron (3.5 Lightning, 3 Ultra) and OpenRouter models (GPT-6 Astra, Astra Pro, Qwen 3.8 Flash)
- Ctrl+Shift+V shortcut for clipboard image paste in the composer
- Show Bash descriptions as headlines with command preview and elapsed time

### Changed
- `ante gateway` delegates to the external `ante-gateway` executable
- `ante rage` excludes gateway channel configuration
- TUI architecture and rendering refactors: ChatState state ownership, pure pager frames, first-fit text wrapping, and unified row types
- Show shell commands immediately upon invocation
- Stable TUI spinner with delayed elapsed time display
- Diff views omit unchanged-line indicator rows
- Refined task completion, delegation, and length guidance in system prompts
- Model catalog cleanup: removed obsolete DeepSeek Flash and OpenRouter Opus routes

### Fixed
- Session resume re-renders the complete event log instead of capping at 200 events
- User image and PDF attachments are preserved in Responses wire serialization
- Queued messages return to the composer when replacing a session
- Strip ANSI escapes from external tool and shell output to avoid wrap clipping
- Soft-wrapped notices and shell output rejoin properly when copied

### Removed
- Removed `ante_sdk::claude` and legacy child-process stdio transport; host stdio connections remain supported via `connect(Endpoint::Stdio, options)`

### Crates
- Public crates published as 0.2.2: ante-protocol-shape, ante-llm, ante-exec, ante-sdk

## v0.2.1 - 2026-09-19

### Added
- DeepSeek V4.1 Flash in the Antix catalog (`deepseek-flash`), with native vision support and reasoning effort controls
- Fallback lookup for Cargo-installed external `ante-*` commands when `~/.cargo/bin` is missing from `PATH`

### Changed
- `TodoWrite` is now opt-in via `--include-tools TodoWrite`; default TUI sessions omit the pinned task list
- `ante gateway` connects to a running Ante host (`ante serve --sock` or `--connect`) via the SDK rather than managing an in-process runtime
- TUI working spinner delays appearance until three seconds into a turn, eliminating unnecessary animations on quick replies
- Removed the built-in `ali-coding-plan` preset; users can configure it as a custom provider
- Dependency updates

### Fixed
- Images are filtered out before sending to models that do not support vision, preventing API errors without altering saved history
- Fullscreen TUI mode supports Shift+Enter for newline insertion in terminals with Kitty keyboard protocol support
- Compaction summaries stream through the standard provider transport, inheriting the same timeout and error handling as regular turns
- Provider credit exhaustion errors (HTTP 429) are classified as quota limits rather than transient rate limits, preventing minute-long retry loops
- Bash commands receive the calling session ID in `ANTE_SESSION` instead of inheriting stale parent process values
- Discord gateway replies route back to the original conversation without requiring explicit bot re-mentions

### Crates
- Public crates published as 0.2.1: ante-protocol-shape, ante-llm, ante-exec, ante-sdk

## v0.2.0 - 2026-09-17

First numbered release, closing the `v0.preview.N` series. From now on, patch releases within a minor series stay compatible; intentional breaking changes move to a new minor series with migration notes.

### Added
- AskUser tool: the model can ask one to four structured multiple-choice questions mid-turn. The TUI shows them in place of the composer, with option previews, free-text notes, and multi-select; Enter takes the recommended option, Esc skips so the model proceeds on its own judgment, and "Chat about this" returns to conversation. The gateway renders questions as numbered options. Unattended sessions never pause, and subagents do not get the tool
- GPT-6 Astra in the OpenAI subscription provider, now its default model (272K context, image input); GPT-5.5, GPT-5.4, and GPT-5.4 Mini are removed from the subscription picker
- `ante-sdk` connects to `ante serve --ws` over `ws://` (loopback hosts only) or `wss://` (opt-in `wss` feature), passing a bearer token

### Changed
- `ante serve --ws` requires a bearer token from `ANTE_SERVE_TOKEN` and refuses to start without one; clients must send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, missing or wrong tokens are refused with `401`, and handshakes time out after 10 seconds
- Disposable storage moved out of Ante home: WebFetch overflow goes to the OS cache directory (macOS `~/Library/Caches`, Linux `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, Windows `LOCALAPPDATA`), and intermediate downloads use the OS temp directory
- `ante rage` writes the finished report to `--output` (default: the working directory) in both compressed and uncompressed formats, never overwrites existing output, and falls back to an `.uncompressed` directory if compression fails
- Agent autocomplete in the TUI inserts quoted mentions (`@"name (agent)"`) instead of `@agent-name`

### Fixed
- Resumed sessions use the current permission settings instead of the saved mode, so a session saved in Yolo no longer overrides Strict settings. Older snapshots still load; their saved mode is ignored and dropped on the next save
- The running-tool row wraps long shell commands over up to three rows with a `… (+N chars)` marker instead of cutting them off at the terminal edge

### Wire
- `TurnPauseReason::Question { tool_use_id, questions }` pauses a turn for AskUser; clients resolve it with `Op::QuestionResponse { turn_id, tool_use_id, reply }`, where `reply` is `Answered`, `Dismissed`, or `Discuss { message? }`. New payload types: `QuestionSpec`, `QuestionOption`, `QuestionAnswer`, `QuestionReply`

### Crates
- Public crates published as 0.2.0: ante-protocol-shape, ante-llm, ante-exec, ante-sdk

## v0.preview.99 - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Background job completion notifications: background task exits re-enter the session at the model's next step boundary or turn start as a notifications block, removing the need for manual status polling or long wait windows
- Subscription quota display in `/usage`: shows current session and weekly usage limit bars with reset times for Anthropic and ChatGPT subscriptions
- Per-call model override for the Agent tool: subtasks can specify an individual `model` parameter, falling back to the agent definition or current session model

### Changed
- TUI theme overhaul: migrated all color call sites to a structured token table and refreshed Light mode to match the designer's palette (with matching syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks)
- Model narration styling: intermediate model thoughts and narration preceding tool calls render in a muted tone, keeping the bright text tone for final answers
- Inline Edit previews: completed edit results now use a 32-row inline budget that preserves complete diff hunks in file order, with remaining changes summarized and accessible in full via Ctrl+O
- Unified version validation and upgrade checks in release automation in preparation for numbered SemVer releases

### Fixed
- Permission grants are now recorded only after tool approvals are accepted by the scheduler, preventing stale or denied approval responses from granting session permissions
- Switching to fullscreen mode in the TUI now properly clears inline presenter caches and measures through the active presenter, avoiding duplicate cached entries and layout glitches
- RGB theme colors are quantized to the 256-color ANSI palette on terminals without truecolor support

## v0.preview.98 - 2026-09-11

### Added
- Configurable provider `thinking_display` (`off`, `concise`, `detailed`) in the catalog spec to request readable reasoning summaries, with built-in presets defaulting to `detailed` and support across OpenAI Responses, Anthropic, and Gemini
- DeepSeek V4.1 Flash in DeepSeek and OpenRouter catalogs, with vision support, 384,000-token output limits, and maximum reasoning effort
- `--include-skills` and `--exclude-skills` CLI flags override skill filters for a session without modifying saved settings

### Changed
- Subagent token and cache usage is forwarded to the parent session so turn usage totals include delegated work; child context snapshots remain private, preserving the root context reading in the TUI
- Removed DeepSeek V4 Pro presets from DeepSeek, Antix, and OpenRouter catalogs
- Dependency updates: indexmap to 2.14.2, rmcp to 3.2.0

### Fixed
- Stream idle timeouts measure silence directly at transport reads instead of waiting for usable output, preventing timeouts during keepalives, lifecycle events, or slow tool-call argument streaming

### Wire
- `SessionRequest` adds optional `include_skills` and `exclude_skills` fields to override skill filters
- `Evt::UsageUpdate` context snapshot is omitted (`None`) on subagent usage updates

## v0.preview.97 - 2026-09-10

### Added
- Fullscreen chat render mode for terminals that drop inline scrollback (Windows consoles and similar): set `ui.render_mode = "fullscreen"` or toggle the **Render mode** row in `/config`. The chat runs on the alternate screen with PgUp/PgDn and mouse-wheel scrolling, drag-to-select copy, and the Ctrl+O, diff pager, and resume overlays return to the chat on close. Inline mode remains the default and is unchanged
- `--fullscreen` flag starts a single run in fullscreen render mode without persisting the setting

### Changed
- Pinned llama.cpp for offline inference bumped from `b10612` to `b10826`, which includes the CUDA mmid/mmf race fix; the platform compatibility matrix is unchanged
- The Ctrl+O transcript and diff pager scroll three lines per mouse-wheel notch instead of one, so physical mouse wheels can move long transcripts

### Fixed
- Consecutive streamed replies no longer disappear from terminal scrollback in xterm.js-based terminals: the inline renderer scrolls with linefeeds at the bottom margin instead of partial-region scroll sequences
- `ToolEnd` is emitted as each tool call finishes instead of after the whole concurrent batch settles, so a fast call no longer shows `still working` beside a slow sibling. Every terminal outcome (denied, cancelled, malformed) reports through one path, and a cancellation is never overwritten by a late task result
- Tool calls denied, cancelled, or rejected before execution now appear in the TUI and headless output instead of arriving as a result with no matching entry
- The blank spacer line between consecutive tool cells is kept when a running tool's `still working` row appears
- Scrolling a pager back to the bottom re-pins it so new content follows again (also affected the Ctrl+O overlay)
- JSONL and WebSocket transports keep reading control operations while an output write is stalled, so `Interrupt` and `Shutdown` are not stuck behind a slow peer. Each write has a 30-second deadline, and reply-queue overflow disconnects the peer instead of blocking input

### Wire
- `Evt::ToolEnd` adds a `tool_name` field, populated even when execution never started; older events without the field still deserialize with an empty name

## v0.preview.96 - 2026-09-09

### Added
- GPT-6 Astra, GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna in the Antix catalog, with 1,050,000-token context windows, 128,000-token output limits, vision support, and reasoning effort controls
- Restored Gemini 3.7 Flash and Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview alongside Gemini 3.8 Flash in the Antix catalog

### Changed
- Subagents run under the Auto permission mode with an unattended policy rather than bypassing all permissions: destructive commands like `rm -rf` are denied at admission, while safe tools run without prompting
- Unattended sessions deny tool calls that require approval at admission instead of pausing the turn on an unanswerable prompt. Headless sessions default to unattended and honor explicit `--permission-mode` flags rather than forcing Yolo mode
- Managed offline inference standardizes on `llama serve` for launches across all platforms, and existing saved `llama-server` paths automatically resolve to `llama`
- Offline state reporting uses lifecycle snapshots instead of an overlapping presentation event stream, and model settings (context length, temperature, reasoning budget) are resolved once against presets and published to the catalog
- Claude Fable 5.1 default reasoning effort on Antix aligns to `high` per upstream documentation

### Fixed
- Session actor failures (panics or aborts) during teardown are reported through `Host::close` instead of being silently discarded
- Z.ai exhausted-balance errors (HTTP 429 with error code 1113) are classified as terminal quota errors instead of being retried as transient rate limits

### Wire
- `SessionRequest` and `Op::ResumeSession` add an optional `unattended` field indicating that approval prompts cannot be answered and should be denied immediately at admission

## v0.preview.95 - 2026-09-08

### Added
- GPT-6 Astra in the OpenAI API catalog, supporting reasoning efforts from `low` through `max`
- `ante serve` accepts concurrent client connections over `--sock` and `--ws`, running each peer in its own task so handshakes do not block other connections, while client shutdowns end only the calling connection

### Changed
- Offline inference uses llama.cpp router mode behind a shared runtime across CLI, TUI, and startup callers. Model switches no longer restart the server process, load and unload track native progress events, and workers are cleaned up reliably on cancellation, stop, or exit
- Gemini 3.8 Flash replaces older Gemini Flash and Pro entries across Gemini API, Vertex AI, OpenRouter, and Antix (supporting low/medium/high reasoning effort) as the default Gemini model; Gemini 3.5 Flash Lite is retained as the Feather option on Gemini API and Vertex AI
- All built-in tools ignore unknown argument fields instead of rejecting the call, preventing errors from model envelope wrappers or flag aliases, and tool error messages format cause chains onto a single line without backtrace noise
- Protocol event channels and `crates/ante-sdk`'s `EventReceiver` are now unbounded, warning on backlog rather than dropping events under heavy streaming bursts

### Fixed
- Compaction aligns fold input boundaries to conversation steps so a `tool_result` is never included without its preceding `tool_use`, preventing invalid request errors and persistent compaction failures on tool-dense dialogs
- The TUI dead-reckons cursor positions locally when a terminal does not answer cursor position queries (`CSI 6n`), preventing startup and resize crashes on CPR-dead terminals

## v0.preview.94 - 2026-09-03

### Added
- Project-level settings: an `.ante/settings.json` in the nearest ancestor of the session directory layers over your user settings when a session starts. Because it is repository content, it may pin or narrow only — `permission_mode`, `permissions.allow`, `mcp_servers`, `system_prompt`, `model` and `provider` are dropped with a notice. `ante doctor` shows a `project` row, and `ante rage` includes the file redacted
- `ante serve --sock [PATH]` hosts Ante on a Unix socket (default `run/serve.sock` in the ante home). Ownership is an exclusive lock on a `.lock` sibling, so a second host refuses to start and leaves the live socket alone, while a stale socket file is replaced. One client's `Shutdown` ends only its own connection; the process exits on SIGINT or SIGTERM
- `crates/ante-sdk` — the Ante client for external programs: `connect(endpoint, options)` with the endpoint grammar `stdio` | `unix:<path>` | `ws://<addr>`, yielding the same `Client` on every path. `stdio` spawns `ante serve --stdio` as its own child; `ws://` is not connectable yet
- Sessions can carry a title: `/rename <title>` sets it, bare `/rename` clears it. The title shows in the resume picker instead of the first message, follows into the terminal tab, and survives a resume
- Claude Fable 5.1 replaces Fable 5 across the Anthropic, Anthropic subscription, Antix, and OpenRouter catalogs
- Gemini 3.8 Flash on the Gemini API, Vertex AI, and OpenRouter, with Gemini 3.7/3.8's exact low/medium/high reasoning ladder; Muse Spark 1.3 replaces 1.2 on OpenRouter

### Fixed
- The TUI reserves the spinner, tip, and todo rows in one height calculation, fixing the pinned layout and the archive gap during an active turn

### Wire
- `SessionRequest`, `SessionUpdate` and `SessionInfo` gain an optional `title` (omitted when unset); `SessionUpdate { title: "" }` clears it
- `SessionInitialized` is renamed `SessionInfo` — a Rust type name only, the JSON is unchanged

### Changed
- Dependency updates

## v0.preview.93 - 2026-09-02

### Changed
- Tool activity in the TUI shows project-relative paths (or `~` for other home-directory paths), labels completed shell commands as `Ran`, and keeps header punctuation visually neutral
- Compaction learns a provider's actual context window after an overflow, scales summaries and anchors to fit, and retries once instead of walking a shrinking retry ladder

### Fixed
- Parallel tool results share one context cap, preventing oversized batches from entering a repeated clear-and-rerun loop; cleared-result markers now identify the original tool call
- Buffered provider requests stop at the configured idle timeout instead of potentially hanging until the connection fails
- A second Cerebras turn after reasoning and tool use no longer fails because replayed `reasoning_content` is unsupported
- Goal evaluation and compaction retry once without `tool_choice` when an OpenAI-compatible provider rejects that parameter
- OpenCode zen usage-window errors are classified as terminal quota errors instead of being retried as transient rate limits

### Wire
- `SessionInitialized` adds `skills` and `subagents`, so `SessionStart` and `SessionUpdated` announce the capabilities equipped for the session; both fields default to empty when absent

## v0.preview.92 - 2026-08-31

### Added
- `/add-provider` — a bundled skill that walks you through adding a custom OpenAI-compatible provider: it discovers the endpoint's models, probes which reasoning effort levels it accepts, and writes the entry into `~/.ante/catalog.json`
- `catalog.json` can declare which reasoning effort levels a model supports, so a custom endpoint shows its real ladder instead of one guessed from the model's name

### Changed
- Grep and Glob page correctly: a page is cut at a whole entry and the "more results" marker points at the cut. Grep previously dropped results past its character limit while claiming there were more. Glob is now paginated too, returns partial results when it times out, and both tools list files in path order
- File search in the TUI is much faster on large projects, and no longer hides files nested more than six levels deep
- Resuming a long session is faster
- Reasoning effort is consistent everywhere — the selector, the session, and the provider all agree on the level you picked
- Compaction skips a fold that cannot free any space, instead of repeatedly compacting to no effect on small context windows
- Large tool results reach you and the model whole, instead of being replaced by a "trimmed, please retry" error that forced tools to be re-run one at a time
- A slow or huge error page from WebFetch no longer eats the whole request timeout

### Fixed
- Anthropic subscription sign-in works again against Anthropic's current OAuth endpoints, and verifies it was granted inference access before reporting a connection
- Headless `--resume` no longer fails to start when the provider comes from the saved session, and keeps its memory setting
- `/offline-mode` no longer crashes the TUI on terminals shorter than 12 rows

### Wire
- `Op::StartSession`'s payload is renamed `SessionOverrides` → `SessionRequest`. Field names are unchanged, but an unset field now means "use the host's default" rather than "leave unchanged"
- `ModelSpec.effort_options` is replaced by `supported_efforts`. Clients that read the effort ladder need a coordinated bump

## v0.preview.91 - 2026-08-30

### Added
- Anthropic `xhigh` reasoning effort — available on Claude Sonnet 5 and Opus 5, Opus 4.7/4.8, and always on Fable/Mythos 5; Opus/Sonnet 4.6 keep their four-level adaptive ladder
- `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.4-nano`, and `glm-5.3-flash` in the Antix catalog
- Completed reasoning blocks show how long the model thought — `Thought for <duration>`, derived from protocol event timestamps so replays report the same number

### Changed
- Compaction tuning: manual `/compact` folds more history than automatic compaction, so running it twice in a row no longer re-folds a fresh summary; an overflow retry stops once it stops making progress instead of spending more provider calls; and a single oversized tool result is trimmed rather than costing a rejected request
- GLM 5.3 defaults to max reasoning effort when an OpenAI-compatible profile supplies no effort, and Anthropic stream errors carrying the `invalid_request` provider alias are classified instead of surfacing raw
- Telemetry uses the standard `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variables

### Fixed
- Markdown link URLs render in the design steel blue instead of hardcoded ANSI blue, which was nearly unreadable on dark backgrounds

## v0.preview.90 - 2026-08-27

### Added
- `/compact` accepts instructions that steer the handoff summary — `/compact focus on the API changes` passes trailing arguments into the fold prompt

### Changed
- Redesigned compaction: one reducer with graded decay — aged tool results are evicted before anything is summarized, the newest slice of the dialog and your own messages survive verbatim, and the summary covers only what the model can no longer see. Compaction is decided at one point in the turn instead of several, so it is more consistent and no longer costs the model its working state
- Bash results lead with the exit status as plain text instead of JSON-escaped output: stdout and stderr stay separate, empty sections are omitted, background handles are named, and signal-terminated jobs report the shell's `128 + signal` convention
- The offline llama engine tracks the official llama.app artifact matrices, pinned at `b10612` (was `b10217`): curated ARM and x86 CPU/Vulkan feature tiers with the strongest compatible tier selected at install time, CUDA-first GPU selection with Vulkan fallback, and every mirrored artifact dependency-audited before upload
- Dependency updates

### Wire
- `Op::Compact` changes from a unit variant to a struct variant carrying optional `instructions`. External clients on the old shape (sending bare `"Compact"`) need a coordinated bump

## v0.preview.89 - 2026-08-26

### Added
- GLM 5.3 Flash on Z.ai (`glm-5.3-flash`) and OpenRouter (`z-ai/glm-5.3-flash`), with multimodal input, a 1M context window, and graded low/high/max reasoning effort; GLM 5.3 remains the default Z.ai model

### Changed
- Run arguments supplied alongside a subcommand are now rejected instead of silently ignored (`ante --model X catalog` errors)
- Tool filters take one value per occurrence — `--tools Read,Write` or a repeated flag; space-separated lists now error, and `--allowed-tools` is removed in favor of `--tools`
- `--profile` is process-scoped: it rides before or after any subcommand, and `serve`, `gateway`, `doctor`, `update`, `rage`, and external apps honor it instead of reading default settings; an unknown profile name falls back to `settings.json` rather than creating one
- WebFetch drops its unused `prompt` argument — Ante has no extraction sub-model, so the interface is URL-only

### Fixed
- WebFetch identifies itself with an `ante/<version>` User-Agent — GitHub's API rejects UA-less requests with an opaque 403 — and a failed request now carries up to 2KB of the response body instead of a bare status line
- `ante serve` handles a client that closes stdout as a logged disconnect instead of hanging, stops reading stdin after an explicit `Shutdown`, and bounds runtime teardown

## v0.preview.88 - 2026-08-25

### Added
- `ante <name>` runs an external `ante-<name>` executable, resolved from `~/.ante/bin` then `$PATH`; built-in subcommands always take precedence, and an unrecognized name still gets a did-you-mean suggestion
- Antix OAuth catalog refresh: Gemini 3.7 Flash, Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Opus 5, and GLM 5.3 replace Gemini 3.5 Flash, Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.8, and GLM 5.2

### Changed
- `ante --help` and usage errors no longer create a log file or boot telemetry — the CLI now parses before the async runtime, logging, and crash hook are initialized
- The bundled `skill-creator` skill is model-invocable only and no longer appears as a user-facing command

### Fixed
- The "no provider is configured" error names the credential environment variables Ante actually reads and points at `ante auth login` and offline mode
- A terminal that never answers the cursor-position query now explains that the inline UI query went unanswered and suggests launching outside the current wrapper or multiplexer, instead of reporting a bare crossterm timeout
- MCP tool schemas no longer carry `pattern` onto the wire, so an unsupported regex construct (such as lookaround) in one server's schema can no longer make a provider reject the entire tool set; non-regex guidance like `format: email` is preserved

## v0.preview.87 - 2026-08-23

### Added
- GLM 5.3 on Z.ai and OpenRouter, with graded low/high/max reasoning effort (Antix keeps GLM 5.2 until its catalog exposes 5.3)
- `/models <model_id>` selects a model directly on the current provider, including IDs not in the catalog listing
- Denying a tool call can carry a feedback message: the reason reaches the model as the failed tool result and is shown in the transcript under the decision line
- `/term` opens a native split inside Ghostty 1.3+

### Changed
- Successful file reads render as a compact one-liner (`Read (path) ·110 lines`) and failed calls carry a red `Failed` suffix with the error as a dim child row; grouped runs list reads and failures per call instead of folding them into the neutral counts summary
- The default status line renders `model(effort)` and `cwd(⑂ branch)` as compound items, with the same independent `/statusline` toggles
- Markdown blockquotes use the muted theme foreground instead of bright green, so quoted lines read as asides
- The chat input, diff approval, credential entry, and model settings share an in-house grapheme-aware text buffer; combining marks, skin tones, ZWJ emoji, and wide glyphs now wrap and move the cursor correctly (removes the `tui-input`, `ratatui-macros`, and `critical-section` dependencies)

### Fixed
- A mid-turn compaction (context-overflow retry) no longer ends the turn by printing the summary as the answer — the summary is re-entered as a user-role continuation so the model resumes the task
- Launching the TUI with a redirected stdout fails fast with an actionable message instead of hanging two seconds and dying with a cursor-position error
- A persistently empty provider response fails the turn after three retries instead of resubmitting the same prompt up to the step limit, and tool calls whose stream never delivered a name are failed back to the model instead of being silently dropped
- Queued keystrokes can no longer approve a tool approval prompt that was just swapped in
- The public repository's adapter tests are kept in sync with the source of record, which previously failed deterministically in the published checkout

## v0.preview.86 - 2026-08-20

### Added
- `/usage` dialog reporting per-model token usage, accounted client-side
- Double-click selects a word and triple-click selects a line in the transcript; alt-screen pager views (ctrl+o) copy on select

### Changed
- Thinking collapses to a pulsing marker while it streams, with the full text kept in the ctrl+o transcript; Anthropic adaptive thinking displays summarized by default
- Providers accept `stream_idle_timeout_secs` to override the 300-second default used for the first-event, SSE-idle, and WebSocket-idle deadlines
- Background job files persist until an explicit discard or the startup sweep, and waiting on a job is now a re-budgetable observation — an expired wait window changes nothing and can be extended; abandoning a shell call interrupts the process
- The experimental Browser tool and its optional Chromium dependency are removed
- `@agent-<name>` mentions no longer inject an "invoke the agent" reminder; the `@` popup keeps its completion rows as a typing convenience
- Dependency updates

### Fixed
- Copying a multi-line selection rejoins soft-wrapped lines instead of inserting hard breaks mid-sentence
- A permission-mode change (Shift+Tab) made while a turn is settling is no longer reverted when the turn commits

## v0.preview.85 - 2026-08-19

### Changed
- The `Abort` approval decision is removed from the wire protocol; "deny and stop" composes as a deny plus an interrupt

### Fixed
- Invalid permission rules in settings are surfaced as settings notices instead of being silently skipped, while the valid rules keep loading
- A background job's directory is cleaned up on any startup failure, instead of a failed output-file creation stranding it until the 24-hour GC sweep

## v0.preview.84 - 2026-08-18

### Changed
- Qwen 3.8 models send graded `reasoning_effort` levels instead of collapsing every level to thinking on/off, and the effort picker lists only the distinct supported levels
- MCP servers are discovered in parallel (one slow server no longer delays the rest), and MCP tool calls time out after 10 minutes — overridable via `ANTE_MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` — instead of pinning a turn until interrupt

### Fixed
- Headless (`ante -p`) sessions wait for MCP warm-up before the first turn, so MCP tools are present in the model's schema instead of every MCP call failing silently
- llama.cpp context overflows are recognized as context-full and trigger the one-time compaction retry instead of failing the turn
- Writing to a closed or broken output pipe (consumer exits, macOS EIO) is handled leniently instead of panicking during terminal teardown

## v0.preview.83 - 2026-08-18

### Added
- `include_skills` / `exclude_skills` settings control which skills a session equips; exclude wins over include

### Changed
- The `local` provider exists only while a live model server is registered; a saved `local` selection with no server running gates with a clear notice instead of retrying for ~17 seconds per turn
- Skill and agent lists moved from the system prompt to a first-message reminder, making the prompt byte-stable across sessions; subagents inherit the parent's skills
- The stable channel and installer only promote after artifacts pass an installer smoke test

### Fixed
- Long TUI sessions no longer retain render caches for archived scrollback, and transcripts beyond 65,535 rows stay complete

## v0.preview.82 - 2026-08-17

### Added
- `ante offline install` downloads and installs the bundled offline inference engine; running an offline model on a machine without the engine now fails fast with that instruction instead of an opaque error

### Changed
- Grep and Glob permission rules and session approvals now scope to the search pattern instead of blanketing the whole tool, and their transcript rows show just the pattern
- Tool calls in the transcript show wider, more balanced argument previews
- Markdown output is restyled: headings, ordered-list markers, inline code, tables, and fenced code blocks on a dark panel background
- `ante catalog` output is wrapped in a `{"providers": [...]}` envelope

## v0.preview.81 - 2026-08-15

### Added
- Qwen 3.8 27B as a verified offline model

### Changed
- macOS release binaries are signed and notarized, so Gatekeeper no longer blocks first launch
- Sent messages are restyled with a muted margin bar, and the composer prompt shows a chevron
- Quiet tool calls are grouped into one collapsing activity cell instead of stacking individual rows
- Log files are written to per-day directories (`logs/<date>/ante.<pid>.log`)
- Background job handles live under `run/jobs/<proc_id>/`, and the Ante home gains a `tmp/` scratch tier

## v0.preview.80 - 2026-08-14

### Changed
- The bundled `ante-guide` skill routes to the documentation corpus instead of inlining reference tables that drift, and no longer suggests the nonexistent `/permissions` command

### Fixed
- Empty streaming deltas from providers (Qwen-style reasoning placeholders, OpenRouter-style empty text) no longer fragment messages into broken parts

## v0.preview.79 - 2026-08-14

### Added
- Gemini 3.7 Flash in the native Gemini, Vertex AI Gemini, and OpenRouter catalogs

### Changed
- The bundled `ante-guide` skill answers configuration questions and edits Ante's own settings from a built-in reference, without cloning the docs repository

### Fixed
- The composer cursor no longer blinks, which broke scrollback in terminals that scroll on output
- WebSearch calls are capped at 90 seconds instead of hanging a tool batch

## v0.preview.78 - 2026-08-13

### Added
- Grok 4.6 in the Antix OAuth catalog
- DeepSeek V4 Pro 0813 on OpenRouter, replacing the superseded preview build, with the GA model's native `max` reasoning effort

### Changed
- Dependency updates

### Fixed
- xAI turns no longer fail with `Argument not supported: search_context_size` — the field is dropped from the provider-native web search tool, so xAI works without `--exclude-tools WebSearch`
- OAuth credentials refresh against the active preset's endpoint, and token issuer URLs are validated
- Antix Grok 4.5 is marked text-only, matching what the live route actually accepts
- `ante doctor` no longer errors when its output is piped to a consumer that closes the pipe early

## v0.preview.77 - 2026-08-12

### Added
- Grok 4.6 in the xAI and OpenRouter catalogs, replacing Grok 4.5

### Changed
- Thinking renders as markdown in the thinking grey, instead of showing raw `**` markers

### Fixed
- Hitting a usage limit no longer triggers repeated compaction attempts
- OpenAI server-overload errors are retried instead of failing the turn
- Background job handle files are cleaned up at startup once the job has finished, instead of accumulating
- `/term` reports tmux as missing instead of opening an empty picker
- An empty `ANTE_ENV` is treated as unset, so telemetry keeps its default environment label

## v0.preview.76 - 2026-08-11

### Added
- Qwen 3.8 Max, Qwen 3.7 Flash, and Muse Spark 1.2 in the OpenRouter catalog; the superseded Qwen 3.7 Max and Muse Spark 1.1 entries are pruned

### Changed
- Tool headers color their arguments — file paths, commands, search patterns — in the design blue instead of plain gray
- The composer cursor blinks
- Skill and agent frontmatter goes through one shared reader with size and nesting-depth limits, so oversized or malformed frontmatter fails with a clear error instead of being partially accepted

### Fixed
- Bundled skills are installed before the daemon starts serving, so they are usable on the very first launch after an update instead of only from the second launch on
- Multiline Grep searches over a directory run one worker at a time, so concurrent search buffers can no longer multiply peak memory
- The Grep header separates its pattern and path — `Search (foo in /tmp/src)` instead of `Search (foo)/tmp/src`

## v0.preview.75 - 2026-08-10

### Added
- Custom providers in the user catalog accept an `extra_body` map — provider-specific fields merged into chat and streaming request bodies, for gateways and proxies that require extra parameters. Keys that collide with Ante-owned request fields are dropped with a notice at catalog load instead of rejecting the whole provider

### Changed
- `SessionStart` and `SessionUpdated` no longer carry the active provider's full model list on the wire; that catalog data is available from `ante catalog`. Clients still receive the provider id, display name, and effective base URL

### Fixed
- Anthropic requests are compatible with proxies and gateways again: the unsupported context-management field is no longer sent, extended-thinking budgets respect the 1024-token minimum, and a temperature other than 1 with thinking enabled now fails with a clear message instead of a confusing provider error

## v0.preview.74 - 2026-08-10

### Changed
- When telemetry is configured, Ante uses a random, resettable installation ID and per-process run IDs; operator identity is sent only when explicitly configured

## v0.preview.73 - 2026-08-10

### Added
- Coming from Claude Code or Codex: when a session in this directory was active within the last 4 hours, startup offers to pick it up. `/resume-claude` and `/resume-codex` are bundled skills that locate the foreign transcript, read it as data, and reconstruct task, progress, and next step before confirming with you. The hint appears once per project and never in headless runs.
- `/import-claude` copies Claude Code's project memory for this directory into Ante's project memory. Existing Ante files are never overwritten, and re-running is a clean no-op.
- `settings.json` accepts `system_prompt`, `append_system_prompt`, and `tools` as fresh-session defaults, plus `auto_memory`, `skills`, and `session_save` with matching CLI overrides. Explicit CLI flags and wire values stay authoritative, and persisted custom prompt text is redacted from `ante rage` bundles.

### Changed
- Bump the bundled llama.cpp engine to b10217
- The built-in `bare` profile is now a real `bare.settings.json` file, seeded once and editable like any other profile

### Fixed
- Headless runs exit cleanly when their output consumer closes stdout or stderr, instead of panicking with a broken pipe

## v0.preview.72 - 2026-08-09

### Added
- Onboarding "Use API key" now takes a pasted key directly: masked input with provider auto-detect from the key prefix, validated against the provider, and stored owner-only under `~/.ante/auth` (env vars still take precedence)
- On the API-key step with Anthropic selected, `Tab` signs in to the Anthropic Console in the browser and provisions an API key automatically — the key never touches the clipboard
- Compaction results are now visible: a collapsed `* Compacted` marker appears in the conversation (manual and auto compaction), with the full summary in the ctrl+o transcript view; `CompactEnd` now carries the summary text on the wire, and trimmed oversized tool results are reported with an info line

### Changed
- Improved Bash command execution
- Antix OAuth is listed ahead of OpenAI in `/connect` and provider auto-detection

### Fixed
- A fresh install with no credentials no longer lands in a session silently wired to the unreachable built-in `localhost:8080` fallback — the not-connected state points at `/connect`, and a successful sign-in restarts the session on the newly connected provider
- Standalone `ante update` no longer panics with a broken pipe when its launcher closes stdout, and a closed pipe can no longer cancel an update

## v0.preview.71 - 2026-08-07

### Added
- `ante doctor` checks that the Ante home directory (`~/.ante`) is writable

### Changed
- Dependency updates

### Fixed
- Cancelling a running Bash tool call now kills its whole process group, so grandchild processes no longer keep running after Ante reports execution stopped
- Streaming model calls that produce no usable output within 5 minutes fail with a timeout instead of hanging the turn indefinitely
- The installer refuses `sudo` installs that would leave `~/.ante` root-owned, and startup shows a visible notice when the Ante home is unwritable
- Proxy `auth_unavailable` credential failures are classified as terminal auth errors instead of consuming the reconnect budget
- Parameterless tool schemas keep an explicit empty `properties` object on OpenAI-compatible requests, fixing rejections from strict endpoints

## v0.preview.70 - 2026-08-03

### Added
- `--profile <name>`: named settings profiles as whole-file replacement settings files (`<name>.settings.json`), plus the `ANTE_PROFILE` env var and a built-in file-less `bare` profile
- Bare `/term` opens a terminal picker — list, attach/detach, kill, and create sessions

### Changed
- Updates now ride the normal TUI flow: when a new version is available an in-chat notice shows its release notes, and `/update` installs it on exit (`/update skip` dismisses that version, `/update cancel` unschedules); the blocking startup modal is gone, and running sessions now check for updates hourly
- Use DeepSeek V4 Flash 0731 on OpenRouter
- Nightly builds log at debug level by default
- SKILL.md reads are labeled as skill loads in the transcript

### Fixed
- `ante catalog` exits cleanly instead of panicking when its output pipe closes early
- Brighter agent response text; thinking text pinned to foreground gray
- Hidden hardware cursor parked at the composer so OS IME popups appear at the caret
- Z.ai five-hour usage-limit errors (code 1308) are classified as terminal quota instead of being retried

## v0.preview.69 - 2026-08-02

### Added
- Shift+Enter and Ctrl+Enter insert a newline in the composer on terminals with kitty keyboard protocol support (kitty, ghostty, WezTerm, iTerm2 3.5+, Alacritty 0.13+)

### Changed
- Diff View V2 across all diff surfaces — chat Edit/Write details, the `/diff` pager, the approval Tab preview, and the theme dialog: numbered line gutter, full-width added/removed background bands, and `+N -M` change counts inline in headers

### Fixed
- Normalize MCP tool schemas to the portable provider subset at ingestion, so servers using advanced JSON Schema keywords (`exclusiveMinimum`, `$ref`, `oneOf`, …) no longer get requests rejected by strict providers such as Gemini
- Merge system prompt fragments into a single leading system message for unrecognized OpenAI-compatible models, fixing strict local chat templates that error on multiple system messages
- Spinner token count now shows only tokens generated this turn (it previously re-added the full context every generation, inflating wildly), with a ↑/↓ request/stream phase arrow
- Gemini quota errors that mention token limits are classified as quota, not context overflow, so they no longer trigger futile compaction

## v0.preview.68 - 2026-07-31

### Added
- `/term <name> [args...]` launches the named binary in the fresh session — `/term claude --continue` opens a split already running claude; existing sessions still just attach
- `terminals` status-line chip (on by default) showing live `ante-*` tmux sessions by name
- `--no-skills` run flag: skip skill discovery entirely (nothing advertised in the system prompt or dispatchable as commands); `/resume` preserves the choice

### Changed
- Repeated `/term` calls stack viewer splits in one right-hand column, replacing the composed `ante-view-*` viewer — every agent keeps a full-width column and Ante keeps its size
- Two-row footer: identity items (model, dir, branch, …) on top, permission mode and activity chips beneath
- Default DeepSeek V4 Flash to max reasoning effort on all routes (Antix, direct, OpenRouter)
- Dependency updates

### Fixed
- Fully typed commands that take arguments (e.g. bare `/term`) no longer swallow the first Enter

## v0.preview.67 - 2026-07-29

### Added
- `/term <a> <b>` composes a side-by-side viewer over several sessions in one window — watch or compare two terminal agents at once
- Bundled `tmux` skill: session reuse, interactive-program input, and driving other CLI agents such as Claude Code or Codex
- Discover skills from user-level `~/.claude/skills`, and highlight recognized commands in the composer
- `@`-mention completion for `~/`, absolute, `../`, and `./` paths
- Delete sessions from the `/resume` picker

### Changed
- Replace `/pty` with `/term`: the agent drives durable named tmux sessions through ordinary Bash (namespaced `ante-*`), and `/term <name>` opens a native terminal split/window to watch or type; sessions survive Ante restarts
- No subprocesses or file writes before the TUI's first frame (faster, quieter startup)
- Bump the bundled llama.cpp engine to b10107

### Fixed
- Redact the OAuth callback query from logs
- Parse model `weight_class` values case-insensitively

## v0.preview.66 - 2026-07-26

### Added
- Per-category context-window usage reporting over the protocol (`Op::ContextReport`)

### Changed
- Speed up Grep further by parallelizing the directory walk and search (large-corpus searches 40–70% faster)
- Update and prune the built-in model catalogs

### Fixed
- Don't abort OAuth login when stdin closes

## v0.preview.65 - 2026-07-25

### Added
- Add a `/pty` window that attaches a native terminal side panel
- Render LaTeX math in the TUI via a delimiter normalizer and TeX→Unicode converter
- Add an auto compact setting

### Changed
- `--tools` now sets the base tool set and `--include-tools` adds on top of it

## v0.preview.64 - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Omit absent optional arguments from tool call displays

## v0.preview.63 - 2026-07-21

### Added
- Add Tencent Hy3 to the OpenRouter model catalog and pricing table
- Include step count in turn end events

### Changed
- Markdown render improved by 93% for long streams
- Remove Qwen 3.7 Max/Plus from the OpenRouter catalog (endpoints no longer accessible); they remain available via Antix
- Render markdown lists directly instead of via tui-markdown
- Inset all TUI rows two columns from the window edge
- Consolidate the ante-guide into a bundled, model-only skill
- Warn when concurrent Edit/Write mutations target the same file path
- Prune older built-in model catalog entries

### Fixed
- Reject tool calls with malformed arguments before execution and return the parse error so the model can retry
- Handle tool calls truncated at the output-token limit gracefully across all providers, continuing the turn instead of surfacing a hard error
- Drop malformed ambient replies instead of leaking model reasoning

## v0.preview.61 - 2026-07-19

### Added
- Client-side PDF reads: page rendering, text extraction, and page bounding
- CLI option to load a system prompt from a file
- WebFetch spills oversized responses to a cache file instead of truncating

### Changed
- Corrective tool errors and no line clipping in Read

- TUI rendering performance and composer text contrast improvements

### Fixed
- Fall back to a usable provider instead of localhost for unknown provider ids
- Bound PDF render dimensions against hostile input

## v0.preview.60 - 2026-07-17

- Reconnect and resume when an LLM stream dies mid-response — even before any answer text has arrived — instead of ending the turn with an error

- Read the Zai provider API key from `ZAI_API_KEY`
- Fix a UTF-8 truncation bug in the ambient prompt

## v0.preview.46 - 2026-06-28

- Predict a short, task-specific spinner phrase while you type a longer prompt and show it as the spinner label for that turn (best-effort, runs on the cheapest model, off the critical path)
- Suggest a likely next prompt as dim ghost text after a turn ends, acceptable with Tab
- Keep destructive or alarming words out of the predicted spinner phrase
- Apply a permission-mode change (Shift+Tab) to the in-flight turn, so switching to Auto mid-turn takes effect immediately instead of on the next turn
