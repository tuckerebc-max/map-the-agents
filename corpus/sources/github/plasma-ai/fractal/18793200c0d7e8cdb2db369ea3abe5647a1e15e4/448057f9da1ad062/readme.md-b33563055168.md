Hierarchical agent loops with recursive self-organization.

In a fractal, autonomous agent loops arrange themselves into a tree: a node
iterates toward a goal in its own `git worktree` and spawns child nodes for
separable subtasks, so the tree grows to fit the problem rather than a fixed
plan. Hard caps (iterations, depth, children, cost, time) keep each loop
bounded, and an operator can steer or stop it at any point. Run metadata
(including cost) lands in one local `SQLite` database, which can be interacted
with live in a terminal UI.

> [!WARNING]
> **Nodes run their agent without permission prompts by default.** Unattended
> loops cannot stop to ask, so every seeded agent config disables the approval
> gate — Claude `bypassPermissions`, Codex `danger-full-access`, Grok
> `--always-approve`, opencode `--auto`, omp `--yolo`. A node can therefore run
> any command its agent decides to run, with your credentials and your machine's
> reach. The per-node `git worktree` isolates the *branch* it commits to, not
> the filesystem, the network, or anything else outside it. Only launch nodes
> whose task you would trust to run unsupervised, and prefer a sandboxed or
> otherwise disposable host for anything else.

## Installation

Install the `fractal` package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install plasma-fractal
```

or

```bash
pip install fractal
```

Use `pipx install` or `uv tool install` to install the package in an isolated
environment. If you use one of these two methods, you must also install
`plasma-wiki` (a plain `pip` install pulls `plasma-wiki` and puts `wiki` on your
`PATH`, but this is not the case when using `pipx install` or
`uv tool install`).

`uv tool install plasma-fractal --with-executables-from plasma-wiki` does the
same in one command.

Open the dashboard from your project root with `fractal open` (requires an
initialized fractal). Pass `--light` if your terminal uses a light color scheme.

### Skill

Install the skill for your agent via the plugin marketplace (Claude Code and
Codex):

```bash
# Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add plasma-ai/plugins
/plugin install fractal@plasma

# Codex
codex plugin marketplace add plasma-ai/plugins
codex plugin add fractal@plasma
```

Another install route is from the CLI, which copies (or symlinks) the fractal
and wiki skills into `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.agents/skills` (add `--project`
for the current project only):

```bash
fractal install [--link]
```

After upgrading the package, re-run `fractal install` to refresh the copied
skills (pass `--link` for symlinked install).

## Usage

A fractal is a tree of git worktrees, each running an autonomous agent loop. The
root (user) node is your current branch itself — it has no worktree or loop of
its own; top-level nodes branch from it, and child nodes branch from their
parent. Agents iterate in tmux sessions, and all state (runs, iters, steps,
costs, signals) is tracked in a local SQLite database.

Five agent backends are supported — Claude Code (`claude`), Codex (`codex`),
Grok Build (`grok`), OpenCode (`opencode`), and Oh My Pi (`omp`) — selected per
node with `--agent` (children inherit it). Claude and Codex can additionally
route through OpenRouter with `--provider=openrouter`, which authenticates via
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from the launching shell; OpenCode and Oh My Pi reach
OpenRouter natively through their own `openrouter/<author>/<model>` model ids.

Use the `/fractal` skill to spawn and manage agent nodes. The `fractal` CLI is
also available directly — run `fractal --help` and `fractal <command> --help` to
explore.

The skill is invoked as `/fractal [directive]` and takes plain-language
instructions. The agent interprets the directive and prints any suggested
`NODE.md` instructions and completion requirement it can distill from the
directive, plus a table of every parameter (empty where the directive said
nothing), then asks for anything it could not infer. From there it walks you
through refining the node's definition and, once you approve, launches the node
in a tmux session.

Parameters the skill interprets from the directive:

- **`name`**: node name (required; letters, digits, and `_` only — no `-`)
- **`path`**: project root, repo root or monorepo sub-project (default: `.`)
- **`title`**: human-readable display name (default: de-slugged node name)
- **`scope`**: restrict commits to subdirectories within the worktree
  (comma-separated, e.g. `parent/child,tests`)
- **`base`**: branch to start from (default: current branch)
- **`meta`**: target node branch for meta-configuration
- **`inherit`**: seed surfaces from the parent node instead of the package seed
  (comma-separated: `steps`, `scripts`, `skills`, `config`, or `all`); agent
  config always inherits. A top-level spawn's parent is the user node, which
  carries no steps, scripts, or skills — the parameter is for configured nodes
  spawning children
- **`agent`**: agent command; inherits the user node's default when omitted
- **`provider`**: provider route for the agent (e.g. `openrouter`); inherits the
  user node's default when omitted
- **`model`**: model override; when omitted, the agent uses its own default
  model (Claude runs on the seed's `best` alias, or
  `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` when routed through OpenRouter)
- **`effort`**: reasoning-effort override; when omitted, the Claude and Codex
  seeds' own pinned level (`high`) applies rather than the vendor default, while
  Grok, OpenCode, and Oh My Pi fall back to the vendor default
- **`max-iters`**: per-run iteration cap
- **`max-depth`**: maximum child node nesting depth
- **`max-children`**: maximum direct child nodes
- **`max-descendants`**: maximum total descendant nodes
- **`timeout`**: per-run time limit (e.g. `30m`, `1.5h`)
- **`iter-timeout`**: per-iteration time limit (e.g. `30m`, `1.5h`)
- **`step-timeout`**: per-step time limit (e.g. `30s`, `10m`); caps each step
- **`interval`**: fixed iteration schedule (e.g. `1h`)
- **`sleep`**: delay between iterations (e.g. `10s`)
- **`wait`**: sleep between approval-wait sync invocations (default: `1m`)
- **`max-cost`**: cost ceiling in USD per run — runs are isolated, so each
  launch arms the cap anew; after a budget-ended run, `node start --continue`
  refuses without an explicit `--max-cost`
- **`max-iter-cost`**: per-iteration cost ceiling in USD
- **`max-step-cost`**: per-step cost ceiling in USD (warn-only when
  unenforceable)
- **`reserve-budget`**: budget reserved for cleanup; USD or N% of `max-cost`
  (default: 10%)
- **`sync`**: enable (default) or disable radio sync before each step
- **`detached`**: run each step as a separate agent session (default: one
  continuous session)
- **`local`**: skip pushing to remote after each commit

## Development

### Install

Run `install.sh` in the package root. With no environment active it creates and
uses a local `.venv`; with one active (e.g. pyenv) it installs into that
environment (editable), without recreating it:

```bash
./install.sh --all-extras --groups=test,lint,type
```

Run `./install.sh --help` for all options. Alternatively, run
`uv sync --all-extras --group test --group lint --group type` and
`uv run pre-commit install` to set up the environment manually.

Installing a dependency as editable (e.g. a sibling package) is left to the
caller: `uv pip install --editable <path>`.

With an editable install, `fractal install --link` symlinks the bundled skill
into the agent skill directories instead of copying it, so skill edits apply
without re-running the install.

Once installed, run tools with `uv run --no-sync <command>`, or activate the
environment first (`source .venv/bin/activate`).

### Tests

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest .
```

The suite runs with `--doctest-modules` enabled, and the integration tests
create real git repositories and worktrees.

### Linting

Run linters and formatters:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Contributing

The contribution workflow, repository conventions, and release process (version
sources, tagging, CI guard) are documented in:

- Contribution workflow (organization-wide):
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/plasma-ai/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Repository conventions:
  [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/plasma-ai/fractal/blob/main/AGENTS.md)
- Release process (organization-wide):

Pull requests should be branched from `dev`, not `main`, and opened against
`dev` — `main` only advances at releases.
