# Agent notes

Project context for coding agents. Human setup and PR conventions live in
[.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), and what a review looks
for in [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md). Fill the Scope section of the pull request
template: a review reads it to tell the change you meant from the change you
made.

## Product boundary

Keep agent-manager a thin wrapper around the supported TUIs. Preserve upstream
defaults and user configuration; avoid hardcoded models, version-specific
behavior, and recreating upstream settings. Apply the
[Thin Wrapper Principle](PRODUCT.md#thin-wrapper-principle) to every integration,
including shared controls, capability discovery, and status detection.
Provider-specific features multiply ongoing maintenance. Supporting a TUI does
not mean mirroring its feature set; prefer workspace features shared across tools.

## Build and test

```bash
go run .                                        # run the TUI
go build ./...
env -u TMUX TMUX_TMPDIR=/tmp/amtest go test ./...
```

The suite drives a real tmux server. When your own shell already runs inside
tmux, `$TMUX` overrides `TMUX_TMPDIR` and the tests land on the live socket,
so `env -u TMUX` is mandatory, never a bare `go test`. Keep the socket dir
short: `TMUX_TMPDIR/tmux-<uid>/default` must stay under 104 characters or
tmux silently falls back to the default socket. Never run `tmux kill-server`
or `kill-session` against the default socket; kill stray processes by PID.

Before finishing: `gofmt -l .` prints nothing, `go vet ./...` is clean.

## Concurrent sessions

Multiple agent sessions share this checkout. Do feature work in an isolated
git worktree (`git worktree add`), or your edits get swept into someone
else's commit. Branch from `origin/main` after a fetch, not from the local
`main` ref.

## Releases

Cut from a clean worktree at the tag, with goreleaser run locally; there is
no release workflow in CI.

```bash
tag=v0.30.0                       # the release being cut
git tag "$tag" && git push origin "$tag"
git worktree add /tmp/amrel "$tag"
cd /tmp/amrel && GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" AUR_KEY="$HOME/.ssh/aur_agent_manager" \
  goreleaser release --clean
```

`AUR_KEY` is what publishes the Arch package: without it `git_url` templates
to empty, goreleaser skips that step, and the release still reports success
while the AUR package goes stale.

The notes carry more than the generated list of pull requests:

- **A summary in your own words**, at the top, saying what the release gives
  someone who installs it. Two or three sentences, the change first and the
  mechanism second. The generated list says which pull requests landed; it
  does not say what is different now.
- **A `## Highlights` section above `## What's Changed`**, holding short
  bullets, one per thing the release gives someone. The manager reads
  exactly those bullets into its messages panel, so write them for a modal:
  a sentence each, feature and fix language, no pull request numbers. Prose
  in that section stays on the web page; only bullets travel. A release
  without the section falls back to the generated list, filtered to
  `feat`, `fix` and `perf`.
- **A `## Thank you` section**, one bullet per person: handle, what they
  did, PR or issue number. The manager reads those bullets into the
  messages panel under the highlights, labelled Thank you. Prose in that
  section stays on the web page; only bullets travel. Cover PR authors and
  issue reporters: the generated changelog names authors only, and a fix
  exists because someone wrote the bug up. Credit the release a feature
  builds on, too, when it extends someone else's work. A range with nobody
  outside the maintainer omits the section.

`--release-notes=notes.md` replaces the generated list of pull requests
rather than sitting above it, so a file passed that way has to carry the
list itself. Publishing first and then editing is the simpler order: take
what goreleaser published with `gh release view <tag> --json body -q .body`,
put the summary, the highlights and the thanks above its `## What's Changed`,
and send it back with `gh release edit <tag> --notes-file notes.md`. The
header and footer from `.goreleaser.yaml` come along either way.

## Layout

- `main.go` dispatches subcommands (`rename`, `review-repo`, `sessions`,
  `spawn`, `mcp`, and the rest of the workspace CLI) and boots the TUI.
- `internal/ui` is the Bubble Tea program: one `Model`, files grouped by
  feature (list, diff review, focus, quick prompt, settings).
- `internal/tmux` owns the dedicated tmux socket and control-mode client;
  `internal/store` is the SQLite state; `internal/status` classifies pane
  output into agent states; `internal/config` loads `config.toml` and the
  tool rules.
- The badges workflow publishes the clone count and contributor image to the
  `badges` branch; neither generated asset is edited by hand.

## Style

- Comments are rare and explain a non-obvious why, never what the code does.
- No speculative branches for inputs that cannot occur; verify the real
  shape first.
- Tests live next to the file they cover: a test for `listview.go` belongs
  in `listview_test.go`.
- A change holds for every tool in `defaultConfig` and every platform
  `.goreleaser.yaml` builds; [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md) says what to do when one
  of them is left out.
