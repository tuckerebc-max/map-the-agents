# Configuration

CAO stores user configuration in a single file, `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/settings.json`. This consolidates what used to be two separate files (`settings.json` and `config.json`) into one unified schema, resolved through one precedence chain:

```
CLI flag  >  CAO_* environment variable  >  settings.json  >  built-in default
```

`ConfigService` (`services/config_service.py`) is the single reader/writer behind this precedence chain. `agents`, `skills`, `server`, `memory`, `terminal`, and `apps` are fully wired: setting any of their keys in `settings.json` (or the mapped `CAO_*` env var) has a real runtime effect. `network` and `auth` are schema-only for now — see the "env-var only" callouts in those sections below and in the env-var reference.

> `.env` file handling (`utils/env.py`, forwarded provider env vars) is a separate, out-of-scope surface — unaffected by this doc.

## Data directory (`CAO_HOME_DIR`)

All CAO state lives under a single base directory, `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator` by default: the SQLite DB, logs, FIFOs, memory, the `agent-store` / `agent-context` profile dirs, skills, workflow scratch, and `settings.json` itself.

Set the `CAO_HOME_DIR` environment variable to relocate that entire tree:

```bash
export CAO_HOME_DIR="$HOME/.cli-agent-orchestrator"
```

Every derived path resolves from this value, so one override moves everything — with two exceptions noted below. `CAO_HOME_DIR` is read once, when CAO's `constants` module is first imported (the same convention as `CAO_AGENTS_DIR`), so export it **before** starting `cao-server`, the MCP servers, or any `cao` command. All CAO processes must resolve the same location. Empty or whitespace-only values are treated as unset, and tilde (`~`) is expanded.

**When to use it.** Some environments restrict or sandbox access to `~/.aws` at the OS level to protect AWS credentials. Because CAO otherwise stores its data there, including the agent profiles it reads during a `handoff`, a locked-down `~/.aws` can leave CAO unable to read its own data (a handoff then fails with `Permission denied`). Relocating `CAO_HOME_DIR` outside `~/.aws` keeps CAO working while leaving those credential protections in place.

**Security note.** When relocating outside `~/.aws`, choose a dedicated directory that is not world-readable or shared with other users. CAO creates its base directory and log/FIFO subdirectories with owner-only permissions (mode `0700`), and applies a best-effort `chmod` to an existing base directory, but the chosen parent path should also be private since terminal logs can capture secrets and tokens.

**Exceptions.** Two categories of provider-specific config directories do **not** follow `CAO_HOME_DIR`:

- `~/.aws/opencode` (OpenCode provider config, managed via `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` in `constants.py`) — OpenCode is told its config location at launch via env vars; a follow-up can repoint this.
- Provider-native agent directories (`~/.kiro/agents`, `~/.copilot/agents`) — intentionally separate since each provider manages its own agent install path independently of CAO's data tree.

## Sections

### Agents (`agents`)

CAO discovers agent profiles by scanning multiple directories, in this order (first match wins):

1. **Local store** — `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/agent-store/`
2. **Provider-specific directories** — `agents.dirs`, keyed by provider
3. **Extra custom directories** — `agents.extra_dirs`
4. **Built-in store** — bundled with the CAO package

| Key | Provider | Default Path |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `kiro_cli` | Kiro CLI | `~/.kiro/agents` |
| `claude_code` | Claude Code | `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/agent-store` |
| `codex` | Codex | `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/agent-store` |
| `cao_installed` | CAO Installed | `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/agent-context` |

Override via REST API, Web UI Settings page, `cao config set agents.dirs.<provider> <path>`, or editing `settings.json` directly. Only specified providers are updated; others keep their defaults.

`agents.disabled_dirs` lists configured directories (defaults or extras) the user has toggled **off**: a disabled directory stays listed in Settings but is skipped when scanning for and loading agent profiles, so its profiles leave the active set without removing the path (GH #280/#281). Only paths that match a configured directory are accepted; entries are validated with the same path normalization the scanner uses (`~`, trailing slashes, and symlinks all match). Manage it via the Web UI Settings toggles, `cao config set agents.disabled_dirs '[...]'`, or `settings.json`.

`agents.roles` defines custom [role](../CODEBASE.md) → `allowedTools` bundles, layered on top of the built-in `supervisor` / `reviewer` / `developer` / `workflow_scout` roles.

### Skills (`skills`)

Skills (loaded on demand via the `load_skill` MCP tool) are discovered from, in order:

1. **Global skill store** — `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/skills/`
2. **Extra custom directories** — `skills.extra_dirs`

`skills.extra_dirs` lets you keep a project's skills in the project repo (e.g. `<repo>/.cao/skills`) and register the directory instead of copying/symlinking each skill into the global store.

### Server (`server`)

Timeouts and buffer sizes used by the CAO runtime. All values have safe defaults — only override if you experience timeouts or queue overflows.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `mcp_request_timeout` | `30` | Seconds to wait for HTTP calls between the MCP server process and the CAO API. |
| `event_bus_max_queue_size` | `1024` | Max events buffered per subscriber queue in the internal event bus. |
| `provider_init_timeout` | `60` | Seconds to wait for a CLI agent to reach IDLE. Also the hard outer cap on total time a startup-prompt handler (Claude Code, Kimi, Antigravity) may run. Overridable per-profile via `provider_init_timeout` in the agent profile — see [Agent Profile Format](agent-profile.md#optional-fields). |
| `startup_prompt_handler_timeout` | `20` | Idle gap, in seconds, between consecutive startup prompts (e.g. workspace trust / bypass dialogs, Kimi's upgrade dialog, Antigravity's trust/survey dialogs). The handler polls and resets this timer each time it answers a prompt; it only starts counting once the FIRST prompt has been handled, so a first dialog arriving later than this value (e.g. a cold/containerized start) is still caught — before any prompt is seen, only `provider_init_timeout` bounds the wait. Once at least one prompt has been handled, the handler exits after this many seconds pass with no further prompt. |
| `state_buffer_max` | `32768` | Bytes of raw terminal output `StatusMonitor` keeps per terminal for raw-path status detection and `GET /terminals/{id}/output` (`mode=full`). Not unbounded scrollback — a long, chatty session is truncated to this trailing window; raise it if a still-pending prompt is getting evicted before it's read back. |

### Memory (`memory`)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch for the memory subsystem. |
| `compile_mode` | `"llm"` | `llm` or `append`. `append` skips the LLM wiki-compiler entirely. |
| `flush_threshold` | `0.85` | Context-usage fraction that triggers a memory flush. |
| `compile_timeout_s` | `120.0` | Wall-clock timeout for the wiki compile call. |
| `vault` | `{}` | Validated Obsidian vault source configuration. `CAO_MEMORY_VAULT_ENABLED=false` can disable it but cannot enable an absent or file-disabled configuration. |
| `learning_enabled` | `false` | Opt-in switch for workflow self-learning (outcome capture via `report_outcome` / `/outcomes`). Requires `enabled=true` — a disabled memory subsystem forces learning off. Env override: `CAO_MEMORY_LEARNING_ENABLED`. See [Self-Learning](self-learning.md). |
| `instruction_promotion_enabled` | `false` | Opt-in switch for promoting reinforced lessons into agent profile files (`cao memory promote --apply`). Requires `learning_enabled=true` (promotion ⊂ learning ⊂ memory). Env override: `CAO_MEMORY_INSTRUCTION_PROMOTION_ENABLED`. ⚠️ Promoted lesson text is agent-generated: review every promote diff as an untrusted-instruction change before applying — see [Self-Learning](self-learning.md#phase-2--instruction-promotion). |
| `workflow_journal_capture_output` | `false` | ⚠️ **Security-relevant opt-in, but narrower than it sounds — read the note below this table.** Governs exactly two surfaces: the **event log's** output digest, and the **diagnostics bundle's** output excerpts. Turning it ON adds step output text to those two. It does **not** control the `workflow_run_step` projection, which retains output unconditionally either way. Retained text is size-capped (below) and cleaned through the shared `audit_log` sanitizer — transport hygiene (control-character stripping, size limiting), **not** secret redaction: a credential in a step's output is retained verbatim. |
| `workflow_journal_output_cap_bytes` | `8192` | Per-output byte cap applied when `workflow_journal_capture_output` is on; anything longer is truncated with the shared `[…truncated]` marker. Deliberately above `audit_log`'s 4 KiB per-field cap because a worker step's output is materially larger than a single audit field. Must be `>= 1`. |
| `workflow_journal_retention_days` | `30` | Age bound for the startup retention sweep: a run whose `started_at` is older than this many days is pruned (run row, steps, events, and seq high-water, in one cascade). **`0` DISABLES the age bound** (unlimited) — it does not mean "expire everything". Must be `>= 0`. |
| `workflow_journal_retention_count` | `100` | Run-count bound for the same sweep: runs beyond the most-recent N are pruned. Pruning is the **union** of the two bounds — whichever matches a run first removes it. **`0` DISABLES the count bound** (unlimited) — it does not mean "keep zero runs"; both bounds at `0` makes the sweep a no-op. To remove a specific run, use `DELETE /workflows/runs/{id}` instead. Must be `>= 0`. |

> #### ⚠️ Step output is retained regardless of `workflow_journal_capture_output`

#### Obsidian vault

`memory.vault` is an optional, file-defined configuration for one managed
Obsidian vault. It defines the vault root, mappings from vault-relative folders
to memory scopes, and the CAO-owned managed folder. The environment variable
`CAO_MEMORY_VAULT_ENABLED` can only disable that configuration; it cannot
configure a root, folder mapping, or scope.

See [Obsidian Vault](obsidian-vault.md) for the complete configuration example,
limits, secret-gate behavior, safety model, and maintenance commands.

### Terminal backend (`terminal`)

CAO's default backend is [tmux](tmux.md). [herdr](https://herdr.dev/) is an experimental, opt-in alternative — a terminal-native agent runtime that exposes real-time status events instead of requiring CAO to poll and pattern-match terminal output.

```json
{
  "terminal": {
    "backend": "herdr",
    "herdr_session": "my-session"
  }
}
```

- `backend`: `"tmux"` (default) or `"herdr"` [EXPERIMENTAL].
- `herdr_session`: the herdr session name to connect to (default `"cao"`).
- `spawn_mode`: `"window"` (default) or `"pane"` — where a terminal created by
  `assign` / `handoff` lands. See [Watching a fleet in one window](#watching-a-fleet-in-one-window).
- `pane_window`: the window `spawn_mode: "pane"` shares (default `"cao-agents"`).
  The first pane terminal in a session creates it; nothing has to exist first.
- `pane_layout`: how that window is re-arranged after each spawn — `"tiled"`
  (default), `"even-vertical"`, `"even-horizontal"`, or `"none"`. See
  [Choosing a layout](#choosing-a-layout).

Select a backend for a single run without touching `settings.json`:

```bash
cao-server --terminal herdr
```

`--terminal` (CLI flag) beats `CAO_TERMINAL_BACKEND` (env var) beats `terminal.backend` (file) beats the `"tmux"` default — the standard precedence chain. See [herdr.md](herdr.md) for herdr-specific setup, viewing/attaching, and troubleshooting.

#### Watching a fleet in one window

By default each terminal gets a tmux window of its own, so watching several
agents means cycling through windows and a drifting agent is easy to miss.
`spawn_mode: "pane"` puts every terminal into one window as a pane instead, so
the whole fleet is visible at once and an agent can be interrupted where it
sits. Panes are re-tiled after each spawn, so the window stays readable as the
fleet grows.

```json
{
  "terminal": {
    "spawn_mode": "pane",
    "pane_window": "cao-agents",
    "pane_layout": "tiled"
  }
}
```

#### Choosing a layout

`pane_layout` names the arrangement, not the split. There is no separate
split-direction setting because `select-layout` overrides the direction a pane
was split in: split sideways, lay out `even-vertical`, and the panes are stacked
regardless. The split still follows the layout's axis, because tmux refuses a
split for want of room along the axis being *split* rather than the one the
layout settles on.

| `pane_layout` | Arrangement | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `tiled` (default) | grid, re-balanced each spawn | watching a fleet — it holds the most panes |
| `even-vertical` | full-width rows | output is wide; reading long lines matters more than agent count |
| `even-horizontal` | full-height columns | following a few agents' scrollback side by side |
| `none` | tmux's own behaviour — each split halves the last pane | you arrange the window yourself |

The layout also decides how many agents fit before the window is full, and the
one that does not fit becomes a window of its own with a warning. `tiled` holds
by far the most, because it grows in both directions; `even-vertical` and
`even-horizontal` are bounded by the rows or columns a pane needs along one
axis; `none` is the lowest of all, since each split halves the pane it came from.

That ceiling is lower than it looks on a small terminal and it is not a fixed
number -- it moves with the window size, the tmux version, and anything in
`tmux.conf` that costs a row, such as the status line or pane borders. Measure
it for a given setup rather than trusting a figure:

```bash
# -L keeps this off the server your own sessions live on; the name is unique to
# this run, nothing past the && happens unless this run created the session, and
# the cleanup names that session rather than tearing the server down.
s="cao-cap-$$"
tmux -L cao-cap new-session -d -s "$s" -x 80 -y 24 && {
  while tmux -L cao-cap split-window -v -t "$s" 2>/dev/null; do
    tmux -L cao-cap select-layout -t "$s" even-vertical >/dev/null
  done
  tmux -L cao-cap list-panes -t "$s" | wc -l
  tmux -L cao-cap kill-session -t "$s"
}
```

`tiled` is the default because a fleet is what pane mode is for; the others trade
capacity for a shape that suits fewer agents.

A terminal that shares a window cannot be identified by that window's name, so
each pane carries its terminal name in the `@cao_terminal` pane option and
every lookup resolves through it. Set that option only at pane scope — pane
options inherit from window options, and a value set globally would make every
pane answer to the same name.

That name is also what the window shows. The first pane terminal turns on
`pane-border-status` for `pane_window` and formats the border with the mark, so
every pane is captioned with the terminal running in it. The caption reads the
mark rather than the pane title because a program in the pane can set its own
title: an agent whose TUI does that turns a title-based caption into whatever
the agent wants, while the mark is out of its reach.

Both options are set on `pane_window` alone, and only when that window carries
no `pane-border-status` of its own -- so a window you arranged yourself keeps
its borders, `pane-border-status off` stays off, and a window CAO opened before
this existed is captioned on the next spawn into it rather than never. A pane
you split by hand carries no mark and is captioned with its index. The captions
cost one row per pane, which counts against the capacity above.

`pane_window` does not have to exist: the first pane-mode terminal in a session
creates it and takes its first pane, and the ones after it split that window.

A window only holds so many panes before tmux refuses for want of space. That
terminal is created as a window of its own instead, and a warning says so — the
spawn is not failed. Other failures, such as a name already taken or a refused
working directory, are reported rather than worked around.

The name is a label, not an authenticated identity: anything that can reach the
tmux socket can set the same mark. Agents are not isolated from each other here,
so this is in line with the rest of the backend rather than a new exposure.

### MCP Apps (`apps`)

Default-off. See [../src/cli_agent_orchestrator/ext_apps/apps.py](../src/cli_agent_orchestrator/ext_apps/apps.py) for the `ui://cao/*` MCP App resource surface this gates.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Enables the MCP Apps surface (dashboard/agent/event-stream views + app tools + topology widget). |
| `static_dir` | `null` | Override for the built `apps_static/` directory (packaged/dev-tree locations are tried automatically otherwise). |

### Network (`network`) — env-var only

> **`network.*` keys in `settings.json` are schema-only and have no runtime effect yet.** `constants.py` builds `CORS_ORIGINS` / `ALLOWED_HOSTS` / `WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS` as module-level lists at import time, and Starlette's CORS/TrustedHost middleware are instantiated once at server startup holding a reference to those exact list objects (`add_local_cors_origins` depends on this reference semantics). Only the `CAO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` / `CAO_CORS_ORIGINS` / `CAO_WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS` / `CAO_WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` / `CAO_FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` env vars are read — directly in `constants.py`, not through `ConfigService`. Routing these through the unified config would require either a live-invalidation path for the middleware's list references or restructuring how the middleware is wired; both are out of scope for this PR.

`cao-server` is a local-only service by default. These env vars **extend** (not replace) the loopback-only built-in defaults, so loopback access is preserved even when set.

| Env var | Extends | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `CAO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `ALLOWED_HOSTS` (Host header allowlist for `TrustedHostMiddleware`) | Fronting cao-server with a reverse proxy at a non-localhost hostname. |
| `CAO_CORS_ORIGINS` | `CORS_ORIGINS` (browser origins permitted by CORS) | Serving the web UI from a non-default port or origin. |
| `CAO_WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS` | `WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS` (client IPs permitted to attach to the PTY WebSocket) | Running `cao-server` inside Docker (host browser arrives via a bridge IP). |
| `CAO_WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (extra browser `Origin`s permitted to attach to the PTY WebSocket) | Serving the terminal viewer from a page whose origin **differs** from the cao-server host (a separate reverse-proxy hostname or dashboard). |

> **Security note:** an accepted WebSocket PTY connection grants full
> read/write access to a running agent terminal. When authentication is enabled
> by `CAO_AUTH_JWKS_URI` or `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, attachment requires a valid bearer
> token granting `cao:write` or `cao:admin`. These are existing CAO scopes;
> `cao:read` alone is not sufficient. With neither variable set, no token is
> required. Only add client IPs you actually trust to `CAO_WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS`,
> and do not expose the endpoint to untrusted networks. Authentication does
> not replace the client-IP or Origin checks, and widening either allowlist
> does not bypass authentication. See the [Auth settings](#auth-auth--env-var-only)
> and [PTY WebSocket contract](api.md#pty-websocket) for configuration, token
> transports, and refusal outcomes.
>
> The endpoint also enforces an **Origin** check to block cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CWE-1385): a browser page that is not same-origin with the cao-server host (and not in `CAO_WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`) is refused. Same-origin viewers — including the bundled UI, imported-app deployments (`uvicorn cli_agent_orchestrator.api.main:app`), and dynamic reverse-proxy / Codespaces hostnames — pass this Origin check without extra Origin configuration, because the check accepts any `Origin` whose authority equals the request `Host` (itself validated by `TrustedHostMiddleware`). Passing that check does not bypass the token requirement when authentication is enabled. `CAO_WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is only for *genuinely cross-origin* viewers; a literal `*` disables the Origin check. Note that `CAO_CORS_ORIGINS="*"` does **not** disable it — PTY access is more sensitive than ordinary CORS reads, so the escape hatch is the dedicated `CAO_WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="*"`.

### Auth (`auth`) — env-var only

> **`auth.*` keys in `settings.json` are schema-only and have no runtime effect yet.** `security/auth.py` is the actual authentication *enforcement* boundary (not a UX gate) and is deliberately kept on direct `os.getenv` reads in this PR, to avoid changing security-critical resolution behavior. Only the env vars below are honored.

Default-off auth core; see [security/auth.py](../src/cli_agent_orchestrator/security/auth.py). Auth activates in one of two opt-in modes:

- **IdP mode** — `CAO_AUTH_JWKS_URI` (or `AUTH0_DOMAIN`) is set. Bearer tokens are RS256 JWTs verified against the IdP's JWKS (signature, issuer, audience, expiry); scopes come from the token's claims.
- **Local-token mode** — no IdP, but `CAO_AUTH_LOCAL_TOKEN` is set. Every request to a scope-gated route, the PTY WebSocket handshake and the AG-UI stream must present that value as a bearer (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`, or the documented query parameter where a header cannot be set); the value is compared after trimming surrounding whitespace, and a blank value leaves auth off. A match grants the full scope set; a missing or different token is refused with HTTP 401 (close code 4401 on the WebSocket). The comparison is constant-time. This is the single-operator control for a workstation shared with other local users or agents: one exported variable both switches enforcement on and is the credential CAO's own clients (the MCP servers and orchestration helpers) forward, so nothing else needs configuring. Two things follow from that design. It is **all-or-nothing**: a shared secret carries no claims, so a match grants every scope and there is no read-only local token; use an IdP when you need `cao:read` without `cao:write`. And the credential is **inherited by every agent pane**: the server copies its `CAO_*` environment into each new tmux pane so the in-pane `cao-mcp-server` can authenticate its own calls, which means any agent process can read `CAO_AUTH_LOCAL_TOKEN`. That grants an agent no API access it did not already have (the default posture is unauthenticated), but it does turn the token into something a compromised agent can exfiltrate. Rotate it if an agent pane is ever exposed to untrusted input you would not want holding a write credential.

> **Default posture.** With none of the three variables set, the API performs no authentication or authorization at all: every scope dependency returns the full scope set and never inspects the request. The server binds to loopback by default, so the trust boundary is *the host*, not *the user* — any other process or local account on the machine can reach every endpoint, including keystroke injection into agent terminals. That is intentional for a single-user workstation and it is why the local-token mode exists for anything else. A few routes stay open in every mode because they carry no session or terminal state: `/health`, the API documentation (`/docs`, `/redoc`, `/openapi.json`), the OAuth discovery document, the agent-profile schema and template metadata and their validate/preview endpoints, and the static topology-widget assets.
>
> Two clients do not yet present a bearer in **either** auth mode and therefore cannot be used against an auth-enabled server without further work: the bundled Web UI, and the `cao` CLI's own HTTP calls (`cao launch`, `cao session`, `cao terminal`, `cao workflow`, `cao info`, `cao shutdown`). The `cao agent` subcommands, the MCP servers and the workflow orchestration helpers do forward `CAO_AUTH_LOCAL_TOKEN`.

| Env var | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `CAO_AUTH_JWKS_URI` | Generic IdP JWKS endpoint (IdP mode). |
| `CAO_AUTH_AUDIENCE` | Expected token audience (IdP mode). |
| `CAO_AUTH_ISSUER` | Issuer advertised by the RFC 9728 PRM endpoint (IdP mode). |
| `CAO_AUTH_LOCAL_TOKEN` | Alone: the shared-secret bearer that activates local-token mode. With an IdP: the machine JWT CAO's own clients forward on internal calls. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`; treat it as a write credential. |

### Logging (`logging`)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `level` | `"INFO"` | Log level for the CAO server log file. |

## Environment variable reference

### Wired through ConfigService

Every `CAO_*` variable below maps 1:1 to a `settings.json` key and is resolved through the standard precedence chain — the env var beats the file, and both lose to an explicit CLI flag where one exists. Setting either the env var or the `settings.json` key has a real runtime effect.

| Env var | Config path | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `CAO_TERMINAL_BACKEND` | `terminal.backend` | str |
| `CAO_HERDR_SESSION` | `terminal.herdr_session` | str |
| `CAO_TERMINAL_SPAWN_MODE` | `terminal.spawn_mode` | str |

The full table lives in `ConfigService.ENV_REGISTRY` (`services/config_service.py`) — the source of truth this doc mirrors.

### Env-var only (settings.json value not yet honored)

These map to `network.*` / `auth.*` schema paths for documentation purposes, but only the env var is actually read — see the "env-var only" notes in the [Network](#network-network--env-var-only) and [Auth](#auth-auth--env-var-only) sections above for why.

| Env var | Config path | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `CAO_AUTH_JWKS_URI` | `auth.jwks_uri` | str |
| `CAO_AUTH_AUDIENCE` | `auth.audience` | str |
| `CAO_AUTH_ISSUER` | `auth.issuer` | str |
| `CAO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `network.allowed_hosts` | comma-separated list |
| `CAO_CORS_ORIGINS` | `network.cors_origins` | comma-separated list |
| `CAO_WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS` | `network.ws_allowed_clients` | comma-separated list |
| `CAO_WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `network.ws_allowed_origins` | comma-separated list |

### Not yet routed through ConfigService

A number of other `CAO_*` variables (runtime/process-identity vars like `CAO_TERMINAL_ID`, `CAO_SESSION_NAME`, `CAO_WORKFLOW_RUN_ID`; provider-tuning vars like `CAO_HERMES_*`, `CAO_AGENTS_DIR`, `CAO_API_HOST`/`CAO_API_PORT`, `CAO_PYTE_STATUS`, `CAO_EAGER_INBOX_DELIVERY`; and `CAO_AUTH_LOCAL_TOKEN`) are still read ad hoc via `os.getenv` at their call sites, mostly in `constants.py`, `mcp_server/server.py`, `security/auth.py`, and the `providers/*` modules. These were deliberately left out of this pass to keep the diff scoped to the two surfaces issue #357 named explicitly (`settings.json` + `config.json`); folding them into the registry is a natural follow-up but not required for config unification.

| Env var | Default | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CAO_HOME_DIR` | `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator` | str (path) | Base directory for all CAO state. See [Data directory](#data-directory-cao_home_dir) above. |

Rendered-screen status detection adds `CAO_PYTE_STATUS` (default `true`) and `CAO_PYTE_MIDBURST_PROBE_S` (default `1.0`, the minimum interval between mid-burst PROCESSING probes; see [Event-Driven Architecture](event-driven-architecture.md#status-monitor-servicesstatus_monitorpy--publisher--consumer)), both read in `constants.py`. The pipe-pane liveness watchdog (issue #388, `services/fifo_reader.py`) adds six more of these ad-hoc vars, read directly via `_env_int`/`_env_float` in `constants.py` rather than through `ConfigService` — they have no `settings.json` mapping like the rows in the table above:

| Env var | Default | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_CHECK_INTERVAL_S` | `4.0` | float | How often the watchdog compares live pane content against FIFO delivery, per enrolled terminal. |
| `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_TAIL_LINES` | `80` | int | Lines of live pane content compared each check (`capture-pane` tail size). |
| `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_STALL_CHECKS` | `2` | int | Consecutive diverging checks required before re-arming a stalled forwarder. |
| `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_MAX_REARM_FAILURES` | `5` | int | Consecutive failed re-arm attempts before the watchdog gives up on a terminal. |
| `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_COLD_START_GRACE_S` | `3.0` | float | Grace period after a terminal is registered before a FIFO that has never delivered a single byte is treated as a cold-start stall (harness-control#93) instead of "still booting". |
| `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_MAX_COLD_START_ATTEMPTS` | `5` | int | Consecutive cold-start re-arm attempts (rearm() succeeded but the pipe still never delivered) before the watchdog gives up on a terminal — a separate failure class and counter from `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_MAX_REARM_FAILURES`, which only counts rearm() raising. |

The `cao fleet` / `cao worker` commands ([control planes](control-planes.md#remote-fleets)) add two more, read directly in `utils/fleet.py`. They are the only configuration those commands take, and neither has a default: without both, every leaf exits with `No fleet configured.` rather than falling back to the local server.

| Env var | Default | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CAO_ELASTIC_BROKER_URL` | *(none)* | str (URL) | Base URL of the fleet's worker broker, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:9890` after a port-forward. |
| `CAO_ELASTIC_BROKER_TOKEN` | *(none)* | str | Shared secret sent as `X-CAO-Broker-Token`. It authorizes releasing workers and sending input to their agents, so treat it as a write credential. |

## Migrating from the old two-file setup

Previously, `terminal_backend` / `herdr_session` lived in a separate `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/config.json`, read inline by `backends/factory.py`. On first read after upgrading, if `config.json` exists and `settings.json` has no `terminal` section yet, `ConfigService` copies `terminal_backend` → `terminal.backend` and `herdr_session` → `terminal.herdr_session` into `settings.json` and logs the move once. `config.json` is left on disk untouched but is no longer read afterward — it is deprecated.
