## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Profiles tab in the Web UI: browse, search, create (from template with live
  preview, or from scratch via a schema-driven form), edit, clone, and delete
  agent profiles over the profile management APIs, with validate-before-save
  surfacing bounded findings and the truncation-marker contract (#510)

### Fixed

- **enabling `CAO_MEMORY_API_URL` rejected memory keys that work without it.**
  The `/internal/memory/store` and `/forget` routes validated the wire `key` as
  the strict `MemoryKey` (`^[a-z0-9-]{1,60}$`), while the MCP tools have always
  let `MemoryService._sanitize_key` normalise it — so `memory_store(key="Prefer
  Pytest")` stored `preferpytest` in-process and 422'd through the gateway.

- **an unreadable `settings.json` reported itself as "self-learning is
  disabled".** `settings_service._load()` gated on `Path.exists()`, which returns
  False on a `PermissionError` from the parent directory — silently, with no log
  line — and swallowed every other read error, so a filesystem fault resolved to
  a configuration message. Learning still fails closed, but `/outcomes` now
  answers 503 when the file cannot be read, `GET /settings/memory` reports
  `settings_readable`, and the tools surface it as a plain `error` rather than a
  `disabled` payload that `skills/cao-learning` instructs agents to skip silently.

- **`report_outcome` and `list_outcomes` opened SQLite in the agent's own
  process**, so they failed for any agent that does not share a filesystem with
  cao-server — and unlike the memory tools they have no `CAO_MEMORY_API_URL` path,
  so configuration could not work around it. Both now call the existing
  `POST`/`GET /outcomes` routes.

- **the MCP server's terminal lookup did not carry the internal bearer token.**
  `GET /terminals/{id}` is scope-gated, so with auth enabled it 401'd, the
  terminal context resolved to `None`, and memory scope silently collapsed to
  global. A transport or auth failure now propagates instead of being reported as
  a missing terminal identity.

- **built-in memory plugins created the server's database directory inside every
  agent process.** They are discovered through `cao.plugins` entry points and that
  discovery runs at MCP-server import, so their module-level `clients.database`
  import executed its import-time `DB_DIR.mkdir()` in agents — and failed outright
  wherever the data dir is unreadable. The import is now lazy.

### Changed

- `list_outcomes` clamps `limit` to 200 client-side; the service already clamped
  silently, so `limit=500` keeps working rather than becoming a 422.


## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- MiniMax Code (`mcode`) provider with per-terminal authentication and profile
  isolation, model and MCP configuration, multi-turn TUI orchestration,
  supervisor/worker E2E coverage, and provider documentation (#624)
- Oh My Pi (`omp`) provider with additive native configuration, profile MCP extension wiring, lifecycle detection, and supervisor/worker orchestration support (#559)
- Add the official xAI Grok Build CLI as the `grok_cli` provider, including
  isolated per-terminal MCP configuration, native hard tool restrictions,
  multi-turn TUI support, orchestration e2e coverage, and provider docs.
- async run submit, discovery, and live event following (#505) (#525)

- rewrite the cao tui front door in Rust (#547)

- worktree_service.py + use_worktree on handoff/assign (Phase 1 of #100) (#495)

- group/metadata fields + list_siblings discovery tool (#432) (#433)

- add profile frontmatter validation and schema endpoints (#575)

- apply the new CAO logo across the docs site, READMEs, and dashboard (#686)

- frozen execution manifest, plan approval, and frozen run memory (#583 Bolt 2) (#650)

- Add `cao agent assign|handoff|send-message|status|result|cancel` CLI
  commands as a fallback for in-session MCP orchestration when a terminal's
  `cao-mcp-server` connection is unavailable. Same behavior as the
  `assign`/`handoff`/`send_message`/`delete_terminal` MCP tools, backed by a
  shared `utils/orchestration` implementation module so neither entry point
  can drift from the other (#616)


### Changed

- drop the _origin_authority wrapper, document when the scheme guard applies (#669)


### Documentation

- stop the documented unit-test command from selecting e2e tests (#679)

- add a contributor blog to the documentation site (#685)


### Fixed

- `list_sessions` no longer issues one terminal query per tmux session, and both terminal reads now state their oldest-first order instead of inheriting it. The per-session `list_terminals_by_session` call inside ownership enrichment cost a query per session on a path that `GET /sessions` and the fleet snapshot both poll; it is now a single read bounded to the live sessions, so the cost scales with the sessions being listed rather than with the whole terminals table (rows for sessions tmux no longer reports accumulate, because `cleanup_service.cleanup_old_data` only runs at server startup). The ordering half matters because **a session's first terminal is normally its conductor** (index 0 is its oldest surviving row; if the conductor's own terminal is deleted, the oldest remaining worker takes that slot) and five consumers depend on it: `list_sessions` reports the earliest terminal carrying an `agent_profile` or `working_directory` as the session's owner (#497), `cao session status` and `cao session list` label it the Conductor over HTTP, flow recycling decides whether to kill a session by whether it is busy, and the fleet-panel example sends messages to it. That order was previously implicit in SQLite's row layout, so adding an index — the obvious reaction to a slow per-session lookup — could have silently changed which terminal a session advertised as its owner, and ordering by the terminal `id` (a `uuid4` prefix) would have made it a random one outright. Both reads now order by insertion, which is creation order. Swallowed-exception logs on this path also keep their tracebacks, so a database or pane failure is diagnosable from the log instead of only by reproducing it (#629)

- kiro_cli no longer passes `--legacy-ui`, which silently disabled every MCP tool. The flag is mutually exclusive with the `--agent-engine=v2` CAO pins (kiro-cli exits with `Conflicting options: --legacy-ui cannot be used with --agent-engine=v2`), and on its own it implicitly selects the **v1 agent engine, which exposes no MCP tools to the model**. Since CAO's whole orchestration surface (`assign`, `handoff`, `report_outcome`, `list_outcomes`, `store_lesson`) is delivered over MCP, affected agents started cleanly — the MCP server still booted and logged `✓ cao-mcp-server loaded` — and then reported "no such tool" for everything CAO gave them. Observed as a silent 7-day self-learning outage before the flag combination began erroring outright. The startup consent dialog `--legacy-ui` used to suppress is auto-answered after launch instead (#557), so nothing is lost by dropping it. Also removes the `--legacy-ui` retry on startup timeout: a "successful" retry would land on the MCP-less engine, turning a loud timeout into an agent that looks healthy and cannot orchestrate, so initialization now raises. `--legacy-ui` is correspondingly no longer a probed wrapper capability, which additionally unblocks wrappers that do not advertise it
- tmux listing parse failures are retried once and reported as a distinct condition instead of surfacing as a bare `ValueError` that reads like "session not found" one layer up. libtmux 0.53.1+ zips `parse_output`'s fields with `strict=True`, so any short row (a pane or session vanishing mid-listing, or trailing fields tmux omits) raised `ValueError: zip() argument 2 is shorter than argument 1` — which propagated through `server.sessions`/`window.panes`, blocked launches outright, and left the pipe-liveness watchdog unable to tell a genuinely-gone session from a transient parse failure. Adds `TmuxLookupError` and routes the listing reads in `clients/tmux.py` through a single retry-and-classify wrapper; a failed `create_session` no longer leaves an orphaned tmux session that blocks relaunching the same name. Also caps `libtmux<0.53.1`, the last release that zips non-strict (caom-anv)
- Codex handoff extraction now skips native TUI activity cells without relying on an English verb allowlist, including when the model's reply starts with prose (#545)
- `list_sessions` ownership metadata now persists the effective canonical launch directory, stays stable after pane `cd`, and purges stale terminal rows before same-name session relaunches so reused sessions report the new directory/profile (#497)
- make session teardown atomic so tmux and the terminal registry can no longer diverge (#498). `delete_session` previously trusted a pre-loop liveness reading and an unverified `kill_session` result, so a session could survive while its registry rows were deleted (orphaned tmux session) or vice versa (ghost rows that later misattributed a reused session name). Now: session creation and session teardown are mutually exclusive per session *name* (a concurrent launch can no longer interleave with a teardown of the same name), `kill_session` returns True only once the session is confirmed gone, and registry rows are deleted only *after* that confirmation. **Error-contract change:** a teardown whose tmux kill cannot be confirmed now raises (surfaced as HTTP 500 on `DELETE /sessions/{name}`) instead of reporting success — the registry rows are left intact and the operation is safe to re-run, which reconciles the survivor. Backend authors: `TerminalBackend.kill_session` must not return True for a merely-dispatched kill

- install a host Python in build-wheels so the post-build wheel assertion can run at all
  (the macOS runners ship only `python3`, so `python scripts/build_tui.py check` exited 127)

- set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET per matrix leg so delocate's minimum-OS check matches the Rust
  binary's actual floor instead of cibuildwheel's 10.9 default

- stop building and requiring a Windows wheel, and refuse Windows at import with an
  explanation: four modules import `fcntl` at module scope and the backend is tmux, so the
  sdist fallback installed but could not import

- stop building and requiring a macOS x86_64 (Intel) wheel: `cryptography` ships no
  Intel-macOS wheel at 49.0.0 or above, and CAO floors at `cryptography>=50.0.0` for two HIGH
  CVEs, so an Intel Mac cannot resolve its dependencies from wheels at all. Intel Macs now get
  a clean "no matching distribution" from pip rather than a wheel that installs and then fails.
  Every wheel CAO publishes is now both built and executed by CI.
