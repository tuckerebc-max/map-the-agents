title: Sandbox & Approvals
description: Control what local commands can do and when Open Interpreter asks first.
---

Open Interpreter has two separate safety controls:

- Sandbox mode controls the technical boundary for local command execution.
- Approval policy controls when the agent pauses and asks you.

Use `/permissions` in the TUI to inspect or change the active posture.

## Sandbox Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
| ---- | -------- |
| `read-only` | Commands can inspect allowed files but cannot write. |
| `workspace-write` | Commands can write inside the active workspace roots. Network is off unless enabled. |
| `danger-full-access` | No local sandbox boundary. Use only in an environment you intentionally trust. |

Set a default:

```toml
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
```

Override once:

```bash
interpreter --sandbox read-only "audit the auth flow"
```

## Approval Policies

| Policy | Behavior |
| ------ | -------- |
| `untrusted` | Ask before actions that could change state. |
| `on-request` | Run inside the sandbox and ask before escalation. |
| `never` | Do not ask. The sandbox is the only guardrail. |

```toml
approval_policy = "on-request"
```

`--yolo` and `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` remove both approval
prompts and sandboxing. Use them only inside an external sandbox such as a
throwaway VM or isolated container.

## Workspace Write

Grant extra writable roots for a session:

```bash
interpreter --add-dir ../shared-lib
```

Enable network for the older workspace-write sandbox:

```toml
[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = true
```

For precise network allowlists, use [Permissions](/docs/permissions).

## Protected Paths

Even inside writable roots, sensitive control directories such as `.git/` and
agent configuration directories should be treated as protected. If the agent
needs to change them, review the request closely.

## Operating System Enforcement

Open Interpreter uses the same local sandbox architecture as the Codex CLI
surface:

| Platform | Enforcement model |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| macOS | Seatbelt profiles. |
| Linux / WSL | Bubblewrap, seccomp, and related kernel sandboxing where available. |
| Windows | Native Windows sandboxing where configured; WSL uses the Linux model. |

When a requested policy cannot be enforced, Open Interpreter should fail closed
rather than silently running unsandboxed.

## Recommended Defaults

| Situation | Suggested settings |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| Inspecting unfamiliar code | `sandbox_mode = "read-only"`, `approval_policy = "on-request"` |
| Day-to-day trusted repo work | `workspace-write` plus `on-request` |
| CI in an isolated runner | `workspace-write` plus `never` |
| Disposable full-access environment | `danger-full-access` plus `never` |

If you are unsure, start with workspace-write and on-request.
