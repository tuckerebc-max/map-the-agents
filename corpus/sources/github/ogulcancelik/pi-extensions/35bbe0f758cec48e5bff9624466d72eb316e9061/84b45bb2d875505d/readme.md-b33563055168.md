# pi extensions

Extensions for [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi), the terminal-based coding agent.

This is my working collection rather than a single polished suite. Some extensions are part of my daily setup, some are occasional tools, and others are experiments I may change or stop using. The table is sorted roughly by how actively I use them.
