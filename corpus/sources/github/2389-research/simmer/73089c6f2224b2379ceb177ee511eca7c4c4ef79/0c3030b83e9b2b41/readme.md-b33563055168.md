# Simmer

You wrote a prompt. It works. But is it *good*? Simmer runs your artifact through multiple rounds of criteria-driven refinement — each round, a panel of judges reads your code, understands the problem, and proposes specific improvements.

[Read the story behind Simmer →](https://2389.ai/posts/simmer-skill/)

Iterative artifact refinement — take any artifact or workspace and hone it over multiple rounds using criteria-driven feedback.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add 2389-research/claude-plugins
/plugin install simmer@2389-research
```

## What This Plugin Provides

One skill (`simmer`) with four subskills that run the refinement loop:

- **Setup** — identify the artifact (file or workspace), elicit 2-3 quality criteria, determine evaluation method
- **Generator** — produce an improved version based on the judge's ASI (Actionable Side Information — the single highest-leverage fix)
- **Judge** — score the candidate 1-10 per criterion, produce the ASI
- **Reflect** — record the trajectory, track the best candidate across iterations

## Trigger Phrases

Say any of these to start a simmer loop:

> "simmer this", "refine this", "hone this", "iterate on this", "make this better", "improve this over a few rounds", "polish this", "tighten this up", "optimize this pipeline", "find the best model for this task", "tune this configuration"

Any request to **iteratively improve** an artifact triggers simmer.

## When to Use Simmer vs. Cookoff vs. Omakase-Off

| Situation | Use | Why |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| You have an artifact and want it better | **simmer** | Iterative refinement against criteria |
| You want parallel code implementations competing | **cookoff** | Parallel generation + fixed criteria + pick winner |
| You don't know what you want yet | **omakase-off** | Parallel designs + react + discover preference |

**Rule of thumb:** Simmer = serial iteration. Cookoff/omakase-off = parallel exploration.

## Quick Example: Single File

```
User: "Simmer this" [pastes a pitch email]

Claude: I'm using the simmer skill to set up iterative refinement.

What does "better" mean for this? I'd suggest:
1. Value prop clarity
2. Tone match
3. Call to action strength

User: "Those work"

[Iteration 0: Judge scores seed — 4.0/10]
[Iteration 1: Generator fixes value prop → 5.3/10]
[Iteration 2: Generator fixes CTA → 6.3/10]
[Iteration 3: Generator fixes tone → 7.3/10]

Trajectory:
| Iter | Value Prop | Tone | CTA | Composite | Key Change |
|------|-----------|------|-----|-----------|------------|
| 0    | 4         | 5    | 3   | 4.0       | seed       |
| 1    | 7         | 5    | 4   | 5.3       | specific problem statement |
| 2    | 7         | 6    | 6   | 6.3       | low-friction CTA |
| 3    | 7         | 7    | 8   | 7.3       | peer-sharing tone |

Best candidate: iteration 3 (7.3/10)
3 iterations complete. Run 3 more?
```

## Quick Example: Workspace with Evaluator

```
User: "Simmer this pipeline — find the best setup for this task"

Claude inspects the workspace, finds evaluate.sh and config.json,
and proposes criteria + evaluation method:

  Evaluator: ./evaluate.sh
  Criteria: accuracy, cost efficiency, latency
  Search space: models, prompt text, pipeline topology

User: "Looks good, coverage is the priority. 5 iterations."

[Iteration 0: Run evaluator on seed, judge scores — 3.7/10]
[Iteration 1: Generator swaps to cheaper model → 5.3/10]
[Iteration 2: Generator splits into 2-step chain → 7.0/10]
[Iteration 3: Generator adds few-shot examples → 7.7/10]
...

Best candidate: iteration 4 (8.1/10)
```

## Works On Anything

| Artifact type | Suggested criteria |
|---|---|
| Document / spec | clarity, completeness, actionability |
| Creative writing | narrative tension, specificity, voice consistency |
| Email / comms | value prop clarity, tone match, call to action strength |
| Prompt / instructions | instruction precision, output predictability, edge case coverage |
| API design | contract completeness, developer ergonomics, consistency |
| Pipeline / workflow | coverage, efficiency, noise |
| Configuration / infra | correctness, resource efficiency, maintainability |

## Evaluation Modes

| Mode | When to use |
|------|------------|
| **Judge-only** (default) | Text artifacts — judge scores against criteria |
| **Runnable** | Code/pipelines — judge interprets script output |
| **Hybrid** | Both — run script AND judge results against criteria |

No format contract on evaluator output. The judge reads whatever your script produces — test results, metrics, error logs, anything.

## Judge Board

Simmer auto-selects between a single judge and a multi-judge board based on complexity:

- **Simple** (short email, tweet, ≤2 criteria) → single judge, fast
- **Complex** (3 criteria, long artifact, code, pipelines) → judge board with deliberation

The board constructs three judges tailored to your specific problem — not from a fixed menu, but by reading your artifact, criteria, and constraints and designing judges with diverse perspectives. An extraction prompt gets different judges than a DND adventure hook.

Judges investigate before scoring — they read the evaluator script, ground truth, prior candidates, and config files to understand the problem deeply. A judge who reads the evaluator discovers scoring mechanics on iteration 0 instead of learning them through 3 iterations of trial and error.

If a single-judge run hits a plateau (3 iterations without improvement), simmer offers to upgrade to the board mid-run with 2 extra iterations.


## Defaults and Safety

**Default iteration count:** 3 rounds per batch. After each batch, simmer asks whether to continue. You can request a specific count ("simmer this for 10 rounds") or stop early at any prompt.

**Regression safety:** The reflect subskill tracks the best candidate seen so far. If a new iteration scores lower than the current best, the best-so-far is preserved — the loop never loses progress. At the end, `result.md` always contains the highest-scoring candidate, not just the latest one.

## Advanced Features

| Feature | When you need it |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Workspace targets** | Refining a multi-file directory — iterations tracked as git commits so you can diff any two rounds |
| **Runnable evaluators** | Your artifact has a test script — point simmer at it (`python evaluate.py`) and the judge interprets output |
| **Background constraints** | The generator needs to know what's available (models, budget, latency targets) to make realistic choices |
| **Output contracts** | Valid output has a defined shape (e.g., JSON schema) — violations score 1/10, forcing format fixes first |
| **Validation commands** | A cheap pre-check (`./validate.sh`) catches broken pipelines in seconds before the full evaluator runs |
| **Search space tracking** | Explicit bounds on what to explore — reflect tracks tried vs. untried regions so the judge steers toward gaps |

See the [v2 design spec](./docs/specs/2026-03-16-simmer-v2-design.md) for full details on each feature.

## Output Directory Structure

**Single-file mode** (default output dir: `docs/simmer`):
```
docs/simmer/
  iteration-0-candidate.md     # Seed (original artifact)
  iteration-1-candidate.md     # Each improved candidate
  iteration-2-candidate.md
  iteration-3-candidate.md
  trajectory.md                # Running score table
  result.md                    # Final best candidate (highest score, not necessarily latest)
```

**Workspace mode:**
```
./pipeline/                    # Target directory (modified in place)
  [project files]              # Tracked via git commits per iteration

docs/simmer/                   # Tracking files (separate from workspace)
  trajectory.md                # Running score table
```

Workspace iterations are tracked as git commits rather than separate files.

## How It Works

- **Focused improvement** — each iteration targets one direction (the ASI), not everything at once. Compound gains over scattered edits.
- **Context isolation** — generator doesn't see scores, judge doesn't see previous scores. Each role gets only the context it needs to avoid bias.
- **The generator is the search strategy** — in workspace mode, the generator decides what to change (swap a model, restructure a pipeline, tune a prompt). The ASI guides direction, the generator executes.

See the [design spec](./docs/specs/2026-03-16-simmer-v2-design.md) for the full architecture.
