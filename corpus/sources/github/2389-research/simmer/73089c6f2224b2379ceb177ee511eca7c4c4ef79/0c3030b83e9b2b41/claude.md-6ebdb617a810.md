# Simmer Plugin

## Overview

Simmer is an iterative refinement skill. It takes any artifact — a single file, a workspace of multiple files, a pipeline, a configuration — and hones it repeatedly against user-defined criteria. Evaluation can be subjective (judge-based), objective (runnable script), or hybrid (both).

## Skills Included

| Skill | Triggers | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `simmer` | "simmer this", "refine this", "hone this", "iterate on this", "optimize this pipeline" | Orchestrator: setup → loop → output |

### Subskills (invoked by orchestrator)

| Subskill | Role |
|----------|------|
| `simmer:simmer-setup` | Identify artifact (file or workspace), elicit criteria, determine evaluation method, produce setup brief |
| `simmer:simmer-generator` | Produce improved candidate from current + ASI feedback + background context |
| `simmer:simmer-judge` | Score candidate 1-10 per criterion (with optional evaluator output), produce ASI |
| `simmer:simmer-judge-board` | Multi-judge panel with deliberation — drop-in replacement for simmer-judge when JUDGE_MODE is board |
| `simmer:simmer-reflect` | Record trajectory, track best-so-far, pass ASI forward |

## Flow

```
"Simmer this" / "Refine this" / "Optimize this pipeline"
    ↓
Setup (identify artifact + criteria + evaluation method)
    ↓
Iteration 0: Evaluate the seed
    ↓
Loop N times:
  Generate (address ASI) → Evaluate (run evaluator if present) → Judge (score + new ASI) → Reflect (record)
    ↓
Output best candidate + trajectory
```

## Key Design Decisions

**Context discipline:** Generator doesn't see scores (avoids optimizing for numbers). Judge doesn't see intermediate scores (avoids anchoring). Reflect is the only subskill that sees the full trajectory.

**Seed calibration:** Judge receives the seed artifact + iteration-0 scores on every iteration as a fixed calibration reference. Can score above or below the seed. This compresses score variance across runs.

**ASI (Actionable Side Information):** Judge identifies the highest-leverage direction each round. For single-file targets, this is a single focused fix. For workspace targets, this is a single strategic direction that may involve coordinated changes across multiple files. Focused directional improvement compounds better than scattered edits.

**Pluggable evaluation:** Three modes — judge-only (default, subjective criteria), runnable (script/command output), or hybrid (both). No format contract on evaluator output — the judge interprets whatever the evaluator produces.

**Regression handling:** Reflect tracks best-so-far. If an iteration regresses, next generator receives the best candidate, not the regressed one. In workspace mode, this means git checkout to the best iteration's commit.

**Judge board:** For complex artifacts, the board constructs problem-specific judges that investigate before scoring — reading the evaluator script, ground truth, prior candidates, and config to understand the problem before proposing improvements. Judges are composed once per run, tailored to the specific problem, then reuse for all iterations with updated context. Tracks stable wins (WORKING/NOT WORKING) across iterations to prevent undoing proven improvements.


## Artifact Modes

| Mode | Artifact Type | Tracking |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Single-file** (default) | One file or pasted text | `iteration-N-candidate.md` files |
| **Workspace** | Directory with multiple files | Git commits per iteration |

## Evaluation Modes

| Mode | When to use | How it works |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **Judge-only** (default) | Text artifacts, design docs, creative writing | Judge scores against criteria descriptions |
| **Runnable** | Code, pipelines, configs with test suites | Judge runs command, interprets output alongside criteria |
| **Hybrid** | Pipelines with both metrics and subjective quality | Judge runs command AND scores output against criteria |

## Artifact Output

**Single-file mode:**
```
{OUTPUT_DIR}/                    # Default: docs/simmer
  iteration-0-candidate.md      # Seed
  iteration-1-candidate.md      # Each improved candidate
  iteration-2-candidate.md
  iteration-3-candidate.md
  trajectory.md                 # Running score table
  result.md                     # Final best output
```

**Workspace mode:**
```
{WORKSPACE}/                    # The target directory (modified in place)
  [project files]               # Tracked via git commits per iteration

{OUTPUT_DIR}/
  trajectory.md                 # Running score table
```
