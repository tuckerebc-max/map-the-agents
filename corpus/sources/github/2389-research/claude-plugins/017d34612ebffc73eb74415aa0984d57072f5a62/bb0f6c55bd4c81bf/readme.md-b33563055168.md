# 2389 Research Claude Code Plugin Marketplace

28 plugins and MCP servers for Claude Code — parallel exploration, iterative refinement, binary reverse engineering, structured decision-making, and more.

Built by the team at [2389](https://2389.ai). These are the tools we use every day.

**Browse the marketplace:** https://2389-research.github.io/claude-plugins

## Quick Start

Install any plugin in **any agent** (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, …) with [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):

```bash
npx skills add 2389-research/simmer
```

Or natively in Claude Code:

```bash
# Add the marketplace, then install any plugin
/plugin marketplace add 2389-research/claude-plugins
/plugin install simmer@2389-research
```

> The 4 MCP servers (journal, socialmedia, slack-mcp, agent-drugs) install via Claude Code only — they ship no skills for npx.
