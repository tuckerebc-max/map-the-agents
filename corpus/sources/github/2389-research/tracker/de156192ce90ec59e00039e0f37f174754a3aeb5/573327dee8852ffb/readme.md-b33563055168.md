# Tracker by 2389

Pipeline orchestration engine for multi-agent LLM workflows. Define pipelines in `.dip` files (Dippin, our pipeline DSL), execute them with parallel agents, and watch progress in a TUI dashboard.

Built by [2389.ai](https://2389.ai). **[Docs, walkthroughs & the TUI in action →](https://2389-research.github.io/tracker/)**

## Quick Start

**Install** — Homebrew (macOS/Linux) or `go install`:

```bash
brew install 2389-research/tap/tracker
# or:  go install github.com/2389-research/tracker/cmd/tracker@latest
```

**Three steps to your first run** — no `.dip` file needed:

```bash
tracker doctor            # 1. check setup: API keys, dippin binary, working dir
tracker ask_and_execute   # 2. run a built-in workflow: describe what you want, answer one gate, watch it build
tracker diagnose          # 3. inspect what happened (also: tracker audit / tracker list)
```

From there:

- **Bring a spec** — `tracker init build_product` scaffolds `build_product.dip` + a starter `SPEC.md`; edit the spec, then `tracker build_product`.
- **Hands-off** — add `--autopilot mid` to replace human gates with an LLM judge (or `--auto-approve` for deterministic approval).
- **Drive it elsewhere** — from [Slack](cmd/trackerbot/README.md) (`trackerbot`) or your [terminal as a REPL](cmd/trackerchat/README.md) (`trackerchat`).
- **Explore** — `tracker workflows` (list built-ins), `tracker validate <wf>`, `tracker simulate <wf>`, `tracker estimate <wf>`, `tracker setup`, `tracker --help`.

> **Release history has moved out of this README** — see **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** for what's new in each version, and the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for what's next.

## Pipeline Examples

Four pipelines are embedded in the binary and available via `tracker workflows`:

### `ask_and_execute`
Competitive implementation: ask the user what to build, fan out to 3 agents (Claude/Codex/Gemini) in isolated git worktrees, cross-critique the implementations, select the best one, apply it, clean up the rest.

### `build_product`
Sequential milestone builder: read a SPEC.md, decompose into milestones, implement each with verification loops (opus-powered fix agent with 50 turns), cross-review the complete result, verify full spec compliance. Context-specific escalation gates let you override flaky tests or skip milestones without aborting the build.

```mermaid
graph LR
    ReadSpec --> Decompose --> ApprovePlan
    ApprovePlan -->|approve| PickNext
    PickNext -->|milestone N| Implement --> Test
    Test -->|pass| Verify --> MarkDone --> PickNext
    Test -->|fail| Fix --> Test
    Test -->|escalate| EscalateMilestone
    EscalateMilestone -->|mark done| MarkDone
    EscalateMilestone -->|retry| Implement
    PickNext -->|all done| CrossReview --> FinalBuild --> FinalSpec --> Cleanup --> Done
```

### `build_product_with_superspec`
Parallel stream execution for large structured specs: reads the spec's work streams and dependency graph, executes independent streams in parallel (with git worktree isolation), enforces quality gates between phases, cross-reviews with 3 specialized reviewers (architect/QA/product), and audits traceability.

#### Which one? `build_product` vs `build_product_with_superspec`

Start with **`build_product`** — it is the default for a normal `SPEC.md`. It builds one milestone at a time in a single working tree, which keeps the run easy to follow and cheaper to escalate. Reach for **`build_product_with_superspec`** only when the spec is large enough to name **independent work streams and a dependency graph** the engine can parallelize; on a small or single-track spec its extra machinery is overhead with no payoff.

Both run the same `SpecLint` spec-coherence preflight before any decomposition (dangling refs, contradictory constants, contract/signature mismatch, unassignable mandated tests — fail-closed). Everything below is **superspec-only**:

- **Parallel work streams** dispatched from the spec's stream/dependency graph, each in an **isolated git worktree**, instead of a sequential milestone loop.
- **Per-phase mechanical quality gates** (build, test, lint, coverage, complexity) between stream phases — mechanical, not LLM-judged.
- **Three specialized cross-reviewers** (architect / QA / product) rather than the base cross-review.
- **`docs/traceability.yaml` scaffold** plus a final **`TraceabilityAudit` goal gate** that verifies every spec requirement maps to implementation and test coverage.

The two workflows are separate embedded files, not a base-plus-overlay; the shared `SpecLint` node is deliberately duplicated (built-in delivery cannot resolve subgraph file refs) and pinned byte-identical by a parity test (issue #307).

### `deep_review`
Interview-driven codebase review: describe what you want reviewed, answer structured interview questions to scope the analysis, then three parallel agents analyze correctness, security, and design. A second interview presents findings for your context (is this intentional? known issue?), a third prioritizes remediation, and the pipeline produces an actionable remediation plan.

```mermaid
graph LR
    DescribeGoal --> Explore --> ScopeInterview
    ScopeInterview --> AnalyzeParallel
    AnalyzeParallel --> Correctness & Security & Design
    Correctness & Security & Design --> Join
    Join --> Synthesize --> FindingsInterview
    FindingsInterview --> PriorityInterview
    PriorityInterview --> RemediationPlan --> ReviewPlan
    ReviewPlan -->|approve| Finalize --> Done
    ReviewPlan -->|revise| RemediationPlan
```

## Built-in Workflows

Pipelines are embedded in the binary so `brew` and `go install` users can run them without cloning the repo:

```bash
tracker workflows              # List all built-in workflows
tracker ask_and_execute        # Run directly by name — no files needed
tracker validate build_product # Validate works too
tracker simulate build_product # Simulate too
tracker init build_product     # Copy .dip + scaffold a starter SPEC.md for editing
```

`build_product` builds from a `SPEC.md` in the repo root; running it without one
exits with a pointer to `tracker init build_product`, which scaffolds both the
`.dip` and a starter `SPEC.md` so the first run succeeds.

Local `.dip` files always take precedence over built-ins. After `tracker init build_product`, running `tracker build_product` uses your local copy.

## Dippin Language

Pipelines are defined in `.dip` files using the [Dippin language](https://github.com/2389-research/dippin-lang):

```dip
workflow MyPipeline
  goal: "Build something great"
  start: Begin
  exit: Done

  defaults
    model: claude-sonnet-5
    provider: anthropic

  agent Begin
    label: Start

  human AskUser
    label: "What should we build?"
    mode: freeform

  agent Implement
    label: "Build It"
    prompt: |
      The user wants: ${ctx.human_response}
      Implement it following the project's conventions.

  agent Done
    label: Done

  edges
    Begin -> AskUser
    AskUser -> Implement
    Implement -> Done
```

### Declaring Environmental Dependencies — `requires:` (v0.29.0)

Workflows can declare what they need from the host environment with a `requires:` line in the header:

```dip
workflow BuildProduct
  goal: "..."
  requires: git
  start: Start
  exit: Done
```

Tracker checks these at startup (when you invoke `tracker <workflow>`). If the env doesn't satisfy them, the run fails in seconds with a copy-paste remediation instead of burning LLM spend before the first failure. Override per-run with `--git=auto|off|warn|require|init` (default `auto` respects `requires:`; `--git=init --allow-init` auto-initializes the workdir, with safety refusals for `$HOME`, `/`, and nested repos — including bare repos, linked worktrees, and submodules). v0.29.0 implements `git`; unrecognized entries warn and continue so workflow authors can forward-declare deps that future tracker versions will check.

### Node Types

| Type | Shape | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `agent` | box | LLM agent session (codergen) |
| `human` | hexagon | Human-in-the-loop gate (choice, freeform, or hybrid) |
| `tool` | parallelogram | Shell command execution |
| `parallel` | component | Fan-out to concurrent branches |
| `fan_in` | tripleoctagon | Join parallel branches |
| `subgraph` | tab | Execute a referenced sub-pipeline |
| `manager_loop` | house | Managed iteration loop |
| `conditional` | diamond | Condition-based routing |

### Variable Interpolation

Three namespaces for `${...}` syntax in prompts:

- `${ctx.outcome}` — runtime pipeline context (outcome, last_response, human_response, tool_stdout)
- `${params.model}` — workflow-level `vars` (optionally overridden by `--param key=value` at run time, v0.19.0) and subgraph parameters passed from a parent pipeline
- `${graph.goal}` — workflow-level attributes

Declare defaults in a top-level `vars` block and override them per-run:

```dip
workflow MyPipeline
  vars
    model: claude-sonnet-5
    retries: 3
```

```bash
tracker --param model=claude-opus-5 --param retries=1 MyPipeline
```

Unknown `--param` keys hard-fail at startup. Dippin-lang's lint (run automatically at .dip load) flags undeclared `${params.*}` references and other variable-reference mistakes — see `dippin doctor` for the full lint catalog.

Variables are expanded in a single pass — resolved values are never re-scanned, preventing recursive expansion.

**Important**: Each agent node runs a fresh LLM session. Data flows between nodes via context keys, not conversation history. Per-node scoping (`${ctx.node.<nodeID>.<key>}`) lets you reference a specific earlier node's output without relying on the last-writer-wins `last_response` key. See **[Pipeline Context Flow](docs/architecture/context-flow.md)** for the full model, fidelity levels, and parallel-branch patterns.

### Edge Conditions

```dip
edges
  Check -> Pass  when ctx.outcome = success
  Check -> Fail  when ctx.outcome = fail
  Check -> Retry when ctx.outcome = retry
  Gate -> Next   when ctx.tool_stdout contains all-done
  Gate -> Loop   when ctx.tool_stdout not contains all-done
```

Supported operators: `=`, `!=`, `contains`, `not contains`, `startswith`, `not startswith`, `endswith`, `not endswith`, `in`, `not in`, `&&`, `||`, `not`.

`ctx.tool_stdout` and `ctx.tool_stderr` capture the **tail** of a tool node's output (default cap 64KB per stream, configurable per-node via `output_limit: 256KB`; `--max-output-limit` is a hard global ceiling, default 10MB, that caps how high a per-node `output_limit` can go). Routing markers emitted at end-of-output via `printf` survive truncation by construction; `tracker diagnose` surfaces a `tool_output_truncated` suggestion when a stream was clipped so you know to raise the limit if the captured tail isn't what you expected.

Conditions support the `ctx.` namespace prefix (dippin convention) and `internal.*` references for engine-managed state.

### Declarative Structured Output — `writes:` / `reads:`

Agent, tool, and `mode: interview` human nodes can declare the context keys they produce and consume (v0.21.0):

```dip
agent Planner
  response_format: json_object
  writes:
    - milestone_id
    - files
  reads:
    - spec_path
```

The node output must be a valid top-level JSON object; every declared key in `writes:` must be present or the node hard-fails. Extras are allowed (surfaced as warnings), strings are stored verbatim, non-string values are stored as compact JSON. `reads:` pins fidelity for upstream keys so downstream nodes see consistent data. See **[Pipeline Context Flow](docs/architecture/context-flow.md)** for the full contract, worked examples, and interview-mode semantics.

### Per-Node Working Directory

For git worktree isolation in parallel implementations:

```dip
agent ImplementClaude
  working_dir: .ai/worktrees/claude
  model: claude-sonnet-5
  prompt: Implement the spec in this isolated worktree.
```

The `working_dir` attribute is validated against path traversal and shell metacharacters.

### Human Gates

Five gate modes:

- **Choice mode** (default): presents outgoing edge labels as a radio list. Arrow keys navigate, Enter selects.
- **Freeform mode** (`mode: freeform`): captures text input. If the response matches an edge label (case-insensitive), it routes to that edge. Otherwise it's stored as `ctx.human_response`.
- **Hybrid mode** (automatic): when a freeform gate has labeled outgoing edges, the TUI presents a radio list of labels plus an "other" option for custom feedback. Selecting a label submits it directly; selecting "other" opens a textarea for specific instructions.
- **Yes/No mode** (`mode: yes_no`): fixed two-option prompt. Yes maps to `OutcomeSuccess`, No maps to `OutcomeFail` — route with `when ctx.outcome = success` / `when ctx.outcome = fail` edges. Distinct from choice mode, where the outcome is always success and routing uses `preferred_label`.
- **Interview mode** (`mode: interview`): structured multi-field form driven by upstream agent output. An agent generates markdown questions with inline options; the handler parses them into individual form fields and presents a fullscreen interview form. Answers are stored as JSON and markdown summary.

Long prompts with labels (e.g., escalation gates with agent output) automatically use a fullscreen **review hybrid view**: glamour-rendered scrollable viewport on top (PgUp/PgDn to scroll), radio label selection in the middle, and an "other" freeform option at the bottom for custom retry instructions. Long prompts without labels use a **split-pane review**: scrollable viewport on top, textarea on bottom.

```dip
human ApproveSpec
  label: "Review the spec. Approve, refine, or reject."
  mode: freeform

edges
  ApproveSpec -> Build  label: "approve"
  ApproveSpec -> Revise label: "refine"  restart: true
  ApproveSpec -> Done   label: "reject"
```

#### Interview Mode

Interview gates let an agent generate structured questions that the user answers via a form:

```dip
human ScopeInterview
  label: "Help us focus the review."
  mode: interview
  questions_key: interview_questions
  answers_key: scope_answers
```

The upstream agent writes markdown questions to the `questions_key` context variable. The parser extracts:
- **Numbered/bulleted questions** ending in `?` or imperative prompts ("Describe...", "List...")
- **Inline options** from trailing parentheticals: `Auth model? (API key, OAuth, JWT)` becomes a select field
- **Yes/no patterns** detected automatically as confirm toggles

The TUI presents a fullscreen form with per-field navigation (arrow keys), pagination (PgUp/PgDn for 10+ questions), elaboration textareas (Tab), and pre-fill from previous answers on retry. Answers are stored as JSON at `answers_key` and as a markdown summary at `human_response`. If zero questions are parsed, the gate falls back to freeform. Cancellation returns `outcome=fail`.

A reusable interview loop pattern is available in `examples/subgraphs/interview-loop.dip` — embed it via `subgraph` nodes with `topic` and `focus` parameters.

Submit with **Ctrl+S**. Enter inserts newlines. Esc cancels (empty) or submits (with content). Ctrl+C cancels and unblocks the pipeline (no deadlock).

### Providers

Tracker supports four LLM providers: `anthropic`, `openai`, `gemini`, and `openai-compat` (for any OpenAI-compatible API). Set up with:

```bash
# Interactive setup wizard
tracker setup

# Verify your configuration
tracker doctor
```

Keys are stored in `~/.config/2389/tracker/.env`. You can also export them directly:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

**Important**: Use `gemini` (not `google`) as the provider name in `.dip` files.

Non-retryable provider errors (quota exceeded, auth failure, model not found) immediately fail the pipeline with a clear message instead of silently retrying.

### Cloudflare AI Gateway

Tracker can route every provider through [Cloudflare AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) so you stop hitting rate limits (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc. cap per-account request rates; Cloudflare's gateway capacity is much higher), gain central analytics and caching, and enable model routing on the gateway side.

Set one env var or flag instead of four:

```bash
# The root URL of your Cloudflare AI Gateway:
#   https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/<account_id>/<gateway_slug>
export TRACKER_GATEWAY_URL="https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/acc/gw"

# API keys still go to the provider — Cloudflare just proxies.
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...

tracker build_product
```

Or as a CLI flag:

```bash
tracker --gateway-url https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/acc/gw build_product
```

Tracker automatically appends the per-provider suffix:

| Provider | Resolved URL |
|---|---|
| `anthropic` | `<gateway>/anthropic` |
| `openai` | `<gateway>/openai` |
| `gemini` | `<gateway>/google-ai-studio` |
| `openai-compat` | `<gateway>/compat` |

**Per-provider overrides still win.** If you set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` directly, Anthropic traffic goes there, and the gateway only proxies the providers you haven't explicitly overridden. This means you can point Anthropic at a self-hosted proxy while keeping OpenAI on Cloudflare with one command.

**Troubleshooting:**
- `429` from Cloudflare: something bigger is wrong (account-level limits, bad gateway slug). 429s from direct provider calls are what the gateway is meant to prevent.
- `401`: check your provider API key, not the gateway — Cloudflare passes auth through.
- Empty responses: verify the gateway slug is correct and the provider is enabled in the Cloudflare dashboard.

## Architecture

Tracker is a three-layer stack: an LLM client (provider adapters and token tracking), an agent session (turn loop, tool execution, context compaction), and a pipeline engine (graph execution, edge routing, checkpoints, decision audit, TUI). The dippin adapter converts parsed `.dip` IR into tracker's `Graph` model, and handlers implement per-node behavior.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Layer 3: Pipeline Engine"
        Engine["Graph Execution<br/>Edge Routing<br/>Checkpoints<br/>Decision Audit"]
        Handlers["Handlers: start, exit, codergen, tool,<br/>wait.human, parallel, parallel.fan_in,<br/>conditional, subgraph, stack.manager_loop"]
        Adapter["Dippin Adapter<br/>IR → Graph"]
        TUI["TUI: node list,<br/>activity log, modals"]
    end
    subgraph "Layer 2: Agent Session"
        Session["Tool Execution<br/>Context Compaction<br/>Event Streaming"]
    end
    subgraph "Layer 1: LLM Client"
        Anthropic & OpenAI & Gemini
    end
    Engine --> Handlers
    Engine --> Adapter
    Engine --> TUI
    Handlers --> Session
    Session --> Anthropic & OpenAI & Gemini
```

The core engine is **UI-agnostic**: the TUI, the Slack bot ([`trackerbot`](./cmd/trackerbot/README.md)),
the terminal REPL ([`trackerchat`](./cmd/trackerchat/README.md)), and any future
web/mobile front-end are peers on one library boundary — `tracker.Config` →
`Engine`, an `Interviewer` seam for human gates, the pipeline/agent event
streams, and `RunManager` for many concurrent runs. The Slack bot and the REPL
share one transport-neutral core (`transport/chatops`); each adds only its own
I/O. See **[`docs/architecture/transport-boundary.md`](./docs/architecture/transport-boundary.md)**.

**Declared inputs.** A workflow can declare a typed input signature (a dippin
`inputs` block, requires dippin ≥ v0.51); a front-end introspects it with
`tracker.DescribeInputs`, validates a request with `tracker.ValidateInputs`
(structured per-input errors), and passes values via `Config.Inputs`. They are
validated + bound at run start — a missing required input fails closed before
any node runs, instead of the agent proceeding with nothing. File inputs are
staged into the run dir so a workflow reads them at a fixed, safe path
(`build_product` takes its `spec` this way). **Secret inputs** (`SecretInput`)
are staged the same way — the value goes to a `0600` file and `${inputs.<name>}`
resolves to the path only, so a secret never enters a prompt, the provider wire,
the trace, or the checkpoint. See
[`docs/architecture/embedding.md` §1a](./docs/architecture/embedding.md).

For subsystem-level architecture docs, see **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** and **[`docs/architecture/`](./docs/architecture/)**.

## TUI

The terminal UI shows:

- **Pipeline panel**: node list in topological execution order (Kahn's algorithm) with status lamps, thinking spinners, and tool execution indicators
- **Activity log**: per-node streaming with line-level formatting (headers, code blocks, bullets), node change separators, multi-node activity indicators for parallel execution, and inline `FAILED:`/`RETRYING:` messages when nodes fail or retry
- **Subgraph nodes**: dynamically inserted and indented under their parent

### Status Icons

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ○ | Pending — not yet reached |
| 🟡 (spinner) | Running — LLM thinking |
| ⚡ | Running — tool executing |
| ● (green) | Completed successfully |
| ✗ (red) | Failed |
| ↻ (amber) | Retrying |
| ⊘ (dim) | Skipped — pipeline took a different path |

### Run terminal status

`tracker.Result.Status` is one of:

| Value | Meaning | `IsSuccess()` |
|---|---|---|
| `success` | Run reached the success exit; all validations passed. | true |
| `validation_overridden` | Run reached the success exit, but a human, autopilot, or webhook accepted a failed validation along the way. See `Result.ValidationOverrides`. | true |
| `budget_exceeded` | A `BudgetGuard` halted the run. | false |
| `paused_billing` | Billing/quota exhaustion halted the run in a recoverable, resumable terminal (checkpoint + preserved WIP + `tracker -r` resume). Surfaced to embedders as `RunManager.RunPaused`. | false |
| `fail` | Run halted via failure. | false |

The enum is open — future minor releases may add new values. Use `IsSuccess()` (or `status_class` in JSON output) instead of switching on the raw string.

### Keyboard

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| v | Cycle log verbosity (all / tools / errors / reasoning) |
| z | Toggle zen mode (full-width log, sidebar hidden) |
| / | Search the activity log (n/N next/prev, Esc exits) |
| ? | Help overlay with all shortcuts |
| Enter | Drill down into the selected node (Esc exits) |
| y | Copy the visible log to the clipboard |
| Ctrl+O | Toggle expand/collapse tool output |
| Ctrl+S | Submit human gate input |
| Esc | Cancel (empty) or submit (with content) |
| PgUp/PgDn | Scroll review viewport (plan approval) |
| q | Quit |

## Drive it from Slack

[`cmd/trackerbot`](./cmd/trackerbot/README.md) is a Slack front-end built on the
[transport boundary](./docs/architecture/transport-boundary.md). Mention it and
it starts a pipeline in a thread, streams notifications and clarifying gate
questions there, and delivers the result — arbitrarily many runs at once, one
per thread:

```
@trackerbot make me a CLI that greets people
@trackerbot run build_product
@trackerbot status   @trackerbot cancel   @trackerbot runs
```

Natural-language requests are routed to a workflow by an LLM; all four gate
modes (choice / yes-no / freeform / interview) work in-thread; interrupted runs
resume after a restart. It connects via Socket Mode (no public endpoint). Setup
and configuration: [`cmd/trackerbot/README.md`](./cmd/trackerbot/README.md).

## Drive it from your terminal

[`cmd/trackerchat`](./cmd/trackerchat/README.md) is the same experience as a REPL:
type a request, answer gates inline, watch the run — no Slack required. It's the
second consumer of the transport boundary, built from the same
`transport/chatops` core, so it inherits every command, gate mode, cost estimate,
and steer/bump control the Slack bot has:

```
$ trackerchat
> run ask_and_execute
❓ Which approach should I take?
   1) Minimal  [default]
   2) Full-featured
> 1
✅ done — success · $0.42 · 1m03s
```

## Decision Audit Trail

Every run produces an `activity.jsonl` log. Live writes go to the integrity-protected path under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/tracker/runs/<id>/activity.jsonl` (mode `0o600`, default `$HOME/.local/state/tracker/runs/<id>/`, override via `TRACKER_AUDIT_DIR`; #213). At run-end a sentinel-stripped snapshot is mirrored back to `.tracker/runs/<id>/activity.jsonl` for bundle export and post-run grep/jq workflows. Captured content:

- **Pipeline events**: node start/complete/fail, checkpoint saves
- **Agent events**: LLM turns, tool calls, text output
- **Decision events**: edge selection (with priority level and context snapshot), condition evaluations (with match results), node outcomes (with token counts), restart detections

**Run capture (v0.50.0).** Beyond the event stream, a finished run is reconstructable: the executed spec (`workflow.dip` + `workflow.ir.json` + input files), the verbatim provider request bodies, and per-call/turn/session identity land on every `activity.jsonl` line and roll up into a `run.json` manifest (goal, terminal status, per-node kind/attempts/outcome/turns/usage, run totals). `tracker run-json [runID]` assembles the manifest after the fact, so a SIGKILLed or archived run gets one too. Library callers wire the same capture with `Config.Capture` (v0.51.0). Capture files are written `0600` with `O_NOFOLLOW`, and `.tracker/` is excluded from exported bundles.

Reconstruct any routing decision after the fact (post-run snapshot path):

```bash
# See all edge decisions
grep 'decision_edge' .tracker/runs/<id>/activity.jsonl | python3 -m json.tool

# See condition evaluations
grep 'decision_condition' .tracker/runs/<id>/activity.jsonl | python3 -m json.tool

# See node outcomes with token counts
grep 'decision_outcome' .tracker/runs/<id>/activity.jsonl | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Git Integration

Enable git artifacts from the library via the `WithGitArtifacts(true)` option on the engine builder; the artifact run directory becomes a git repository and each terminal node outcome creates a commit. (There is no CLI flag for this today — use the `ExportBundle` helper or the `--export-bundle` CLI flag to produce a portable bundle from any run directory.)

```text
node(start): start outcome=success
node(middle): codergen outcome=success
node(end): exit outcome=success
```

Checkpoint tags (`checkpoint/<runID>/<nodeID>`) mark each save point.

### Exporting a run as a portable bundle

`ExportBundle` packages the entire git history — commits and tags — into a single file you can copy anywhere:

```go
// Library usage
result, _ := engine.Run(ctx)
if err := tracker.ExportBundle(result.ArtifactRunDir, "/tmp/run.bundle"); err != nil {
    log.Printf("bundle export failed: %v", err)
}
```

```bash
# CLI usage: export bundle after the pipeline completes
tracker --export-bundle /tmp/run.bundle examples/ask_and_execute.dip

# Restore and inspect on any machine with git
git clone /tmp/run.bundle /tmp/run
cd /tmp/run && git log --oneline
```

The bundle is self-contained — no network access needed. Clone it on another machine, inspect the exact sequence of node outcomes, and replay from any checkpoint tag.

## Troubleshooting

When a pipeline run doesn't go as expected, tracker gives you tools to understand what happened:

### `tracker diagnose`

Analyzes a run's failures and surfaces the information you need — tool stdout/stderr, error messages, timing anomalies — without manually grepping through JSONL files.

```bash
# Diagnose the most recent run
tracker diagnose

# Diagnose a specific run (prefix matching works)
tracker diagnose 7813b
```

The output shows each failed node with its output, stderr, errors, and actionable suggestions. For example, it will tell you if a tool node failed because of a stale counter file, or if a node completed suspiciously fast (suggesting a configuration issue).

### `tracker audit`

For a broader view of a run's timeline, retries, and recommendations:

```bash
# List all runs
tracker list

# Full audit report for a specific run
tracker audit <run-id>
```

### Common issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| "no LLM providers configured" | Missing API keys | `tracker setup` or export env vars |
| TestMilestone instantly escalates | Stale `fix_attempts` counter | `rm .ai/milestones/fix_attempts` |
| Node fails with no visible error | Tool stderr not surfaced | `tracker diagnose` shows full output |
| Pipeline loops forever | Unconditional fallback to loop target | Ensure fallbacks go to an exit node (Done, escalation gate), not back into the loop |
| Tool retries same error 5 times | Deterministic command bug | `tracker diagnose` flags identical retries — fix the command in the .dip file |
| Every milestone needs fixing | known_failures has comments or bad format | Ensure bare test names only, no comments — v0.11.2 strips them automatically |
| Build loop skips all milestones | Milestone headers don't match expected format | Use `## Milestone N: Title` format — v0.11.2 is flexible + fails loudly |

## Cost Governance

Tracker exposes per-provider token and dollar cost from every run, and can halt
pipelines that exceed configured ceilings.

**Library consumers** read cost via `Result.Cost`:

```go
result, _ := tracker.Run(ctx, source, tracker.Config{
    Budget: pipeline.BudgetLimits{
        MaxTotalTokens: 100_000,
        MaxCostCents:   500,           // $5.00
        MaxWallTime:    30 * time.Minute,
    },
})
// IsSuccess() returns true for {success, validation_overridden}; classify by
// status_class for stable bucketing across future enum extensions.
if !result.Status.IsSuccess() {
    log.Printf("run did not complete cleanly: status=%s, spent $%.4f",
        result.Status, result.Cost.TotalUSD)
}
// To branch on overrides specifically:
if len(result.ValidationOverrides) > 0 {
    log.Printf("run involved %d override(s)", len(result.ValidationOverrides))
}
for provider, pc := range result.Cost.ByProvider {
    log.Printf("%s: %d tokens, $%.4f", provider, pc.Usage.InputTokens+pc.Usage.OutputTokens, pc.USD)
}
```

**CLI users** pass flags directly to `tracker`:

```bash
tracker --max-tokens 100000 --max-cost 500 --max-wall-time 30m \
    examples/ask_and_execute.dip
```

A halted run prints a `HALTED: budget exceeded` section naming the dimension
that tripped. Run `tracker diagnose` to see the per-provider breakdown and
remediation guidance.

**Streaming consumers** subscribe to `EventCostUpdated` via
`tracker.Config.EventHandler`. Each terminal-node outcome emits a
`CostSnapshot` with aggregate tokens, dollar cost, per-provider totals,
and wall-clock elapsed time.

Budget ceilings can also be declared inline in the workflow's `defaults:` block (v0.19.0) and act as the fallback when neither `Config.Budget` nor the matching `--max-*` CLI flags are set:

```dip
workflow MyPipeline
  defaults
    model: claude-sonnet-5
    max_total_tokens: 100000
    max_cost_cents:   500
    max_wall_time:    30m
```

Explicit library/CLI values still win over the `.dip` defaults.

## Headless Execution (Webhook Gate)

`--webhook-url` enables fully headless operation: instead of pausing the pipeline to wait for a human at a terminal, tracker POSTs every human gate as JSON to your URL and waits for a callback.

This is the integration point for Slack bots, email approval flows, mobile push notifications, factory workers, or any custom approval system.

### Flow

1. A human gate fires → tracker POSTs a `WebhookGatePayload` to `--webhook-url`.
2. Your service receives the payload, routes it to a human (Slack message, email, etc.).
3. The human responds → your service POSTs a `WebhookGateResponse` to the `callback_url` field.
4. Tracker resumes the pipeline with the human's answer.

### CLI

```bash
tracker --webhook-url https://factory.example.com/api/gate \
        --gate-timeout 30m \
        --gate-timeout-action fail \
        --webhook-auth "Bearer sk_live_..." \
        examples/build_product.dip
```

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--webhook-url` | _(required to enable)_ | URL to POST gate payloads to |
| `--gate-callback-addr` | `:8789` | Local addr for the inbound callback server |
| `--gate-timeout` | `10m` | How long to wait for a reply per gate |
| `--gate-timeout-action` | `fail` | What to do on timeout: `fail` or `success` |
| `--webhook-auth` | _(empty)_ | `Authorization` header on outbound POSTs |

`--webhook-url` is mutually exclusive with `--autopilot` and `--auto-approve`.

### Payload format

Tracker POSTs JSON with this shape:

```json
{
  "gate_id": "uuid",
  "run_id": "optional-run-id",
  "node_id": "ApproveSpec",
  "prompt": "Review the spec. Approve, refine, or reject.",
  "choices": [{"label": "approve", "value": "approve"}, ...],
  "callback_url": "http://localhost:8789/gate/f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
  "timeout_seconds": 1800,
  "gate_token": "per-gate-secret"
}
```

Your service POSTs back to `callback_url` with:

```json
{
  "choice": "approve",
  "freeform": "optional free-text response",
  "reasoning": "optional explanation"
}
```

Include the `gate_token` value in the `X-Tracker-Gate-Token` header — the callback server rejects requests with missing or wrong tokens (HTTP 401).

### Library API

> ⚠️ **Stability note (pre-v1.0):** tracker's library API is usable now, but
> breaking changes may still happen between minor releases while the surface is
> finalized. Check `CHANGELOG.md` before upgrading. Full policy — the supported
> surface, the open-enum rule, and the deprecation contract — is in
> [`docs/api-stability.md`](docs/api-stability.md), mechanically guarded by an
> exported-surface golden snapshot (`api_surface_test.go`).

Library consumers set `tracker.Config.WebhookGate` instead of using CLI flags:

```go
result, _ := tracker.Run(ctx, source, tracker.Config{
    WebhookGate: &tracker.WebhookGateConfig{
        WebhookURL:    "https://factory.example.com/api/gate",
        CallbackAddr:  ":8789",
        Timeout:       30 * time.Minute,
        TimeoutAction: "fail",
        AuthHeader:    "Bearer sk_live_...",
    },
})
```

### Analyzing past runs from code

```go
import (
    "context"

    tracker "github.com/2389-research/tracker"
)

ctx := context.Background()
report, err := tracker.DiagnoseMostRecent(ctx, ".")
if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) }

for _, f := range report.Failures {
    fmt.Printf("failed: %s (handler=%s, retries=%d)\n",
        f.NodeID, f.Handler, f.RetryCount)
}
for _, s := range report.Suggestions {
    fmt.Printf("  %s: %s\n", s.Kind, s.Message)
}
```

`tracker.Audit`, `tracker.DiagnoseMostRecent`, `tracker.Simulate`, and `tracker.Doctor` all accept `context.Context` as their first argument and return JSON-serializable reports. `tracker.ListRuns` and `DiagnoseMostRecent`/`Diagnose` accept an optional config (`AuditConfig`, `DiagnoseConfig`) with a `LogWriter` for non-fatal parse warnings; if `LogWriter` is left unset, warnings are discarded, so embedded callers are silent by default. Set `LogWriter` to something like `os.Stderr` (or another writer/logger sink) if you want to receive those warnings. `Audit` and `Simulate` currently take just `ctx` (plus their payload); `Doctor` takes a required `DoctorConfig` plus optional functional options (e.g., `tracker.WithVersionInfo`).

If you currently shell out to `tracker diagnose` and scrape stdout, migrate to
`tracker.Diagnose()` / `tracker.DiagnoseMostRecent()` and read
`DiagnoseReport` directly instead of parsing formatted CLI text.

To stream events programmatically in the same NDJSON format as `tracker --json`, use `tracker.NewNDJSONWriter`:

```go
w := tracker.NewNDJSONWriter(os.Stdout)
result, _ := tracker.Run(ctx, source, tracker.Config{
    EventHandler: w.PipelineHandler(),
    AgentEvents:  w.AgentHandler(),
})
```
