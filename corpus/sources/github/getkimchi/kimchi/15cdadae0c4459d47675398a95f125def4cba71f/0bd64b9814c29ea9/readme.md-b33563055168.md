# kimchi

A coding agent CLI powered by [kimchi](https://kimchi.dev/). Built on the [pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) coding agent SDK, kimchi gives you an AI-powered development assistant in your terminal that connects to kimchi's LLM infrastructure.

## Quick start

Install the latest release:

**Homebrew (macOS / Linux):**

```bash
brew install getkimchi/tap/kimchi
```

**Install script (macOS / Linux):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/getkimchi/kimchi/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**

```powershell
irm https://github.com/getkimchi/kimchi/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then configure your API key and launch:

```bash
kimchi setup   # one-time interactive setup
kimchi         # launch the coding agent
```

Run `kimchi --help` to see all available subcommands and flags.

## Models

### Model selection

The supported model list is fetched at startup from the kimchi metadata service. Use `/model` or `ctrl+p` in the interactive CLI to switch between available models.

Kimchi operates in one of two modes:

| Mode | Status line indicator | Behavior |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Multi-model** | `multi-model (orchestrator-id)` | The orchestrator delegates each task to the model assigned for that role |
| **Single-model** | model name | All work runs on the selected model directly |

Use `ctrl+p` to cycle through models. The last entry in the cycle is `multi-model`. You can also open the `/model` picker and select a specific model or `multi-model` from the list.

In single-model mode the orchestration system prompt (environment, tools, research rules, guidelines, phase tagging) stays active, but task classification and delegation are disabled. The subagent tool remains available if you explicitly ask the agent to delegate.

### Model roles

In multi-model mode, each task type is handled by a specific role. Each role can have one model or a **pool of candidates** — the orchestrator reads model tier and description and picks the best fit for each task.

Use `/multi-model` in the interactive CLI to toggle models on/off per role, or edit `~/.config/kimchi/harness/settings.json` directly:

```json
{
  "modelRoles": {
    "orchestrator": "kimchi-dev/kimi-k2.6",
    "builder": ["kimchi-dev/minimax-m2.7", "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"],
    "reviewer": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "explorer": "kimchi-dev/nemotron-3-ultra-fp4"
  }
}
```

| Role | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **orchestrator** | `kimi-k2.6` | Runs the main loop, classifies tasks, delegates work. Single model. |
| **planner** | `kimi-k2.6` | Designs the approach, writes specs. When same as orchestrator, planning is done in-process. |
| **builder** | `kimi-k2.6`, `minimax-m2.7` | Code implementation. For complex tasks the orchestrator may pick a heavier model from the pool. |
| **reviewer** | `kimi-k2.6`, `minimax-m2.7` | Code review. Orchestrator picks the strongest by tier for initial review. |
| **explorer** | `nemotron-3-ultra-fp4` | Codebase exploration — navigating files, reading code, tracing architecture. |
| **researcher** | `kimi-k2.6` | Research beyond the codebase — web search, documentation lookup, external sources. |

Defaults are hardcoded in `DEFAULT_MODEL_ROLES`. Roles accept any `provider/model-id` string or an array of strings. Only non-default values need to be specified; missing keys fall back to defaults.

#### How delegation works

The orchestrator receives explicit per-phase directives generated from the role configuration. For each pipeline phase (plan, build, review, explore, research), the system prompt tells the orchestrator exactly what to do:

- **Roles it owns** (its model ID appears in the role pool): "DO perform this work yourself."
- **Roles it does not own**: "DO NOT perform this work yourself. Delegate to Agent(type: X, model: Y)." — with the concrete model IDs from the pool.
- **Review is always delegated**, even when the orchestrator has the reviewer role, to ensure independence via a fresh context.

When a role pool has multiple models, the orchestrator picks the lightest-tier model that fits the task and escalates to heavy-tier only for complex work (concurrency, algorithms) or as a retry after a standard-tier model has failed.

Built-in models (kimchi-dev) have tier and description baked in. External models need metadata — see below.

#### Model metadata

External models (Anthropic, OpenAI, or any non-builtin provider) have no built-in tier or description. Without metadata, they default to `standard` tier, `vision: false`, and an auto-generated description based on their assigned roles. To give the orchestrator better routing information, add a `modelMetadata` section to `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "modelRoles": {
    "builder": ["kimchi-dev/minimax-m2.7", "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"],
    "reviewer": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"
  },
  "modelMetadata": {
    "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5": {
      "tier": "heavy",
      "description": "Strong general-purpose model — use for complex builds and thorough reviews."
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `tier` | `standard` | `light`, `standard`, or `heavy`. Used for complexity-based routing. |
| `description` | Auto-generated | Shown to the orchestrator so it can match model strengths to task requirements. |
| `vision` | `false` | Whether the model supports image input. |

With the metadata above, the orchestrator will use minimax for simple build chunks and Claude for complex ones. Without it, both models look like standard-tier to the orchestrator and selection is arbitrary.

Metadata can also be managed interactively via `/multi-model` → "Edit model metadata" — this is the only in-app path for configuring or overriding metadata, so model selection stays uninterrupted. Custom overrides can be reset to defaults from the same menu. Metadata for builtin models can be overridden the same way.

### Phase tracking

Kimchi tags every LLM request with a `phase:{name}` label for usage analytics and cost attribution. The orchestrator sets the phase as work progresses and it is displayed in the status line.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `explore` | Navigating the codebase, reading files to understand structure |
| `plan` | Designing, breaking down tasks, writing specs |
| `build` | Writing, modifying, or refactoring code |
| `review` | Analyzing output, verifying correctness |
| `research` | Investigating documentation, researching issues |

Subagents inherit the current phase from the orchestrator but cannot change it.

## Tags

Kimchi supports tagging LLM requests for usage tracking and cost attribution. Tags are included with every request and displayed in the status line, grouped by key with color coding.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/tags` | List all active tags |
| `/tags add key:value ...` | Add one or more tags (e.g., `/tags add project:myapp team:backend`) |
| `/tags remove tag ...` | Remove one or more user-defined tags |
| `/tags clear` | Remove all user-defined tags |

### Tag format

Tags use `key:value` format. Key and value must start and end with alphanumeric characters (middle characters may include `-`, `_`, `.`), each 64 characters max, 10 tags total.

### Tag defaults hierarchy

Default tags are resolved from three sources, strongest first:

1. `KIMCHI_TAGS` environment variable (comma-separated)
2. Project config — the nearest `.kimchi/tags.json` found walking up from the working directory (so monorepo subdirectories pick up the repo-level file)
3. Global config — `~/.config/kimchi/tags.json`

```bash
export KIMCHI_TAGS="team:backend,project:api"
```

Sources are unioned; when two sources define the same tag key, the stronger source's value wins. Default tags are shown with an `[env]`, `[project]`, or `[global]` marker in the `/tags` list; user-added tags show as `[user]`.

### Auto-tags

Two tags are added automatically to every request and do not count toward the 10 tag limit:

- `model:{model_id}` -- the model handling the request
- `phase:{phase}` -- the current work phase

### Persistence

User-defined tags (added via `/tags add`) are persisted with the session: once a session has its own tag set (created by any `/tags add`, `/tags remove`, or `/tags clear`), it fully overrides the defaults above and is restored when the session resumes. `KIMCHI_TAGS` must be set per session; it is the strongest source while present.

## Ferment V2

Ferment V2 is an experimental, branch-scoped objective controller. It keeps one objective active across turns, uses the normal Todo tools for tactical work, and does not create Ferment phases, workers, or worktrees. See the [Ferment V2 runtime guide](docs/ferment-v2.md) for the lifecycle and persistence contract.

Enable **Ferment V2** under `/resources` → **Experimental**, then restart Kimchi. It is disabled by default.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ferment-v2 <objective>` | Create an objective, or confirm replacement of an unfinished Ferment V2 run |
| `/ferment-v2 --tokens <n\|k\|m> <objective>` | Create an objective with a token budget, such as `--tokens 50k` |
| `/ferment-v2` | Show the current objective, status, revision, and latest completion evaluation |
| `/ferment-v2 edit [objective]` | Edit in place and redirect work to the new revision |
| `/ferment-v2 pause` | Stop automatic continuation without aborting a running tool |
| `/ferment-v2 resume` | Reactivate the current run |
| `/ferment-v2 clear` | Clear the run from the current session branch |

Ferment V2 state is stored in the native session journal, so restart, resume, rewind, and fork follow the selected branch. An old turn cannot update an edited or replaced run because model updates must match both its ID and revision.

At `turn_end`, Ferment V2 checkpoints the current session's assistant usage and active time. Reaching a token budget stops continuation before evaluation and changes the run to `budget_limited`. At the later settled checkpoint, an independent tool-free evaluator returns `met`, `impossible`, or `continue` only while the pending-input, tool-availability, identity, and stop-condition gates permit. The `fermenting time` counter counts active agent turns; cancellation, repeated errors, unchanged continuation, or evaluator unavailability pause the run. Runtime accounting is for the current session; the Terminal-Bench adapter separately aggregates valid usage from all discovered session files, including nested or child files.

Ferment V2 directs the agent to track tactical progress in the normal Todos widget without creating a second feature-specific checklist. `update_ferment_v2 complete` records an optional runtime completion claim and ends the working turn; it never completes the run by itself. The claim response stays hidden while evaluation runs. In interactive mode, a `met` verdict still requires a visible, fully completed Todo list for the current revision; headless mode has no visible widget and may proceed directly from evidenced `met`. Both start one buffered final-answer turn. `update_ferment_v2 blocked` remains immediate. Regular work tools remain available while the list is created or reconciled.

Evaluation details stay out of the visible transcript. `/ferment-v2` shows the evaluation count and latest verdict/reason; the evaluator uses the session model, or the configured `judge` role when multi-model is enabled, and records each check in a child session. Todo observations are valid only for the current session, Ferment V2 ID, and revision. User objective and Todo mutations wait for active work to settle before changing that state.

### Settings

Ferment V2's policy numbers are adjustable. Edit `~/.config/kimchi/harness/settings.json` directly, under a single `fermentV2` key:

```json
{
  "fermentV2": {
    "autoResume": true,
    "maxUnchangedContinuations": 3,
    "maxConsecutiveErrors": 3,
    "defaultTokenBudget": 200000,
    "evaluationTimeoutMs": 180000
  }
}
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `autoResume` | `true` | Whether to automatically queue a continuation turn for a resumed active Ferment V2 run on session start. |
| `maxUnchangedContinuations` | `3` | Consecutive continuation turns without recorded progress before the Ferment V2 run pauses itself. |
| `maxConsecutiveErrors` | `3` | Consecutive agent-error turns before the Ferment V2 run pauses itself. |
| `defaultTokenBudget` | unset | Token budget applied to `/ferment-v2 <objective>` when `--tokens` isn't given. An explicit `--tokens` always overrides this. |
| `evaluationTimeoutMs` | `180000` | How long the independent completion check is allowed to run before it's treated as unavailable. |

Only non-default values need to be specified; missing or invalid keys fall back to their default rather than failing the extension. There is no separate evaluator-model setting -- it uses the `judge` model role from [Model roles](#model-roles). The full evaluator evidence and failure-handling rules are in the [runtime guide](docs/ferment-v2.md).

## Ferment -- cross-session project management

Ferment is Kimchi's progressive-refinement project mode for multi-session work. Instead of starting from scratch each chat, Ferment persists a structured plan (goal, phases, steps) as a JSON state file.

### Quick start

```bash
kimchi --ferment "Build Tetris"
```

Or inside an active session:

```
/ferment new "Build Tetris"    # create a ferment
/ferment auto                   # keep going until done or blocked
```

### Concepts

- **Ferment** -- the top-level project (e.g. "Build Tetris", "Auth rewrite")
- **Phase** -- a milestone within the project (e.g. "Canvas & Grid", "Movement")
- **Step** -- a single executable task within a phase (e.g. "Create index.html")
- **Decision** -- an architectural choice recorded for posterity
- **Memory** -- a gotcha, convention, or pattern encountered during work

### State machine

All lifecycle transitions are validated by a deterministic finite state machine that enforces valid state changes and prevents illegal operations (e.g. completing a step before it starts, skipping an already-completed phase).

```
draft -> planned -> running -> [paused] -> complete
```

1. **draft** -- created via `/ferment new`, agent collects goal and phases conversationally
2. **planned** -- `scope_ferment` sets goal, criteria, constraints, phase breakdown
3. **running** -- `activate_ferment_phase` starts a phase, agent executes steps
4. **paused** -- user intervention required, or paused with `/ferment pause`
5. **complete** -- all phases terminal

### Continuation policy

Controls whether the active ferment advances across phase boundaries.

| Policy | Behavior | Command |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **manual** | Ask before moving to the next phase | `/ferment manual` |
| **automated** | Keep going until complete, blocked, paused, or user input is needed | `/ferment auto` |

Pause/resume is separate: `/ferment pause` stops the ferment, `/ferment resume` continues it using the current policy. `/ferment exit` leaves Ferment mode without deleting or abandoning the ferment; planned/running work is paused first, active Ferment UI/tools are cleared, and you can later select it from `/ferment list` or `/ferment switch`.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ferment` | Start a new ferment via prompt |
| `/ferment new "Name"` | Create new ferment |
| `/ferment switch <id>` | Resume by ID prefix or name |
| `/ferment delete <id>` | Delete permanently |
| `/ferment export` | Export stats to JSON |
| `/ferment progress` | Open phase/step navigator overlay |
| `/ferment manual` | Set manual continuation policy |
| `/ferment auto` | Set automated continuation policy |
| `/ferment pause` | Pause the active ferment lifecycle |
| `/ferment resume` | Resume the active ferment lifecycle |
| `/ferment exit` | Leave Ferment mode without deleting the ferment |

### Recovery

Every session writes a `ferment_reference` entry in the session log. On next start, the harness reads this entry and resumes from the exact state.

```bash
# Day 1
$ kimchi --ferment "Build Tetris"
# ... agent works, crashes, terminal closes ...

# Day 2
$ kimchi --ferment "Build Tetris"
# -> Rehydrates state, continues Phase 2 exactly where it left off
```

### Where state lives

```
.kimchi/
  ferments/
    <uuid>.json          -- snapshot (machine-readable plan state)
    <uuid>.events.jsonl  -- append-only audit log of every transition
  sessions/
    <timestamp>.jsonl    -- chat history + tool calls
```

Every mutation is persisted as an append-only event with pre/post state hashes, enabling full auditability. Stats (phase/step counts, timing, model usage, grade distributions) are computed on demand from the snapshot and exported via `/ferment export`.

For full documentation see `docs/ferment.md` and `docs/ferment-storage-schema.md`.

## LSP Integration

kimchi ships with built-in Language Server Protocol (LSP) support, giving the agent type-aware code intelligence. The extension loads by default — no configuration required.

### Supported languages

| Language | Server | Install |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript / JavaScript | `typescript-language-server` | `npm i -g typescript-language-server typescript` |
| Go | `gopls` | `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest` |

Servers are auto-detected via `which` on `PATH`. If a server binary is not found, the corresponding tools are silently unavailable.

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `lsp_diagnostics` | Get type errors, warnings, and linter diagnostics for a file |
| `lsp_hover` | Get type information and documentation for a symbol at a position |
| `lsp_definition` | Navigate to the definition of a symbol (supports `typeDefinition` and `implementation` variants) |
| `lsp_references` | Find all references to a symbol across the codebase |
| `lsp_rename` | Atomically rename a symbol across all files |

The agent is prompted to prefer LSP tools over text-based alternatives (e.g., `lsp_definition` over `grep` for navigating to definitions). File changes made via `edit`, `write`, or `read` are automatically synced to the language server.

### Status bar

When LSP servers are active, the status bar shows the server name(s) and current diagnostic error count (e.g., `LSP: typescript-language-server (3 diags)`).

## Remote Sessions

Hand off an in-progress session to a cloud sandbox with `/teleport` — the agent keeps running when you close your laptop, switch machines, or hand off to a teammate. Resume from the CLI, the Kimchi console, or VS Code.

> **Requires Kimchi CLI v0.1.52+.** Check with `kimchi --version`, update with `kimchi update`. Not available on Windows.

```bash
/teleport
```
### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/teleport [name] [flags]` | Rsync working tree to a cloud sandbox and foreground it |
| `/remote-sessions` | Browse all workspaces and sessions; reattach with Enter |
| `/sync up\|down --workspace <name> --source <path> --target <path>` | Push or pull files without restarting the session |
| `/terminal [name-or-id]` | Open a raw SSH shell on the sandbox |


### `/teleport` flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--workspace <id\|name>` | Reuse an existing workspace instead of creating a new one |
| `--git-repo <url>` | Clone from a git URL instead of rsyncing local files |
| `--branch <branch>` | Branch to check out after cloning (requires `--git-repo`) |
| `--allow-dirty` | Proceed with uncommitted changes |
| `--force` | Override the 5 GB workspace size limit |
| `--no-git-token` | Skip git credentials prompt |
| `--skip-session` | Start remote agent fresh (don't upload current session history) |

### Workspace sizing (`kimchi_workspace.yaml`)

Declare CPU, memory, and disk requests for the sandboxes your project creates — workspaces minted by `/teleport` and headless cloud agents alike — in a `kimchi_workspace.yaml` at the **root of your project**:

```yaml
# kimchi_workspace.yaml — safe to commit; no secrets belong here
resources:
  cpu: "250m"
  memory: "1Gi"
  pvcSize: "20Gi"
```

Values are Kubernetes quantity strings (`500m`, `1Gi`, `20Gi`) — quote them: unquoted plain numbers (`cpu: 2`) are read as numbers by YAML and refused, naming the field. Omit a field to inherit the org default. Unknown fields under `resources:` are likewise refused rather than silently ignored. When you run kimchi from a subdirectory, the file is looked up walking toward the repository root.

Sizing applies **only when a workspace is created** — resources are immutable once provisioned. Editing the file later won't resize an existing workspace: delete it (`/remote-sessions`) and re-teleport to pick up new values. Invalid values stop the command before anything is sent, naming the offending field.

Once teleported, you're in the **PTY overlay** — a fullscreen tabbed terminal. Use `Ctrl+B c` / `n` / `p` to open and switch tabs. Press `Ctrl+D` to drop back to local kimchi; the sandbox and agent keep running.

For full documentation see [docs.kimchi.dev/docs/coding-remote-sessions](https://docs.kimchi.dev/docs/coding-remote-sessions).

## Configuration

### Authentication

The API key is resolved in this order:

1. `KIMCHI_API_KEY` environment variable (takes precedence)
2. `~/.config/kimchi/config.json` field `api_key`

Run `kimchi setup` for an interactive first-time configuration.

### Agent config

Kimchi stores its configuration (settings, sessions, models) under:

```
~/.config/kimchi/harness/
```

### Context files

You can provide custom instructions that are injected into the system prompt on every session. Kimchi discovers two kinds of context files:

**Global** — applied to every session, regardless of project:

```
~/.config/kimchi/harness/AGENTS.md
```

Place rules that apply everywhere (e.g., your name, code style preferences, or global tool defaults) in this file. It is loaded before any project-level files.

**Project-level** — applied when working in a specific directory tree. Kimchi walks from the working directory up to the filesystem root and collects one context file per directory:

```
AGENTS.md
CLAUDE.md
```

Per directory, `AGENTS.md` takes priority over `CLAUDE.md`. A `.local.md` variant (e.g. `AGENTS.local.md`) is appended to its primary file for user-specific, gitignored overrides.

When both global and project files exist, global instructions appear first in the prompt, followed by ancestor directories, and finally the working directory. This means project-level rules can refine or override global ones.

### Packages

Kimchi supports native Pi packages. `kimchi install npm:<package>` installs a package only for Kimchi, while `pi install npm:<package>` keeps the package owned by the original Pi harness. Kimchi can also load original Pi packages through the **Pi package lookup** resource, so both CLIs can use Pi packages without sharing Kimchi's install scope.

If the same package is installed in both places, the Kimchi install wins. Disable original Pi package lookup with:

```bash
kimchi resources disable extensions.pi-package-lookup
```

Update packages with:

```bash
kimchi update                       # update installed packages, then Kimchi itself
kimchi update --extensions          # update installed packages only
kimchi update context-mode          # update one package by source or display name
kimchi update self                  # update Kimchi itself only
kimchi update v1.2.3                # install a specific Kimchi release (downgrades work too)
kimchi update v1.2.3-rc.1           # install a release candidate
kimchi update --canary              # install the latest canary build from master
```

### HTTP proxy

Kimchi respects `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables for network requests.

### Hooks

Users can add custom Bash hooks to rewrite or block shell commands before they run. Global hooks live in `~/.config/kimchi/harness/hooks/bash/`; project hooks live in `.kimchi/hooks/bash/` and default to disabled until enabled from `/resources` or `kimchi resources enable ...`.

See `docs/hooks.md` for the hook protocol and examples.

### Migrating from another coding agent

On first run, kimchi looks for an existing **Claude Code**, **OpenCode**, or **Cursor** installation and offers to migrate its MCP servers. If anything is migratable you will see a one-shot prompt:

```
+  Claude Code + OpenCode + Cursor configuration found
|
|  MCP servers: filesystem, github, ripgrep
|  Claude Code skills: 4 in ~/.claude/skills
|  OpenCode skills: 2 in ~/.config/opencode/skills
|  Cursor skills: 3 in ~/.cursor/skills
|
*  Migrate MCP servers to Kimchi?
|  * Migrate now
|  * Skip this time
|  * Never ask again
```

Discovered MCP servers are merged into `~/.config/kimchi/harness/mcp.json`. Existing Kimchi entries always win on name collisions, so re-running the migration is safe.

The prompt is only shown when something is actually worth migrating. If neither agent is installed or both are empty, the wizard skips silently.

#### Sources scanned

| Agent | Config files (read in order, results merged) | Skills directory |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude.json` (top-level `mcpServers` + per-project `projects[*].mcpServers`) | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| OpenCode | `$OPENCODE_CONFIG`, then `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, `opencode.jsonc`, `config.json`, `~/.opencode.json` | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, then `~/.config/cursor/mcp.json` | `.cursor/skills/`, then `~/.cursor/skills/` |

For OpenCode, both the modern (`mcp` block) and legacy Go-binary (`mcpServers` block) schemas are supported. Servers with `enabled: false` are skipped. For Cursor, servers with `disabled: true` are skipped.

#### Conflict resolution

When the same MCP server name appears in multiple sources:

1. **Within one agent**: earlier files win; project-level entries win over top-level (Claude Code); modern `mcp` block wins over legacy `mcpServers` (OpenCode); `~/.cursor/mcp.json` wins over `~/.config/cursor/mcp.json` (Cursor).
2. **Across agents**: Claude Code wins over OpenCode, which wins over Cursor.
3. **Against existing Kimchi config**: your entries in `~/.config/kimchi/harness/mcp.json` always win.

#### "Never ask again"

Stored in `~/.config/kimchi/config.json` (`migrationState: "skip-forever"`). Delete that field to re-trigger the prompt. Adding support for another agent is a small change -- drop a new definition into `src/agent-discovery/agents/` and append it to the registry.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 (LTS)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (dev server and binary compilation)
- [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) enabled (`corepack enable`)
- pnpm (installed automatically via corepack)

### Quick setup

```bash
./scripts/dev-startup.sh
```

This script checks and installs node, pnpm, and bun if missing, initializes git submodules, runs `pnpm install`, copies resources, and starts the harness with `pnpm run dev`.

### Manual setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:getkimchi/kimchi.git
cd kimchi
# Currently a no-op (no submodules after superpowers removal); kept for future use
git submodule update --init --recursive
corepack enable
pnpm install
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm run build` | Compile TypeScript to `dist/` and copy theme assets |
| `pnpm run dev` | Run the CLI locally via Bun |
| `pnpm run check` | Biome lint + TypeScript type check |
| `pnpm run lint` | Biome lint only |
| `pnpm run lint:fix` | Biome lint with auto-fix |
| `pnpm run test` | Run tests with vitest |
| `pnpm run test:smoke` | End-to-end smoke tests |

### Running locally

Propagate resources before first run:

```bash
node ./scripts/copy-resources.js --dev
```

Run the CLI directly via Bun:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Or build a standalone binary:

```bash
pnpm run build:binary
./dist/bin/kimchi
```

## Benchmarking

The `benchmark/` directory contains tools for smoke-testing kimchi sessions and auditing their quality.

- **Manual benchmarks** (`benchmark/manual/`) -- run predefined tasks against different models and compare results. See `benchmark/manual/README.md`.
- **Terminal-bench-2** (`benchmark/terminal-bench-2/`) -- run the [terminal-bench](https://www.harborframework.com/) suite (89 tasks) against kimchi inside Docker containers. See `benchmark/terminal-bench-2/README.md`.
- **Session audit** (`benchmark/audit-session/`) -- audit a completed session for phase discipline, code quality, architecture, testing, model alignment, and cost efficiency. See `benchmark/audit-session/README.md`.

## Release

Standalone binaries are built automatically by GitHub Actions when a version tag is pushed (`v*`). Binaries are compiled with `bun build --compile` and require no runtime on the user's machine.

Supported platforms:

- macOS (amd64, arm64)
- Linux (amd64, arm64)
- Windows (amd64)

Release assets follow the naming convention `kimchi_{os}_{arch}.tar.gz` for macOS/Linux and `kimchi_windows_amd64.zip` for Windows, with a `checksums.txt` (SHA256) for verification.

Windows build and local VM testing notes live in [`docs/windows/README.md`](docs/windows/README.md).
