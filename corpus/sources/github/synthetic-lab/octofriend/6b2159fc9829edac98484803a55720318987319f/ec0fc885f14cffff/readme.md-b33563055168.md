## About

Octo is a small, helpful, cephalopod-flavored coding assistant that works with
any OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible LLM API, and allows you to switch
models at will mid-conversation when a particular model gets stuck. Octo can
optionally use (and we recommend using) ML models we custom-trained and
open-sourced ([1](https://huggingface.co/syntheticlab/diff-apply),
[2](https://huggingface.co/syntheticlab/fix-json)) to automatically handle tool
call and code edit failures from the main coding models you're working with:
the autofix models work with any coding LLM. Octo works great with Kimi
K2.7-Code, GLM-5.2, GPT-5.6, and Claude 5 (although pretty much any agentic
coding model will work). Octo wants to help you because Octo is your friend.

Octo has zero telemetry. Using Octo with a privacy-focused LLM provider (may we
selfishly recommend [Synthetic](https://synthetic.new)?) means your code stays
yours. But you can also use it with any OpenAI-compatible API provider, with
Anthropic, or with local LLMs you run on your own machine.

## Enabling web search

By default, Octo will look for Synthetic API keys to use Synthetic's private,
zero-data-retention search API to power Octo's web search tool. If you have any
Synthetic models configured anywhere in Octo, Octo's search tool will Just
Work: even non-Synthetic-hosted models, like Claude, will be able to use Octo's
web search tool.

If you don't want to use Synthetic's search API, but you still want to use the
web search tool, you can configure the `search` config in
`~/.config/octofriend/octofriend.json5`:

```typescript
{
  // ...the rest of your config,
  search: {
    url: "some_search_api_url",
    apiEnvVar: "SOME_ENV_VAR_FOR_AUTH"
  },
}
```

The search tool will make POST requests against the configured URL with the
following format, which is compatible with both Synthetic and
[Exa](https://exa.ai):

```javascript
{
  query: "some search query",
}
```

If you don't configure the `search` config, and you don't configure any
Synthetic API keys, Octo's harness will automatically hide the web search tool
so Octo doesn't try to call it.

## Resuming and switching sessions

Octo automatically saves your conversations per-directory. When you exit a
session with conversation history, Octo prints out the command you'll need to
pick up right where you left off:

```bash
octo --resume <session-id>
```

To see all of your saved sessions for the current directory along with their
session IDs, run:

```bash
octo session list
```

You can also switch sessions without leaving the app: press `Ctrl+p` to open
the menu and select "Load previous session". You'll see a list of previous
sessions for the current directory: pick one to switch over to it. Your
current session isn't lost: you can always switch back to it later, since it
was saved too.

If you started a session inside a Docker container with `octo docker run`,
you can resume it the same way and optionally replace the original `docker
run` arguments:

```bash
octo --resume <session-id> [new docker run args...]
```

## Attaching images

If your currently-selected model has image input enabled, you can attach
pictures to your messages: just paste an image from your clipboard into the input box. Each attached image will show up as a badge alongside the input,
and will be sent along with your message when you hit Enter. You can attach
multiple images to a single message.

Press `Backspace` with your cursor after the image to delete it, or press `Ctrl+c` to clear all attached images.

If you want to enable image input for a custom model, add a `modalities`
entry for it in `~/.config/octofriend/octofriend.json5`:

```json5
{
  nickname: "My vision model",
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:SOME_PORT",
  apiEnvVar: "SOME_ENV_VAR_FOR_AUTH",
  model: "some-model-string",
  modalities: {
    image: {
      enabled: true,
      maxSizeMB: 10,
      acceptedMimeTypes: ["image/png", "image/jpeg", "image/webp", "image/gif"],
    },
  },
}
```

## Sandboxing Octo

Octo has built-in Docker support, and can attach to any Docker container
without needing special configuration or editing the image or container. To
make Octo run inside an _existing_ container you have running — for example, if
you already have a Docker Compose setup — run `octo docker connect
your-container-name`.

To have Octo launch a Docker image and shut it down when Octo quits, you can
run:

```bash
# Make sure to add the -- before the docker run args!
octo docker run -- ordinary-docker-run-args
```

For example, to launch Octo inside an Alpine Linux container:

```bash
octo docker run -- -d -i -t alpine /bin/sh
```

All of Octo shell commands and filesystem edits and reads will happen inside
the container. However, Octo will continue to use any MCP servers you have
defined in your config via your host machine (since the MCP servers are
presumably running on your machine, not inside the container), and will make
HTTP requests from your machine as well if it uses the built-in `fetch` tool,
so that you can use arbitrary containers that may not have `wget` or `curl`
installed.

## Rules

Octo will look for instruction files named like so:

- `OCTO.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `AGENTS.md`

Octo uses the _first_ one of those it finds: so if you want to have different
instructions for Octo than for Claude, just have an `OCTO.md` and a
`CLAUDE.md`, and Octo will ignore your `CLAUDE.md`.

Octo will search the current directory for rules, and every parent directory,
up until (inclusive of) your home directory. All rule files will be merged: so
if you want project-specific rules as well as general rules to apply
everywhere, you can add an `OCTO.md` to your project, as well as a global
`OCTO.md` in your home directory.

If you don't want to clutter your home directory, you can also add a global
rules file in `~/.config/octofriend/OCTO.md`.

## Skills

Octo supports the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) spec for giving
reusable context-dependent instructions. If you want to give special
instructions for Octo to do code reviews, for example, you might write a code
review skill file, and Octo will intelligently load the skill when it needs to
do code reviews. You can find the full skill spec on the [Agent Skills
website](https://agentskills.io), but they're essentially just tagged Markdown
with optional scripts. Here's a very simple code review skill you might use:

```markdown
---
name: "pr-review"
description: "Review Github pull requests"
---

To load a Github pull request, run the fetch tool twice:

## First fetch

First, load the URL for the PR to understand the author's intent.

Your fetch tool does not execute JavaScript. Note that parts of the Github UI
may fail without JS; for example, loading comments might say:

    UH OH!
    There was an error while loading"

This is okay and expected. Don't worry about that.

## Second fetch: load the diff

To load the diff for the PR, fetch the PR URL with a `.diff`
attached to the end. For example, to review
`https://github.com/synthetic-lab/octofriend/pull/66`, you should fetch:

`https://github.com/synthetic-lab/octofriend/pull/66.diff`

The diff is the most important part. The author may be incorrect, or have the
right idea but the wrong implementation. Focus on whether there are any bugs or
unexpected behavior.
```

We automatically detect skills in the following places:

- `~/.config/agents/skills`, for global skill definitions
- `.agents/skills`, for skills relative to the current directory Octo is
  working in. For example, if your company has special guidelines for agents,
  you can distribute them with your company's repo in an `.agents/skills`
  directory.

If there are more directories you want Octo to discover skills from, you can
add them to your `~/.config/octofriend/octofriend.json5` config file like so:

```javascript
skills: {
  paths: [
    // a list of directory paths containing skills
  ],
},
```

## Connecting Octo to MCP servers

Octo can do a lot out of the box — pretty much anything is possible with enough
Bash — but if you want access to rich data from an MCP server, it'll help Octo
out a lot to just provide the MCP server directly instead of trying to contort
its tentacles into crafting the right Bash-isms. After you run `octofriend` for
the first time, you'll end up with a config file in
`~/.config/octofriend/octofriend.json5`. To hook Octo up to your favorite MCP
server, add the following to the config file:

```json5
mcpServers: {
  serverName: {
    command: "command-string",
    args: [
      "arguments",
      "to",
      "pass",
    ],
  },
},
```

For example, to plug Octo into your Linear workspace:

```json5
mcpServers: {
  linear: {
    command: "npx",
    args: [ "-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.linear.app/sse" ],
  },
},
```

## Language servers (LSP tools)

Octo can use language servers to give your coding model IDE-grade navigation
tools: jumping to definitions, finding references, listing symbols in a file,
hovering for type info, and more. If an LSP server for a file's extension is
installed on your machine, Octo will automatically detect it and expose the
corresponding tools to the model: there's no configuration required.

Octo knows how to detect a bunch of popular language servers out of the box,
including `typescript-language-server`, `gopls`, `rust-analyzer`,
`bash-language-server`, `lua-language-server`, `ruby-lsp`, `jdtls`, `hls`,
`clojure-lsp`, `yaml-language-server`, and several others: just install the
one you want via your usual package manager and Octo will pick it up.

To add support for a language server Octo doesn't know about (or to override
the command Octo uses for one of the built-in servers), add an entry to the
`lsp` block in `~/.config/octofriend/octofriend.json5`:

```json5
lsp: {
  pyright: {
    // The command to start the language server (must speak stdio LSP)
    command: ["pyright-langserver", "--stdio"],
    // File extensions this server should handle
    extensions: [".py"],
    // Files used to find the project root, searching upwards from the file
    // being edited. Can be an empty list if the server doesn't need one.
    rootCandidates: ["pyproject.toml", "setup.py", ".git"],
  },
},
```

Custom servers take precedence over Octo's built-in ones when both claim the
same file extension.

You can also disable language servers entirely, or disable individual servers:

```json5
// Disable all LSP tools:
lsp: false,

// Or, disable a single server:
lsp: {
  "typescript-language-server": { disabled: true },
},
```

## Using Octo with local LLMs

If you're a relatively advanced user, you might want to use Octo with local
LLMs. Assuming you already have a local LLM API server set up like ollama or
llama.cpp, using Octo with it is super easy. When adding a model, make sure to
select `Add a custom model...`. Then it'll prompt you for your API base URL,
which is probably something like: `http://localhost:3000`, or whatever port
you're running your local LLM server on. After that it'll prompt you for an
environment variable to use as a credential; just use any non-empty environment
variable and it should work (since most local LLM server ignore credentials
anyway).

You can also edit the Octofriend config directly in
`~/.config/octofriend/octofriend.json5`. Just add the following to your list of
models:

```json5
{
  nickname: "The string to show in the UI for your model name",
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:SOME_PORT",
  apiEnvVar: "any non-empty env var",
  model: "The model string used by the API server, e.g. openai/gpt-oss-20b",
}
```

## Debugging

By default, Octo tries to present a pretty clean UI. If you want to see
underlying error messages from APIs or tool calls, run Octo with the
`OCTO_VERBOSE` environment variable set to any truthy string; for example:

```bash
OCTO_VERBOSE=1 octofriend
```

## Desktop notifications

There's a hidden "Notifications" menu that only appears if you've configured
desktop notifications. To configure desktop notifications, add a block like
this to your `octofriend.json5`:

```json5
notifications: {
  notifyCommand: "notify-send Octo 'Finished responding!'",
},
```

Or for macOS:

```json5
notifications: {
  notifyCommand: 'osascript -e \'display notification "Octo finished!"\'',
},
```

This enables the Notifications submenu in the main `ctrl-p` menu. You can set
it to the following three settings:

- Notify the next time Octo needs input
- Notify any time Octo needs input this session
- Always notify any time Octo needs input

The last option will be persisted to your config file, if you set it.

By default, for the session-level and persistent notifications, Octo will wait
10 seconds before notifying you, and if it receives input during that time
it'll skip the notification (so as to not spam you with notifications when
you're actively attending to it and chatting). To change the wait time, set:

```json5
notifications: {
  notifyCommand: "some command",
  notifyTimeoutMs: 20000, // Or however many milliseconds you want to wait
},
```

## Opting into canary versions

If you want to use unreleased versions of Octo, clone this repo and read the
instructions in `canary.sh` to install `canary-octo` in your shell.
