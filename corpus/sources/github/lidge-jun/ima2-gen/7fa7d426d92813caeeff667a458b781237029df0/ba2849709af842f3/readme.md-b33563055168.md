`ima2-gen` is a local-first visual generation runtime and studio for people and coding agents, with reproducible image and video workflows across multiple providers.

Install globally and generate images and videos through the core registry: OpenAI OAuth/API, Grok OAuth/API, Antigravity CLI, Gemini API, AtlasCloud, MiniMax, NovelAI, and registered ComfyUI workflows. Runway and Higgsfield remain separate MCP-backed integrations. Iterate with history, references, node branches, multimode batches, and Canvas Mode cleanup — now with one-click GPT background transparency (server-verified real alpha), annotation hover feedback, and a full light/dark/system theme.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g ima2-gen
ima2 setup
ima2 serve
```

Then open `http://localhost:3333`.

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t ima2-gen .
docker run -d -p 3333:3333 -e IMA2_LAN_TOKEN=change-me -v ima2-data:/data ima2-gen
```

See [docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md) for compose usage, required environment, and limitations.

To generate from the CLI, inspect the live lane catalog and choose explicit image/video defaults once:

```bash
ima2 models
ima2 defaults set image oauth/gpt-5.6-luna
ima2 defaults set video grok/grok-imagine-video-1.5
ima2 gen "a clean product photo of a red guitar pedal"
ima2 video "a cat playing piano" --duration 5 --resolution 720p
ima2 video "animate this scene" --ref photo.png --duration 10
```

`ima2 gen` and generate-mode `ima2 video` fail closed with `NO_DEFAULT_MODEL` until a CLI target is configured, unless that call passes `--model <lane>/<model>` or an explicit `--provider <lane>`. This prevents an upgrade from silently switching providers or billing lanes.

If `3333` is already occupied, `ima2-gen` binds the next available port and writes the actual URL to `~/.ima2/server.json`. Use `ima2 open` or the URL printed in the terminal instead of assuming the port.

> **Using npx?** See [docs/NPX_QUICKSTART.md](docs/NPX_QUICKSTART.md) for the `npx ima2-gen serve` workflow.

### One-Click Install (no npm required)

Don't have Node.js or npm? Use the platform install script — it detects your environment, installs Node LTS if needed, then installs ima2-gen.

**macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://lidge-jun.github.io/ima2-gen/install-mac.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://lidge-jun.github.io/ima2-gen/install-windows.ps1 | iex
```

**Linux / WSL:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://lidge-jun.github.io/ima2-gen/install-linux.sh | bash
```

Each script checks the package-derived Node.js floor, installs Node LTS through the best available method, installs once, and runs the offline installation check before launching `ima2 serve`. It does not stop unrelated processes or clear global locks.

### Setup

`ima2 setup` offers four authentication choices:

1. **GPT OAuth** — login with ChatGPT account (free, images only)
2. **Grok OAuth** — login with xAI/Grok account (images + video)
3. **Both** — GPT OAuth + Grok OAuth (full feature access)
4. **Web setup** — configure everything in the web UI

Video generation requires Grok OAuth (option 2 or 3). Run `ima2 grok login` separately if you already have GPT OAuth configured and want to add video support; it defaults to the manual-paste flow.

### Updating

Stop the running server with Ctrl+C, then:
(or from another terminal: `ima2 stop`)

```bash
npm install -g ima2-gen@latest
```

Ctrl+C now performs a clean shutdown — closing the database, stopping child processes, and releasing file locks. If an installation fails, inspect the reported npm permissions or stop the specific `ima2` process yourself; the installer does not perform broad process cleanup.

## What It Does

- **Classic mode**: generate, edit, reuse the current image, paste references, and continue from history.
- **Node mode**: branch a good image into multiple directions without losing the original.
- **Multimode batches**: launch several Classic outputs from one prompt, watch slot-by-slot progress, and continue from the best result.
- **Video generation**: create short videos from text, a single image, or multiple reference images via Grok video models. SSE streaming shows planning → submitted → progress % → done. Video frame copy buttons (First/Mid/Last) let you extract and copy keyframes from generated videos.
- **Storyboard mode**: toggle storyboard mode in the composer to maintain character and scene continuity across sequential frames. Works with both image and video generation — image keyframes are composed for video production, and video clips inherit character/environment lock rules.
- **Canvas Mode**: zoom, pan, annotate (with hover highlighting), erase, clean backgrounds, keep transparent previews, and export either alpha or matte-backed versions. A one-click **GPT transparency** button sends the current image through the i2i edit lane and reports honestly whether the result carries real pixel alpha — verified on the server, never trusted from provider metadata.
- **Raster-to-vector SVG**: trace flat raster art into real SVG paths with `ima2 vectorize`, from AssetGen/Assets, or from Canvas Export. Canvas labels its older self-contained wrapper as **SVG (embedded raster)** so it cannot be mistaken for a trace.
- **NovelAI dual prompt**: when NovelAI is selected, Classic, Home, and the mobile compose sheet show **Positive prompt** and **Undesired content** as peer panes; they stack below a 719px composer container. Other providers keep the normal single prompt.
- **Prompt Builder backend choice**: Settings > Providers can keep Builder routing on **Auto** or pin a supported text backend and model, and the **via &lt;backend&gt;** badge shows which backend actually answered.
- **Light & dark themes**: a token-based light mode with tinted neutrals and AA contrast, switchable between light / dark / system in Settings, with no flash on load.
- **Local gallery**: keep generated assets on your machine with session-aware history. By default the gallery shows the current session and an All Images toggle reveals the full history; the default scope is sticky across sessions. Each image records its generation time and reasoning effort in the result metadata, so they persist across reloads.
- **Reference images**: drag, drop, paste, and attach up to 5 references (images) or up to 7 references (video); large images are compressed before upload.
- **Prompt library imports**: import local prompt packs, GitHub folders, and curated GPT-image prompt hints into the built-in prompt library.
- **Mobile shell**: use the app bar, compose sheet, and compact settings toggle on smaller screens.
- **Observable jobs**: active and recent jobs are tracked with safe logs and request IDs.

### Agent Skills

ima2-gen ships three packaged skills for AI coding agents. These are Markdown
instruction files that agents load to get structured workflows for image/video
generation, frontend asset production, and design direction discovery.

| Skill | Command | What It Covers |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Core** | `ima2 skill` | CLI reference, prompting protocol, provider routing, Korean text, video workflows |
| **Frontend** | `ima2 skill front` | Asset pipeline (parallel gen, variant selection, provider routing), motion/video for web, responsive, a11y, anti-slop, 30+ reference files |
| **UI/UX Design** | `ima2 skill uiux` | Image-first design direction discovery, UX states, design-isms, product personalities, DESIGN.md workflow, 18 reference files |

```bash
ima2 skill ls            # list available skills
ima2 skill front         # print the frontend skill
ima2 skill uiux          # print the design skill
ima2 skill front path    # print file path (for agents)
ima2 skill front --json  # JSON wrapper (for agents)
ima2 skill front refs    # list reference modules (35 files)
ima2 skill front ref motion        # load one reference module
ima2 skill install --dir <path>     # install skills to agent's skill dir
ima2 skill install --tmp            # install to temp dir (fallback)
```

The Frontend and UI/UX skills are production-grade design engineering guides
adapted for the ima2 workflow. They cover typography, color systems, layout
discipline, Korean UX patterns, motion choreography, and visual verification,
with every asset generation step mapped to `ima2 gen`, `ima2 video`, and
`ima2 multimode` commands.

### SSE Multiplexing

The web UI uses a single `GET /api/events` Server-Sent Events connection for all generation progress. Multimode, node, and video requests are submitted as async POST (`202 { requestId }`) and progress events are multiplexed through a shared event bus. This eliminates the browser 6-connection limit that previously caused gallery hangs during concurrent generation. CLI clients that do not send `async: true` still receive per-request SSE streams for backward compatibility.

## Provider Paths

Image generation can run through the local Codex/ChatGPT OAuth path, a configured OpenAI API key, the Grok provider, or the Gemini provider via Antigravity CLI.

- `provider: "oauth"` uses the local Codex OAuth proxy.
- `provider: "api"` calls the OpenAI Responses API with the hosted `image_generation` tool.
- `provider: "grok"` calls `https://api.x.ai` directly with the xAI OAuth session stored in `~/.progrok/auth.json`, running mandatory xAI Web Search plus a planner pass (default: `grok-4.5`, configurable in settings or via `--planner-model`) before the xAI Images API call. `grok-4.3` remains available as an explicit compatibility override. Log in once with `ima2 grok login` or the Settings **Switch Account** button; the session refreshes itself two minutes before expiry.
- `provider: "grok-api"` calls the xAI Images API directly with `XAI_API_KEY` (no OAuth session involved).
- `provider: "nai"` calls the NovelAI image API with a persistent API token (saved in Settings > API Keys or `NOVELAI_API_KEY`; no fixed token prefix is required). Four models: `nai-diffusion-5-full`, `nai-diffusion-5-curated`, `nai-diffusion-4-5-full`, `nai-diffusion-4-5-curated`. Responses arrive as a ZIP archive that ima2 decodes to PNG. Text-to-image only — reference images, edits, and masks are refused rather than silently dropped. Browser and CLI surfaces expose negative prompt, sampler/schedule, steps/guidance/CFG rescale, seed, presets, Auto SMEA, Decrisper, Variety+, and V5 alpha.
- `provider: "agy"` spawns the Antigravity CLI (`agy -p`) to generate images via Google Gemini's `default_api:generate_image` tool (model: `nano-banana-2`). Output is fixed at 1024×1024 JPEG, max 3 reference images. No web search, quality, or size controls.
- `provider: "gemini-api"` calls the Google Generative Language API directly. Supports two models: `nano-banana-2` (Gemini 3.1 Flash Image) and `nano-banana-pro` (Gemini 3 Pro Image). Auth is via `GEMINI_API_KEY` env var, web UI key management, or a Vertex AI service account JSON (`VERTEX_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`). When both an API key and Vertex credentials are configured, Vertex takes priority. Supports variable aspect ratios (1:1 through 21:9) and four resolution tiers (512px, 1K, 2K, 4K); these controls are only honored on the direct API path — the Vertex AI endpoint ignores aspect/size because it does not accept the `response_format` field. Per-model cost differs: `nano-banana-2` (Flash): 512=$0.001, 1K=$0.003, 2K=$0.004, 4K=$0.006; `nano-banana-pro`: 1K=$0.007, 2K=$0.007, 4K=$0.013. No web search or mask controls.
- API-key generation supports classic generate, edit, mask-guided edit, multimode, and node generation.
- Grok generation supports Classic, Node, and Agent flows. If a Classic reference, Node parent image, or Agent current image is present, ima2 switches the final Grok call to xAI image edit so image-to-image context is preserved.

If no provider is specified, the app keeps the current GPT OAuth/default behavior. GPT OAuth and API-key generation default to `gpt-5.6-luna`; the API-key path also defaults to `low` reasoning and `1024x1024` unless the request passes validated options. Grok image generation defaults to `grok-imagine-image-quality`.

One caveat on the OAuth Grok lane: xAI documents only `/v1/me` as accepting an OAuth token, so image and video calls to `api.x.ai` with that token ride an undocumented path. It works today — progrok relied on the same path — but it carries no compatibility promise. If xAI closes it, `provider: "grok-api"` with `XAI_API_KEY` is the documented route and stays unaffected.

Grok image generation exposes a model picker (`grok-imagine-image` / `grok-imagine-image-quality`) and a size picker (aspect ratio + 1k/2k resolution). The Settings page prefers the Grok Build weekly credits percentage and reset time from `GET /v1/billing?format=credits`; if that source is unavailable, it falls back to the legacy monthly billing window and `$used/$limit`. A **Switch Account** button starts a device-code OAuth flow (`POST /api/auth/switch`) for re-authenticating without leaving the app.

Grok video generation defaults to canonical `grok-imagine-video-1.5`; `grok-imagine-video` remains available for base-model-only Ref2V, V2V edit, and extension paths, and the legacy `grok-imagine-video-1.5-preview` string is accepted as an alias. Three modes are auto-detected from reference count: text-to-video (0 refs), image-to-video (1 ref), and reference-to-video (2-14 refs; up to 15s on grok-imagine-video-1.5, 10s on grok-imagine-video). 1080p is available for `grok-imagine-video-1.5` prompt-only text-to-video and single image/frame image-to-video; prompt-only 1.5 uses the internal white-canvas I2V shim before the upstream request. Video controls include duration (1-15s), resolution (480p, 720p, 1080p when supported), and aspect ratio (1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 4:3, 3:4, 3:2, 2:3, auto).

## Model Guidance

Image generation defaults to **`gpt-5.6-luna`** on the GPT lane. Prompt Builder backend selection is separate: **Auto** chooses the first ready supported text backend, while Settings can pin one explicitly. The `via <backend>` badge reports the backend that actually answered.

- `gpt-5.6-luna` — current default image model on the GPT lane and the default GPT Builder model when that backend is selected.
- `gpt-5.6-terra` / `gpt-5.6-sol` — current GPT-5.6 alternatives when your account exposes them.
- `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini` — supported compatibility choices.

The app also exposes quality (`low`, `medium`, `high`) and moderation (`auto`, `low`) controls.

## Workflows

### Classic Mode

Use Classic when you want one strong result quickly.

1. Write a prompt.
   With NovelAI, use **Positive prompt** for desired content and **Undesired content** for what the image should avoid.
2. Attach or paste references if needed.
3. Pick model, quality, size, format, and moderation.
4. Generate one image, or enable multimode to fan out several candidate slots from the same prompt.
5. Copy, download, continue from the result, or send it into Canvas Mode.

For a control-by-control guide to Prompt Studio, multimode recipes, Direct mode,
reasoning effort, and gallery favorite behavior, see the
[Prompt Studio manual](docs/PROMPT_STUDIO.md).

![Multimode sequence with four candidate slots generating from one prompt and active job history in the sidebar.](assets/screenshots/multimode-sequence.png)

### Node Mode

Use Node mode when you want to explore branches.

![Node mode with connected generated cards and compact per-node metadata.](assets/screenshots/node-graph-branching.png)

Each node keeps its own prompt and result. Root nodes can attach local references; child nodes use the parent image as their source. Completed jobs are matched back to nodes by request ID, so reloads and graph version conflicts can recover finished results.

### Canvas Mode

Use Canvas Mode when a generated image is close but needs targeted cleanup before the next prompt.

- Separate viewport panning from selection so you can move around a zoomed image without accidentally changing annotations.
- Use annotation, eraser, multiselect, grouping, undo/redo, and sticky notes while keeping the original gallery image available.
- Pick background-cleanup seeds, preview the mask, and save the cleanup as a canvas version.
- Detect transparent images and show a checkerboard preview; export with preserved alpha or with a chosen matte color.
- Choose **SVG (embedded raster)** for a self-contained canvas document, or **Trace to SVG (vector)** to flatten the composition and open the shared real-vector tracing panel.
- Saved canvas versions stay hidden from Gallery and HistoryStrip, but Canvas Mode can reuse them and attach a canvas version as the next reference.
- Hover any annotation with the select tool to see a live outline and a move cursor before you click.
- Press the **GPT transparency** button in the canvas toolbar to remove the background through the OAuth i2i lane in one click. The server decodes the returned bytes and reports `alphaVerified` — the toast tells you whether real transparency actually landed, instead of assuming.

![Canvas Mode in light theme with the one-click GPT transparency flow and a transparent checkerboard result.](assets/screenshots/canvas-mode-light-transparency.png)

### Prompt Library And Imports

The prompt library can now be filled from local files, GitHub folders, curated sources, and GPT-image hint packs. Imported prompts are indexed locally so search and ranking work without re-importing the same source every session.

![Prompt import dialog for bringing prompts into the library, showing GitHub folder controls, curated sources, and searched prompt candidates before import.](assets/screenshots/prompt-import-dialog.png)

### Experimental Card News Mode

Card News is still dev-only and experimental. It is hidden in the default
published runtime unless explicitly enabled for development, and it should not
be treated as a stable public feature yet.

### Settings

The settings workspace keeps account, model, appearance, and language controls away from the generation sidebar.
Prompt Builder backend lives under Providers: Auto tries GPT OAuth, Grok, OpenAI API, then Grok API and uses the first ready lane. An explicit choice stays pinned and returns a typed error when unavailable; the Builder surface displays the backend that actually answered.
Appearance now includes a light / dark / system theme toggle; the light palette uses tinted neutrals with AA contrast and applies before first paint.

## CLI Commands

### Server

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `ima2 serve [--dev]` | Start the local web server; `--dev` enables verbose server diagnostics |
| `ima2 stop [--force]` | Stop the running server safely — graceful admin-API stop first, then SIGTERM/SIGKILL; verifies the advertised pid against `/api/health` so a recycled pid is never killed |
| `ima2 service <sub>` | Background service: `install`/`uninstall`/`start`/`stop`/`restart`/`status`/`logs`/`repair` — launchd on macOS, systemd user unit on Linux, auto-start on login with crash restart |
| `ima2 setup` | Reconfigure saved auth |
| `ima2 status` | Show config and OAuth status |
| `ima2 doctor` | Diagnose Node, package, config, and auth |
| `ima2 doctor image-probe [--json]` | Run sanitized image probes for no-image diagnostics |
| `ima2 open` | Open the web UI |
| `ima2 reset` | Remove saved config |

### Client

These require a running `ima2 serve`. The CLI covers every server route. The most common ones are below — the [full CLI reference](docs/CLI.md) lists everything (generation, history, sessions, prompt library, annotations, Card News, observability, config).

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `ima2 models [--kind image\|video] [--lane <lane>] [--json]` | List live lanes, status, model IDs, and capabilities |
| `ima2 defaults set image\|video <lane>/<model>` | Persist the fail-closed CLI target for image or video generation |
| `ima2 defaults reset image\|video` | Remove a persisted CLI generation target |
| `ima2 gen <prompt> [--model <lane>/<model>]` | Generate from the CLI; requires an explicit target or saved image default |
| `ima2 edit <file> --prompt <text>` | Edit an existing image |
| `ima2 vectorize <input.png> [-o output.svg]` | Trace PNG/JPEG/WebP into a real SVG locally; no server or provider required |
| `ima2 prompt build --message <text> [--backend <backend>] [--model <model>]` | Refine prompt intent through the configured or explicitly selected Prompt Builder backend; requires the local server |
| `ima2 multimode <prompt>` | Multi-image SSE generation |
| `ima2 video <prompt> [--model <lane>/<model>]` | Generate video through a Grok or MCP lane; requires an explicit target or saved video default |
| `ima2 ls [--session <id>] [--favorites]` | List recent history |
| `ima2 show <name> [--metadata]` | Reveal a generated asset |
| `ima2 prompt ls -q <search>` | Search the prompt library |
| `ima2 inflight ls [--terminal]` | List active and recent jobs (alias of `ps`) |
| `ima2 config set <key> <value>` | Write to `~/.ima2/config.json` |
| `ima2 ping` | Health-check the running server |

The server advertises its actual port at `~/.ima2/server.json`. If `3333` is busy, the backend falls back to `3334+` and CLI commands follow the advertised URL. Override discovery with `--server <url>` or `IMA2_SERVER=http://localhost:3333`.

```bash
ima2 models --kind image
ima2 gen "poster" --model oauth/gpt-5.6-luna --reasoning-effort high
ima2 gen "1girl, blue hair" --model nai/nai-diffusion-5-full --nai-negative-prompt "lowres, watermark"
ima2 vectorize logo.png -o logo.svg --json
ima2 prompt build --message "Make this prompt production-ready" --backend auto --model auto
ima2 edit input.png --prompt "make it rainy" --web-search
ima2 multimode "two cats playing" -n 2
ima2 video "a cat playing piano" --model grok/grok-imagine-video-1.5 --duration 5 --resolution 720p
ima2 video "animate this" --model grok/grok-imagine-video-1.5 --ref photo.png --aspect-ratio 16:9
ima2 inflight ls --terminal
ima2 config set imageModels.reasoningEffort high
```

`IMA2_GROK_PROXY_HOST`, `IMA2_GROK_PROXY_PORT`, `IMA2_NO_GROK_PROXY`, and `IMA2_GROK_RESTART_*` were removed in 3.16 together with the local Grok proxy; they are no longer read, and setting them is harmless.

### Logging modes

`ima2 serve` keeps terminal output intentionally quiet: startup URLs, warnings, and errors stay visible, while request/node/OAuth structured logs are hidden by default.

Use `ima2 serve --dev`, `npm run dev`, or `IMA2_LOG_LEVEL=debug ima2 serve` when you need request IDs, node generation phases, OAuth stream diagnostics, or inflight state transitions. Explicit `IMA2_LOG_LEVEL` and `~/.ima2/config.json` values still override the built-in defaults.

## API Reference

The endpoint list moved to [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) so this README can stay focused on first-run use.

## Troubleshooting

**`ima2 ping` says the server is unreachable**
Start `ima2 serve`, then check `~/.ima2/server.json`. You can also run `ima2 ping --server http://localhost:3333`.

**GPT OAuth login does not work**
Re-run `ima2 setup` (option 1), confirm `ima2 status`, then restart `ima2 serve`.

**`fetch failed` repeats on a proxy/VPN network**
Check that the local OAuth proxy is reachable. On networks that require a proxy, enable your proxy client's TUN/TURN-style mode, then retry `openai-oauth --port 10531`. If it still fails, set `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` in the same terminal that runs `ima2 serve` or `openai-oauth`. On Windows, also check for auto-start network interception tools, including DNS/fragmentation bypass tools such as SecretDNS, because they can break OAuth or streaming image responses even when the browser appears connected.

**Images fail with `API_KEY_REQUIRED`**
Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` or configure an API key before using `provider: "api"`. The default GPT OAuth path still works without an API key.

**Image generation returns `EMPTY_RESPONSE` or no image data**
Run `ima2 doctor image-probe --json > ima2-image-probe.json` and attach the safe JSON when opening an issue. For GPT OAuth cases, also capture `ima2 gen "고양이" --model oauth/gpt-5.6-luna --no-web-search --json` and `ima2 gen "고양이" --model oauth/gpt-5.6-luna --json` while `ima2 serve` is running. Do not share ChatGPT cookies, OAuth token files, API keys, raw upstream responses, prompt history, or generated base64. See the [FAQ support bundle](docs/FAQ.md#what-should-i-share-when-oauth-image-generation-returns-no-image).

**A large reference image fails**
The app compresses large JPEG/PNG references before upload. If a file still fails, convert it to JPEG or PNG at a lower resolution and try again. HEIC/HEIF files are not supported by the browser path.

**Old gallery images are missing after updating**
Recent versions moved generated images from the installed package folder to `~/.ima2/generated`. Run `ima2 doctor` and see [Recover old images](docs/RECOVER_OLD_IMAGES.md).

**`gpt-5.5` fails but other models work**
Update Codex CLI first, then retry. If it still fails, your account or backend route may not expose the same image capability or quota for `gpt-5.5` yet; use `gpt-5.4` as the stable fallback.

**The app opened on a different port**
If the requested server port is busy, `ima2-gen` falls back to the next available port and records it in `~/.ima2/server.json`. If the port is unexpectedly `3457`, your shell may also have inherited `PORT=3457` from another local tool. Run `unset PORT` or start with `IMA2_PORT=3333 ima2 serve`.

**Port `10531` is already used on Windows**
Some Windows security tools, including `AnySign4PC.exe`, may occupy the default OAuth proxy port. Current builds track the actual fallback OAuth port. If you still need a manual override, start with `IMA2_OAUTH_PROXY_PORT=11531 ima2 serve` and check `ima2 doctor`.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lidge-jun/ima2-gen.git
cd ima2-gen
npm install
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

`npm run dev` builds the UI and starts the TypeScript server entry with `--watch` and verbose server diagnostics. `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build:server`, and `npm run build:cli` verify the TypeScript migration and package emit path. Node mode and Canvas Mode are part of the packaged UI by default.
