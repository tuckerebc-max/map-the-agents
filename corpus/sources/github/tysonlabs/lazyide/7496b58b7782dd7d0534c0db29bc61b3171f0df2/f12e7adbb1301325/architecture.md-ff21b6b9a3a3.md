## Key Design Decisions

**Single App struct, split `impl` blocks.** All application state lives in one `App` struct defined in `app.rs`. Methods are spread across `app/*.rs` files using Rust's multiple-impl-block feature. This avoids borrow checker issues that arise when sub-state structs have their own `&mut self` methods needing cross-access.

**Two editor panes via state swap.** The focused pane's tab group is `App::tabs` / `App::active_tab` plus its geometry (`editor_rect`, `tab_bar_rect`, `tab_rects`, `wrap_width_cache`). The other pane keeps the same fields in `App::other_pane: Option<Pane>`. `focus_other_pane()` swaps them, so the 180+ call sites that operate on "the active tab" never learn about panes. Rendering draws the other pane through the same `render_editor_pane()` by swapping in, drawing with `focused = false`, and swapping back. A file is open in one pane at a time; the few paths that must see every tab (autosave, git refresh, LSP diagnostics, rename retargeting, dirty check, wrap rebuild) use `all_tabs()` / `all_tabs_mut()`.

**UI never mutates state.** The `draw()` function and all `render_*` functions in `ui/` take `&App` (or clone data from it) and only write to the `Frame`. State mutations happen exclusively in `app/` methods.

**Keybindings are data-driven.** ~40 actions are defined in the `KeyAction` enum. Default key mappings are in `KeyBindings::defaults()`. User overrides layer on top from `~/.config/lazyide/keybinds.json`. The `lookup()` method resolves a `KeyEvent` to a `KeyAction` in two passes: first requiring modifiers (including Shift on character keys) to match exactly, then falling back to a lenient match that ignores Shift, so `ctrl+shift+f` and `ctrl+f` stay distinct in terminals that report Shift while a stray uppercase still hits the plain binding.

## Event Loop

```
lib.rs: run_app()
  loop {
    app.poll_lsp()          // Check for LSP responses (non-blocking)
    app.poll_fs_changes()   // Check file watcher (debounced 120ms)
    app.poll_autosave()     // Write dirty buffers every 2s
    terminal.draw(|f| draw(&mut app, f))  // Render frame
    if app.quit { break }
    event::poll(100ms)      // Wait for terminal event
      Key  -> app.handle_key(key)
      Mouse -> app.handle_mouse(mouse)
  }
```

## Input Routing

`handle_key()` in `app/input.rs` routes events top-to-bottom by priority:

1. **Modal overlays** (keybind editor, file picker, prompts, completion, search results, context menus, theme browser, command palette, help) — first open modal wins
2. **Pending actions** (quit confirmation, delete confirmation)
3. **Global keybinds** — `keybinds.lookup(key, Global)` -> `run_key_action()`
4. **Non-remappable keys** (Esc, Tab for focus switch, Delete in tree)
5. **Focus-specific** — `Focus::Tree` -> `handle_tree_key()`, `Focus::Editor` -> `handle_editor_key()`

Inside `handle_editor_key()`, editor-scoped keybinds are checked before falling through to `tui_textarea::Input` for basic text editing (arrow keys, typing characters, etc.).

## Rendering Pipeline

`draw()` in `ui/mod.rs` builds the frame in layers:

```
1. Layout         3-row vertical: top bar | main content | status bar
2. Main split     If file tree open: [tree | editor], else [editor]. The editor's
                  left border doubles as the draggable divider and is redrawn
                  with junctions in the first pane's focus color. When split, the
                  editor column is divided by `App::pane_layout` (ratio in
                  `split_ratio`) and each pane renders its own tab row + block.
3. Top bar        "lazyide  root: ..." (branch and file live in the status bar)
4. File tree      ListWidget with TreeItem names, indent by depth
                  Files colored by git status (theme git_modified/git_added,
                  untracked=muted), directories inherit highest child status
5. Tab bar        Its own row above the editor block: active tab underlined in
                  the accent color, × close buttons, ● dirty marker, click rects
                  stored in app.tab_rects / app.tab_bar_rect
6. Editor         Line-by-line rendering inside a 1-char horizontal padding
                  (App::editor_inner_rect, which also excludes the minimap
                  column when App::minimap_shown()), 11-char gutter:
                    - Line number (5 chars)
                    - Fold indicator (triangle, 2 chars)
                    - Diagnostic marker (colored dot, 1 char)
                    - Git marker (+/~/-, 1 char, theme git_added/modified/deleted)
                    - Gutter separator │ + space (2 chars)
                    - Syntax-highlighted text with indent guides (│ at 4-space tab stops)
                    - Horizontal scroll clipping (when word wrap off, via clip_spans_by_columns)
                    - Cursor row highlight, selection highlight
                    - Fold summary ("... [N lines]")
                  Minimap (render_minimap): 12-column strip at the right edge,
                  one ━ bar per row sized by the longest line it covers, viewport
                  rows on bg_alt, cursor row in accent; click/drag scrolls
                  (App::scroll_to_minimap_row). Hidden under 70 columns or via
                  Alt+I (persisted in state.json as `minimap`).
7. Status bar     ui/status_bar.rs — left: focus chip + git branch +/-; center:
                  status message (5s TTL) > breadcrumbs of open file > keybind
                  hints; right: Ln/Col, ● errors ▲ warnings, UTF-8, Wrap
8. Overlays       Modals rendered last (on top): menus, prompts, help, etc.
                  Each gets a 1-cell drop shadow (helpers::clear_with_shadow).
```

## LSP Integration

`lsp_client.rs` manages a rust-analyzer child process:

- **Spawn**: `LspClient::new_rust_analyzer()` starts the process, initializes JSON-RPC
- **Background reader**: A thread reads stdout, parses `Content-Length` headers, sends parsed `LspInbound` messages to a channel
- **Polling**: `app.poll_lsp()` calls `rx.try_recv()` each frame, matching response IDs to pending requests
- **Requests**: `send_request()` returns an ID; the response is matched later via `pending_completion_request` / `pending_definition_request` fields

Supported LSP methods: `initialize`, `textDocument/didOpen`, `textDocument/didChange`, `textDocument/didSave`, `textDocument/completion`, `textDocument/definition`, `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`.

## Theme System

Themes are JSON files with color definitions. Loading priority:
1. `themes/` directory (local, for development)
2. System paths (`/opt/homebrew/share/lazyide/themes/`, etc.)
3. Embedded themes via `include_dir!("$CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR/themes")` (fallback, always available)

Each theme defines: background, foreground, accent, selection, border colors + syntax colors (comment, string, number, tag, attribute) + bracket pair colors (yellow, purple, cyan) + git colors (green/yellow/red from `colors`, falling back to the `terminal` palette, then ANSI defaults).

## Syntax Highlighting

Lightweight, line-at-a-time highlighting in `highlight_line()`. No AST — just keyword matching, string/comment detection, and bracket depth tracking. Supports 11 language families detected by file extension.

Bracket colorization uses a depth counter computed per-file in `compute_fold_ranges()`, cycling through 3 theme-defined colors.

## File Tree

The tree is a flat `Vec<TreeItem>` built by `walk_dir()` (depth-first). Each item stores its `depth` for indentation. Expanded state is tracked in a `HashSet<PathBuf>`. The tree is rebuilt on file system changes (via `notify` crate watcher with 120ms debounce).

## Git Integration

Git status is computed by shelling out to `git` (no libgit2 dependency):

- **Branch**: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` → top bar display
- **File statuses**: `git status --porcelain -z` → NUL-separated parsing for safe handling of paths with spaces/special characters. Statuses propagate up to parent directories (Modified > Added > Untracked priority, matching VS Code behavior).
- **Line statuses**: `git diff HEAD -- <file>` → unified diff hunk parsing. Falls back to `git status --porcelain` for untracked files (all lines marked Added). Stored per-tab in `Tab.git_line_status`.
- **Change summary**: `GitChangeSummary` counts (modified/added/untracked) shown in top bar as `Δ: ~M +A ?U`.
- **Diff view**: `diff::git_diff_for_file` runs `git diff HEAD -- <file>` (untracked files become all-added) and `parse_unified_diff` pairs removed/added runs into `DiffRow`s; `ui/overlays.rs::render_diff_view` draws them side by side with hunk headers. `app/git_diff.rs` owns the keys (n/p hunks, Enter jumps) and `Alt+N`/`Alt+P` change jumps via `diff::next_change_row` over the gutter statuses.
- **Refresh triggers**: file open, file save, and FS change events. FS refresh uses path-aware event coalescing — only affected tabs recompute line status, with full fallback for `.git/` changes or ambiguous events.

## Testing

Tests are inline with source using `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`. Run with:

```bash
cargo test              # all tests
cargo test keybind      # tests matching "keybind"
cargo test syntax       # tests matching "syntax"
```

300 tests cover keybindings, syntax detection, highlighting, folding, theme loading, LSP message parsing, git diff/status parsing, indent guides, and utilities.

## Adding a New Feature

1. Add any new types to `types.rs` (or the relevant domain module)
2. Add state fields to `App` in `app.rs`
3. Implement logic in the appropriate `app/` submodule
4. If it needs a keybind: add a `KeyAction` variant, wire it in `run_key_action()`, add a default in `KeyBindings::defaults()`
5. Add UI rendering in `ui/mod.rs` or `ui/overlays.rs`
6. Write tests in the same file under `#[cfg(test)]`
7. Update `README.md` keyboard shortcuts if applicable
