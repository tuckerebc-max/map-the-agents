Not an IDE. Not a terminal emulator. **Vim for agent management.**

Pane manages AI coding agents without replacing them. If it runs in a terminal, it runs in Pane — instantly, with zero integration. Claude Code, Codex, Cursor Agent, Aider, Goose, or any CLI tool. No plugins, no SDK, no waiting for support.

---

## Why Pane Exists

AI coding agents are incredible. Claude Code can work autonomously for hours. Codex can ship features end-to-end. Aider can refactor entire modules. The models are not the bottleneck.

**The way you interact with them is.**

Managing AI agents right now feels like air traffic control with a walkie-talkie. You're juggling terminal windows. Copy-pasting between tabs. Losing track of which agent is on which branch. Alt-tabbing between your diff viewer, your terminal, your git client, and your editor. The agents are fast — but your tools make you slow.

And then there's git worktrees. Everyone agrees worktrees are the right way to run parallel agents — isolated branches, no conflicts, clean separation. But actually using them? It's miserable. `git worktree add`, `git worktree remove`, remembering paths, tracking which worktree is on which branch, cleaning up stale ones, rebasing back to main, squashing commits before merging. Even experienced developers fumble the workflow. It's powerful infrastructure with terrible UX.

Pane makes worktrees invisible. You create a session, Pane creates the worktree. You delete a session, Pane cleans it up. You hit a shortcut, Pane rebases from main. You never type `git worktree` again. All the isolation benefits, none of the pain.

---

## What Flying Feels Like

Each of these is a small thing. Together they compound fast.

| Feature | | |
|---|---|---|
| **Pane Chat** | A global orchestrator terminal that starts in the Pane data directory, loads local Pane orchestration skills, and can coordinate Claude, Codex, or Cursor across repositories, panes, tabs, worktrees, and review loops. | <a href="#pane-chat">Details</a> |
| **Remote Pane** | Run panes, worktrees, terminals, files, git state, and approval prompts on a self-hosted remote machine while controlling them from desktop Pane or the browser app at [runpane.com/app](https://runpane.com/app/). | <a href="#remote-pane">Setup</a> |
| **Agent-Operable CLI** | Pane ships with `runpane agent-context`, `runpane repos add`, and `runpane panes create`, so a coding agent can discover Pane's command schema, register a repo, and open follow-up panes for issues or tasks. | [Contract](docs/RUNPANE_CLI_CONTRACT.md) |
| **@mention Terminals** | Type `@` in any terminal to pull the last 500 lines from another pane's terminal directly into your context, no copy-paste required. | <img src="images/qol-at-mention.png" alt="Cross-terminal @mention picker" width="420"> |
| **Clipboard Shortcuts** | `Ctrl+Alt+[key]` pastes any saved text snippet instantly, so your most-used prompts are one keystroke away forever. | <img src="images/qol-clipboard.png" alt="Terminal clipboard shortcuts popover" width="280"> |
| **Terminal Popover** | Highlight any text in a terminal and an intelligent popover offers the right action: copy, open in browser, or show in explorer. | <img src="images/qol-terminal-popover.png" alt="Terminal text selection popover" width="420"> |
| **Built-in Browser** | Preview any URL in a tab next to your terminals so every pane can see its own running dev server without alt-tabbing. | <img src="images/qol-browser.png" alt="Built-in browser tab previewing a local dev server" width="420"> |
| **Resource Manager** | Built-in CPU and memory monitor broken down per pane and per process, so you can catch a runaway agent before it eats your laptop. | <img src="images/qol-resource-manager.png" alt="Built-in resource manager" width="420"> |
| **Status Cues** | Every AI pane reports its state at a glance — a red dot when an agent is blocked waiting on your approval, an amber pulse while it works, and a "done" cue when it finishes while you're looking elsewhere. The same rollup colors the project dots and pane tabs, so a whole screen of parallel agents reads in one glance. | <img src="images/qol-status-dots.png" alt="Session agent status dots: blocked, working, done" width="280"> |
| **Jump + Refresh** | Jump to top, jump to bottom, or hard-refresh any terminal from the toolbar to unstick a frozen state in one click. | <img src="images/qol-jump-refresh.png" alt="Terminal jump and refresh controls" width="120"> |
| **Auto Secrets Copy** | Every pane automatically mirrors `.env` files and secrets from your root project so your worktree is runnable the moment it's created. | |
| **Isolated Ports** | Each pane runs on its own port range automatically, so you can spin up five dev servers in parallel without a single conflict. | |
| **Terminal Rendering Patches** | Claude Code's scroll-jump bug (long conversations snapping to top when you scroll up) is fixed here, even though it's still broken in Claude Code itself. | |
| **Drag and Drop** | Drop any file up to 50MB into a terminal and it lands exactly where you need it. | |

## Remote Pane

Run agents on a VM, WSL box, home server, desktop, Mac mini, or cloud machine while you keep the Pane UI on your laptop or phone. Remote Pane is self-hosted and open source: the host machine runs the repos, terminals, git state, files, agent credentials, and compute; the client just connects with a `pane-remote://...` code.

The easiest setup path is in the app:

1. Install Pane normally on the machine that should host your projects and agents.
2. Open `Settings > Remote Pane` on that host machine.
3. Set it up as a remote host and copy the generated `pane-remote://...` connection code.
4. On another desktop, open Pane, go to `Settings > Remote Pane`, paste the code, and connect.
5. On a phone or tablet, open [runpane.com/app](https://runpane.com/app/), paste the same code, and connect.

For a headless VM or server, use `runpane`:

```bash
npx --yes runpane@latest install daemon --label "My Server"
```

pnpm:

```bash
pnpm dlx runpane@latest install daemon --label "My Server"
```

Python tools:

```bash
pipx run runpane install daemon --label "My Server"
```

Use SSH instead of Tailscale:

```bash
npx --yes runpane@latest install daemon --label "My Server" --prefer-tunnel ssh
```

The hosted shell installers remain available:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://runpane.com/install-remote.sh | sh -s -- --label "My Server"
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://runpane.com/install-remote.ps1))) -Label "My Server"
```

The CLI setup command prints the same connection code and, for SSH mode, the forwarding command. See the [Remote Daemon docs](https://runpane.com/docs/remote-daemon) for the full step-by-step setup, mobile install instructions, API key notes, and security model.

## Pane Chat

Pane Chat is the global orchestrator terminal for a Pane workspace. It is not tied to a repository or worktree. It starts from the Pane data directory, reads a generated local runtime context, and uses the `runpane` CLI to inspect and operate the workspace.

Use it for the work that spans panes:

```text
Add this repo, create three worktree panes for the next features, start Codex in each one, and keep a separate review tab ready for every PR.
```

Pane Chat keeps the human discussion at the orchestrator level, distills that into concrete briefs when needed, then delegates authorized lifecycle stages to Claude, Codex, or Cursor panels through RunPane. The active agent's cached `runpane-orchestrator` is the canonical source for the software-work lifecycle, authorization ledger, review-feedback interrupts, current-head evidence rules, and `ready_to_merge` predicate. Pane's generated layer stays focused on the local Pane runtime, skill cache paths, pane/panel/worktree mechanics, and preserving the user's focus.

The prompt stays small because Pane writes local project-level skills into the Pane data directory:

- `.codex/skills/pane-orchestrator/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/pane-orchestrator/SKILL.md`
- `.cursor/rules/pane-orchestrator.mdc`
- `skills/pane-chat/runpane-orchestrator.md`
- `skills/pane-chat/runtime-context.md`

Pane also caches the important workflow skills from the Pane skills repository, including discussion, plan/simple-plan, implement, implementation-reviewer, PR test automation, prepare-pr, `gh-address-comments`, investigate, and commit. The generated orchestrator skill tells Pane Chat to load the workflow map and local skill cache before it coordinates work, while deferring lifecycle policy to the cached active-agent `runpane-orchestrator` so Pane does not maintain a second, drifting copy of the workflow.

The top-right toggle switches Pane Chat between Claude, Codex, and Cursor and persists the default orchestrator agent in Pane settings. All three share the same Pane-specific orchestration contract, then follow their own cached downstream skills where the agent skill surfaces differ.

---

## Agent-Operable CLI

Pane is not just a place where agents run. It exposes a stable `runpane` CLI contract that agents can use to manage the workspace for you.

For example, you can ask an agent to create panes for a set of GitHub issues and start Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or any terminal command in each one. The agent can inspect the available Pane commands, register the current repository if needed, and create panes with initial instructions:

```bash
runpane agent-context
runpane repos list --json
runpane repos add --path /path/to/repo --yes --json
runpane panes create --repo active --name issue-252 --agent codex --prompt "Kick off the discussion skill for issue 252" --yes
```

`runpane agent-context` is token-efficient by default and prints only command names, arguments, and safe usage notes. Agents can lazy-load full details for a specific command with `runpane agent-context --command "panes create" --json`.

Pane can also manage a short `AGENTS.md` block in saved repositories so agent CLIs know the developer is using Pane and can discover the CLI contract without bloating their context.

See [Runpane CLI Contract](docs/RUNPANE_CLI_CONTRACT.md) for the full schema and automation examples.

---

## How It Works

Two primitives: **panes** and **tabs**. One pane per feature, one worktree each. Inside every pane, everything lives in tabs — agents, diff viewer, file explorer, git tree, logs, multiple terminals. Create a pane, get an isolated workspace. Delete a pane, everything cleans up. Your agents never step on each other, and every tab persists across restarts.

Your agents already talk to Linear, Jira, GitHub, and Slack through MCPs and CLI tools. The terminal is the universal integration layer. Pane doesn't re-integrate what your agents already access — it gives them a place to run.

Pane also lets those agents operate the workspace itself. With the `runpane` CLI, an agent can list saved repositories, register a new repo, create panes, open terminal-backed agent tabs, and seed the first prompt. That means "set up panes for these issues and start the discussion skill" can be one instruction, not a manual UI checklist.

Other tools build custom chat UIs that only work with agents they've explicitly added support for. Pane gives every agent a real terminal. "Future CLI agent support" isn't a roadmap item here — it's the default. You bring the agents, Pane makes them fly.

2. **Create a pane** — enter a prompt and pick your agent
3. **Add tabs** — launch a Claude, Codex, or Cursor terminal, diff viewer, file explorer, or any CLI tool
4. **Work in parallel** — create multiple panes for different approaches
5. **Review diffs** — see what changed with the built-in diff viewer
6. **Ship** — commit, rebase, and merge from keyboard shortcuts

---

## The Windows Problem

The Windows developer experience for AI coding tools is broken across the board:

- **Claude Desktop on Windows** crashes repeatedly. Requires manual Hyper-V and Container feature enablement. Windows App Runtime dependencies aren't auto-installed.
- **Claude Code on Windows** is non-functional when your Windows username contains a period — standard in enterprise Active Directory environments.
- **Conductor** is Mac-only. No Windows version exists. The founder publicly said Windows support is "hopefully soon-ish."
- **Claude Squad** has a hard dependency on tmux, which doesn't exist on Windows.
- **Claude Code Agent Teams** requires tmux or iTerm2 for split panes. Explicitly not supported in VS Code terminal or Windows Terminal.

Windows has roughly 70% of the developer desktop market. Linux has another 5-10%. Mac has about 25%. The entire AI coding tool ecosystem is building for that 25%.

Pane is for the other 75%. And for Mac developers who want to choose their own agents.

---

## Who Pane Is For

- **Developers on any OS**: Mac, Windows, and Linux are all first-class citizens, with no "Mac-first with a Windows waitlist"
- **Multi-agent users** who run Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Aider, or Goose depending on the task and want one app to manage them all
- **Keyboard-driven developers** who want Superhuman-level speed in their AI-assisted coding workflow
- **Teams** where different engineers use different agents and need a consistent workflow layer
- **Anyone tired of juggling terminal windows**, alt-tabbing between diff viewers and git clients, or waiting for agents one at a time

## What Pane Is Not

Pane is not your editor. Not your terminal. Not your agent.

It replaces the chaos. The twelve terminal windows. The alt-tabbing. The mental overhead of tracking which agent is on which branch. The frustration of tools that don't work on your OS.

Pane replaces the mess with a single, fast, keyboard-driven surface. It's the thing you wish tmux was.

---

## How Pane Is Different

| | Pane | Superset | Conductor | Claude Squad | Cursor/Windsurf |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Platform** | Win + Mac + Linux | Mac (unofficial Win/Linux) | Mac (Apple Silicon only) | Unix (tmux) | Win + Mac |
| **Agents** | Any CLI | Any CLI | Claude + Codex | Any (tmux) | Built-in only |
| **Diff Viewer** | Built-in, syntax-highlighted | Built-in | Built-in | None | Editor-level |
| **Git Workflow** | Commit, push, rebase, squash, merge — all keyboard | Worktrees + merge | Worktrees + PR | Worktrees only | Editor-level |
| **Keyboard-First** | Every action | Partial | Partial | Terminal only | IDE shortcuts |
| **Open Source** | Yes (AGPL-3.0) | Yes (Apache-2.0) | No | Yes | No |
| **Session Persistence** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | N/A |

Every tool in the AI coding space either only works on Mac, only works with one agent, is a terminal hack that requires tmux, treats Windows as an afterthought, or wants to be your editor, your terminal, and your agent all at once.

Pane is the only tool that is a real desktop app, agent-agnostic, cross-platform with every OS as a first-class citizen, keyboard-first, and git-native. That combination doesn't exist anywhere else.

---

## FAQ

**"Isn't this just tmux with extra steps?"**
tmux is from 2007. Pane is a modern desktop app with a built-in diff viewer, file explorer, git workflow, command palette, browser tab, resource manager, persistent state, cross-terminal context sharing, and (unlike tmux) it works on Windows. tmux is a terminal multiplexer; Pane is a workstation for managing AI coding agents.

**"What if a new AI agent comes out tomorrow?"**
You just run it. Pane doesn't bundle agents or lock you in. If it runs in a terminal, it runs in Pane, instantly. No plugins, no SDK, no waiting for support.

**"Do I have to know how git worktrees work?"**
No. Pane creates and tears down worktrees automatically when you create or delete a pane, so you get all the isolation benefits without ever typing `git worktree`.

**"Can I run multiple agents in parallel without them stepping on each other?"**
Yes. Each pane gets its own worktree, its own port range, and its own copy of your secrets. Five agents, five isolated workspaces, zero conflicts.

**"Why is it called Pane?"**
Because you look through a pane to see what's happening. Each pane is a window into an agent's work.

**"Why Electron?"**
Pane uses xterm.js, the same terminal engine that powers VS Code's integrated terminal. Same rendering, same reliability, with 50,000 lines of scrollback. Electron also powers VS Code, Slack, Discord, and Figma.

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dcouple/Pane.git
cd Pane
pnpm run setup
pnpm run electron-dev
```

### Production Builds

```bash
pnpm build:win:x64    # Windows (x64)
pnpm build:win:arm64  # Windows (ARM64)
pnpm build:mac        # macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel)
pnpm build:linux  # Linux (x64 + ARM64)
```

### Releasing

```bash
pnpm run release patch   # 0.0.2 -> 0.0.3
pnpm run release minor   # 0.0.2 -> 0.1.0
pnpm run release major   # 0.0.2 -> 1.0.0
pnpm run release 2.2.1   # explicit version when package.json and tags diverge
```

Run releases only from a clean `main` checkout that matches `origin/main`. The release script refuses inferred bumps when `package.json` and the latest `v*` tag disagree; use an explicit version after deciding the intended next release. See [Release Instructions](docs/RELEASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for the workflow and required GitHub checks.
