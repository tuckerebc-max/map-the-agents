> A multi-provider desktop terminal for AI coding CLIs, organized around a flat **repo → session** workflow.

**OmniDesk** is an Electron-based desktop application that wraps AI coding CLIs (Claude Code, Codex CLI, and more) in a clean, fast terminal shell. Switch repositories from a left activity bar, navigate the sessions inside each repo from a session rail, and run every session in a full xterm.js terminal — focus a single session, or view them all at once in a grid.

## Features

### Repo → Session Workflow
- **Activity bar** — switch between repositories from the left rail; drag repos together to form groups
- **Session rail** — per-repo list of sessions for fast navigation
- **Focus & Grid modes** — focus a single session full-screen, or view all sessions in a repo as live tiles
- **Right inspector** — collapsible panel with per-session details (provider, branch, working directory)

### Multi-Session Management
- **Multiple concurrent sessions** per repository
- **Named sessions** for better organization — and sessions you don't name **auto-rename to the agent's live task summary** (sourced from the CLI's terminal title; a name you type, at creation or via rename, is never touched)
- **Session persistence** — sessions are restored after an app restart
- **Pre-warmed session pool** for fast session creation
- **Per-session launch mode picker** (Claude) — choose between `claude`, `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`, or `claude agents` (the Claude Code 2.1.139+ background-session TUI) at creation time, gated by an automatic CLI availability probe
- **Plain terminal sessions** — pick the **Terminal** session type to run an ordinary shell (no AI CLI) for `git`, builds, and everyday commands. Create one standalone, or spawn one seeded to an agent's working directory via **Open terminal here** on the session context menu

### Multi-Provider Support
- **Pluggable provider layer** — swap between Claude Code, Codex CLI, and future providers
- **Provider selector** in the new-session sheet — choose Claude or Codex for each agent session
- **Provider badges** on sessions to distinguish non-default providers
- **Auto-detection** — providers register automatically based on installed CLI binaries

### Worktree-Aware Sessions
- **Open any folder** — add a git repository or a plain (non-git) folder; when the folder isn't a repo, OmniDesk offers to initialize git
- **Create a session on a new git worktree/branch, an existing branch, or the current checkout**
- **Background git operations** — status, branches, and worktree management run in the main process (no separate Git panel to manage)
- **Optional cleanup** — remove the worktree/branch when you close the session

### Command Palette & Repo Switcher
- **Command palette** (`Ctrl/Cmd+K`) for quick actions — new session, switch to Focus/Grid, toggle the inspector, add a repository
- **Search sessions across every open repo** — the palette matches session names from all your open repositories at once, so you can jump straight to any session without switching repos first
- **Repo switcher** (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+K`) to jump between repositories and their sessions

### Attention Cockpit
- **Live session status** on the rail — each session is classified (`working` / `awaiting-approval` / `errored` / `done` / `idle`) rather than a single "running" state
- **"Who needs you" cockpit** (`Ctrl/Cmd+J`) — a cross-repo overlay listing sessions that need attention, with Jump/Dismiss (and a Ship-it shortcut for finished sessions), **how long each session has been waiting**, keyboard shortcuts with on-row hints, plus a "N need you" pill in the status bar and background toasts for backgrounded sessions
- **Agent "needs you" alerts via the terminal bell** — when an agent CLI rings its bell (Claude Code: turn finished, question waiting), the session is flagged `awaiting-input`, fires a toast with Jump, and counts in the pill. Typing in the session clears it. **Requires the CLI's bell channel** — for Claude Code add `"preferredNotifChannel": "terminal_bell"` to your `~/.claude/settings.json` (or profile settings)
- **Current scope** — shell sessions are classified from a rolling output-tail + quiescence timer; agent sessions (Claude Code, Codex) are classified from their **rendered screen content** — a headless `ScreenModel` (`@xterm/headless`) takes settled snapshots of the terminal's alt-screen buffer and feeds them to the provider's `getStateSignals()` table, yielding the same `working` / `awaiting-approval` / `awaiting-input` / `done` / `errored` states as shells. The terminal bell (`BareBellDetector`) still supplies the `awaiting-input` needs-you signal for agents alongside the screen-driven classification.

### Session History & Checkpoints
- **Session History Explorer** (`Ctrl/Cmd+K → "Session history…"`) — browse the transcripts of past sessions, newest first, with the full transcript view for any recorded session
- **Cross-session content search** — search the *content* of every recorded session at once (debounced, optional case sensitivity) and jump to matches
- **"While you were away" recap** — a per-session digest of what happened since you last looked, shown in the history panel and as a glance row on the live session pane; agent sessions report real approval-prompt and error counts (shell sessions show "not tracked" instead of a misleading 0)
- **Export, delete, stats & retention** — export any transcript as Markdown or JSON, delete individually or all at once, see storage stats, and set a retention policy
- **Checkpoints panel** (`Ctrl/Cmd+K → "Checkpoints…"`) — create named checkpoints of a session's context, edit their details, export them as Markdown/JSON, and delete them

### Quota Awareness
- **Burn-rate indicator** in the status bar, backed by the Anthropic API quota service
- **Per-account quota mapping** — track quota separately across multiple Claude accounts on one machine. Set `quotaAccountMap` in settings to an ordered list of `{ pathContains, configDir }` rules; the first rule whose `pathContains` matches a session's working directory (case-insensitive) picks which Claude config directory its quota is read from. With no mapping configured, every session reads `~/.claude` (unchanged default)

### Voice Prompting (Speech-to-Text)
- **Dictate prompts instead of typing** — click the mic button in the terminal (or press `Ctrl+Shift+Space`) to start recording, click/press again to stop
- **Fully on-device** — transcription runs a local Whisper model (via transformers.js WASM) in a sandboxed background process; audio never leaves your machine, no cloud service, no API keys
- **Review before sending** — the transcript appears in an editable overlay so you can fix wording before it's injected into the terminal
- **Live feedback** — an audio-reactive equalizer while recording, so a muted or dead mic is immediately obvious
- **Model choice** — pick `tiny.en`, `base.en` (default), or `small.en` from the voice settings panel (`Ctrl/Cmd+K → "Voice / speech-to-text settings…"`); the model downloads once, with your consent, and is cached locally
- Right-click the mic button to hide it; disabled for remote (browser) clients

### Remote Access
- **Reach OmniDesk from any browser** — the same UI runs on your phone, tablet, or another computer, driving your live sessions
- **One-click managed tunnel** — OmniDesk runs a Cloudflare tunnel for you (auto-downloads `cloudflared` on request); no manual terminal setup
- **Live mirror** — output fans out to every connected device; type a prompt anywhere and it shows up everywhere, with terminal history replayed on connect
- **Token-secured** — binds `127.0.0.1` only and enforces its own access token (cookie + WebSocket check); off by default
- **One-scan sign-in + installable PWA** — a QR whose link embeds the token signs you in on one scan, and you can **Add to Home Screen / Install** for a full-screen app that stays signed in across launches
- **Built for touch** — on a phone the UI switches to a focused mobile layout: a drawer to **switch between projects and sessions** (and open a new project) over a full-screen terminal. Tapping the terminal raises the keyboard, and an on-screen key bar sends Esc, Tab, Ctrl-combos, arrows, and newline so you can actually work from a phone
- Open it from the activity-bar tunnel button or `Ctrl/Cmd+K → "Remote access…"`

### Integrations
- **Get pinged where you already are** — push session alerts out to **Telegram, Slack, Discord, or a generic (HMAC-signed) webhook** when a session needs you: a question is waiting, approval is needed, it errored, or it finished. Alerts are edge-triggered and debounced, so you get a heads-up, not a firehose
- **Per-event and per-repo control** — toggle which events notify you, and mute noisy repositories individually
- **Tap the alert, land on the session** — while a remote tunnel is running, notifications carry a deep link that opens the exact session in the remote PWA on your phone
- **Ship it from a finished session** — turn a completed session into a GitHub PR (via the `gh` CLI): preview, then explicitly create — one PR per branch, never auto-created
- **Pull work in from GitHub issues** — pick an issue from the palette and OmniDesk opens a new session on a `feat/<n>-<slug>` branch with the issue body pre-loaded as the starting prompt (typed in, never auto-submitted)
- **Fleet digest** (off by default) — an optional periodic summary of what your sessions are doing, skipped when everything's idle
- **Test pings + delivery badges** — verify each connector with a one-click test and watch delivery status live
- Configure it from the activity-bar bolt button or `Ctrl/Cmd+K → "Integrations…"`

### Terminal Features
- **Full xterm.js terminal** with rich text formatting
- **Clickable links** — URLs are automatically detected and open in your browser
- **Copy/paste support** with keyboard shortcuts
- **Newline insertion** — in agent sessions, `Ctrl/Shift/Alt/Cmd+Enter` inserts a literal newline without submitting
- **Ctrl+C guard** — in agent sessions, a confirmation dialog prevents accidentally exiting the CLI; in plain terminal sessions, `Ctrl+C` passes straight through to interrupt the running command
- **Kitty keyboard protocol** — accurate key/modifier encoding, negotiated automatically when the running CLI requests it
- **Obsidian dark theme** with the JetBrains Mono font

## Prerequisites

Before installing OmniDesk, ensure you have:

1. **Node.js 20+** — [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Claude Code CLI** — Install via:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```
   Or follow the [official installation guide](https://claude.ai/claude-code)
3. **Claude API credentials** — OmniDesk reads from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (set up by Claude CLI)

> **Optional:** install the [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) to enable the Codex provider — OmniDesk detects it automatically.

> **Remote Access (optional):** no extra install needed — OmniDesk offers to download `cloudflared` for you when you start the managed tunnel. Requires an internet connection for the Cloudflare tunnel. If you run from source, launch via `npm start` (not a dev command) so the built UI exists for the remote server to serve.

## Architecture

OmniDesk uses a **3-layer pattern per domain**: Manager (main process) → Hook (renderer) → Components (renderer).

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Main Process (Node.js)                     │
│  ~7 managers + IPC handlers + session pool  │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                   │ IPC (115 methods)
┌──────────────────┴──────────────────────────┐
│  Preload (auto-derived context bridge)      │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                   │
┌──────────────────┴──────────────────────────┐
│  Renderer (React 18)                        │
│  Hooks → Shell components → Terminal        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The **IPC contract** (`src/shared/ipc-contract.ts`) is the single source of truth — one entry auto-derives the channel, the preload bridge method, and the TypeScript types. A **provider abstraction** (`IProvider`) decouples CLI specifics from session management, so adding a new AI CLI is a self-contained provider.

```

## Development

```bash
npm install              # Install dependencies
npm run electron:dev     # Dev mode with hot reload (renderer)
npm test                 # Run all 1418 tests
npm run test:watch       # Watch mode
npm run test:e2e         # E2E tests (local only — requires a built app)
npm run test:coverage    # Coverage report
```

> **Note:** `npm run build` rebuilds only the renderer. The main process is built separately by `npm run build:electron`. `npm start` chains both before launching Electron — useful before running E2E tests, which load the built `dist/main/index.js`.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development guidelines.

## Privacy & Security

- **Local-first** — all session data is stored on your machine
- **No telemetry** — no usage data is collected or transmitted
- **Minimal external services** — network calls are limited to: Anthropic's API (quota/burn-rate), GitHub (app update checks via `electron-updater`), your configured git remotes (clone/fetch/push), and Hugging Face (one-time, user-consented voice model download). Nothing else is contacted.
- **Voice stays local** — speech-to-text runs entirely on-device; audio is never uploaded anywhere
- **Credential security** — reads Claude CLI credentials locally, never logs or stores them

For more details, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

---

## Known Issues

- **Windows**: `cmd.exe` is used as the default shell. Ensure `claude` is in your PATH.
- **macOS**: Requires macOS 10.13+ (High Sierra or later).
- **Linux**: May require `libxtst6` and `libnss3` packages.
