# Changelog

All notable changes to OmniDesk will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Homebrew/Chocolatey packaging for easier installation
- Development dependency security updates (electron v40+, vite v7+)

---

## [2.7.1] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- **Recap at a glance on the live session pane.** The "while you were away" recap now also appears as a compact row on the session pane itself — not just in the history panel — refreshing whenever you switch sessions.
- **Real approval & error counts in session digests.** The recap's approval-prompts and errors-detected figures are now computed by replaying the session's recorded output against the provider's own state-signal patterns. When a count genuinely can't be derived (e.g. shell sessions), it shows "not tracked" rather than a misleading 0.

---

## [2.7.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- **Session History Explorer.** A new panel (`Ctrl/Cmd+K → "Session history…"`) for browsing the transcripts of past sessions: a newest-first session list with the full transcript view, **cross-session content search** (search what was said in every recorded session at once), and **export / delete / stats / retention** actions — export any transcript as Markdown or JSON, delete individually or all at once, view storage stats, and configure a retention policy. History entries now also record which provider ran the session.
- **"While you were away" recap.** The history panel shows a per-session digest of what happened since you last looked, backed by a new session digest service.
- **Checkpoints panel.** Manage session checkpoints from the UI (`Ctrl/Cmd+K → "Checkpoints…"`): create named checkpoints, edit their details, export them as Markdown or JSON, and delete them.
- **Cockpit wait durations & keyboard control.** Attention cockpit rows now show how long each session has been waiting for you, and the cockpit gained keyboard shortcuts for Dismiss and Ship-it with on-row shortcut hints.
- **Screen-driven agent classification.** Agent sessions (Claude Code, Codex) are now classified from their rendered screen content — a headless terminal model takes settled snapshots of the alt-screen buffer and feeds them to the provider's state-signal table — so full-screen, continuously-repainting TUIs get the same `working` / `awaiting-approval` / `awaiting-input` / `done` / `errored` states as plain shells.

### Fixed
- **Approval alerts no longer downgraded.** Outbound integration notifications for agent sessions awaiting approval say so, instead of being softened to "needs your input".
- **Toast queue drop.** A queued toast could be silently dropped when a toast was removed twice; the queue now survives the double-remove.

### Changed
- Broader test coverage: worktree error classification, remote static-file serving, ConfirmDialog keyboard confirm, provider capability caching, repo group management, and the speech-to-text engine handle.

---

## [2.6.1] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- **Per-account quota mapping is now configurable.** Split quota tracking across multiple Claude accounts on one machine by setting `quotaAccountMap` — an ordered list of `{ pathContains, configDir }` rules that maps a session's working directory to the Claude config directory its quota is read from. The previously hardcoded work/personal path split is gone; with no mapping configured every session reads `~/.claude` (unchanged default). The resolver stays on the hot path's fast, I/O-free route.

### Fixed
- **Git argument-injection hardening.** Branch names, worktree paths, and commit-diff hashes are now guarded so a value beginning with `-` can no longer be interpreted as a `git` flag — closing injection vectors in `switchBranch`/`createBranch`, `addWorktree`/`removeWorktree`, and `commitDiff`.
- **Path & scheme allow-listing.** History export paths are now gated through the allowed-path check, and `file://` was dropped from the schemes `openExternal` will launch.
- **Session preview correctness.** Per-session preview state is pruned when a session ends (no leaked state), and carriage-return progress-bar frames are collapsed so previews no longer show stacked/garbled progress lines.
- **Quota fetch ordering.** `useQuota` now ignores out-of-order fetch responses, so a slow earlier request can't overwrite fresher quota data.
- **Drag cleanup.** A stuck cursor / text-selection state is reverted when a dragged element unmounts mid-drag.
- **Integrations UI.** Integration checkbox rows get their own layout class so they render correctly.

### Changed
- Broader test coverage: direct unit tests for the model-token safety check (`isSafeModelToken`/`MODEL_TOKEN_PATTERN`), `ConnectorRegistry`, `TunnelController` lifecycle branches, and worktree path naming.

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- **Outbound integrations — get pinged where you already are.** Push session alerts to **Telegram, Slack, Discord, or a generic HMAC-signed webhook** when a session needs you (a question is waiting, approval is needed, it errored, or it finished). Alerts are edge-triggered and debounced, with per-event toggles and per-repo mutes. While a remote tunnel is running, each alert carries a deep link that opens the exact session in the remote PWA on your phone. Configure it from the activity-bar bolt button or `Ctrl/Cmd+K → "Integrations…"`.
- **GitHub ship-it & issue intake.** Turn a finished session into a pull request via the `gh` CLI — preview, then explicitly create (one PR per branch, never auto-created). Or pull work the other direction: pick a GitHub issue from the palette and OmniDesk opens a new session on a `feat/<n>-<slug>` branch with the issue body pre-loaded as the starting prompt (typed in, never auto-submitted).
- **Optional fleet digest.** An opt-in periodic summary of what your sessions are doing, automatically skipped when everything is idle.
- **Search sessions across every open repo.** The command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+K`) now matches session names from all open repositories at once, so you can jump to any session without switching repos first.
- **Next / previous session shortcuts.** Cycle through the active repo's sessions with `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+]` and `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+[`.

### Changed
- Burn-rate calculation was refactored into a pure, independently testable function, and test coverage was broadened across quota, checkpoints, IPC handlers, the Claude detector, and file utilities; shared ANSI-stripping is now a single helper.
- `package.json` now declares supported engines (Node ≥ 20, npm ≥ 10), the build job uses `npm ci`, and README version/test badges are dynamic.

### Fixed
- **Integrations robustness:** connector fetches are now bounded by a timeout, `Retry-After` values are clamped and validated, attention state is released when a session ends, Slack control characters are escaped and Discord mentions suppressed, over-long Discord/Telegram messages are truncated to API limits, exited sessions no longer inflate the idle-digest count, and per-repo mutes match by true path containment.
- **Security & input validation:** models are validated against an allowlist before any shell interpolation (both the Claude and Codex providers), new-session working directories are gated behind the allowed-path check, and Git file reads reject paths that escape the repository directory.
- **Terminal correctness:** UTF-16 surrogate pairs and multi-byte UTF-8 sequences stay intact across chunk boundaries (no more mangled emoji/CJK), POSIX shell path escaping was consolidated and corrected, and relocating pooled Windows shells no longer triggers `cmd.exe` `%VAR%` expansion.
- **Sessions, git & worktrees:** restart is properly guarded against races, the session pool restores correctly after being disabled and re-enabled, worktree metadata reconciles its OmniDesk/linked-session fields, ship-it detects the real default branch, unstaged changes surface on renamed-then-modified/deleted files, and a missing `.git/index` watcher error handler was added.
- **Quota & misc:** burn-rate trend is normalized by elapsed time and fed the real 5-hour rate, palette search matches action subtitles, checkpoint export truncates by stored byte offset, provider permission modes are unified, interrupted legacy-config migrations retry, stale remote-auth rate-limit entries are pruned, a blocking `execSync` at startup was replaced with an async version probe, Caps-Lock case is normalized in the shortcut handlers, and the new-session agent toggle is gated behind real availability.

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- **Attention cockpit — supervise your agents instead of babysitting them.** Every session now carries a live activity state (`working` / `awaiting-approval` / `awaiting-input` / `errored` / `done` / `idle`) surfaced across the app: rich status chips on the session rail, a cross-repo **"who needs you" overlay** (`Ctrl/Cmd+J`) with Jump/Dismiss, an **"N need you" pill** in the status bar, and toasts when a *backgrounded* session starts needing you. Full classification runs for plain terminal (shell) sessions.
- **Agent "needs you" alerts via the terminal bell.** When Claude Code rings its bell — turn finished, or a question is waiting — the session is flagged `awaiting-input`, fires a toast with a Jump button, and counts in the pill; typing in the session clears it. Detection is escape-sequence-aware (title/clipboard sequences that end in the same byte never false-alarm), verified byte-for-byte against a live Claude Code session. Requires the CLI's bell channel: for Claude Code set `"preferredNotifChannel": "terminal_bell"` in your settings.
- **Sessions auto-rename to what the agent is working on.** Sessions you don't explicitly name pick up the CLI's live task summary from its terminal title (e.g. "Fix login bug") and update as the work changes. A name you type — at creation or via rename — is never touched, and that choice survives restarts. Shell sessions and junk titles are excluded.

### Changed
- Architecture docs, README feature docs, and contributor workflow notes refreshed; repo workflow now requires worktree-per-task branching from an up-to-date `main`.

### Fixed
- **Session lifecycle trust fixes (cockpit foundation):** crash-on-launch is no longer silently dropped by pooled sessions (no more sessions stuck at "starting"), a crashed session is reported as `error` rather than a clean exit, and stale/replaced PTY managers can no longer feed or tear down a live session.

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- **Voice prompting (speech-to-text).** Dictate prompts instead of typing: click the mic button in the terminal (or press `Ctrl+Shift+Space`) to start recording, click again to stop. Transcription runs a local Whisper model fully on-device — no cloud service, no API keys, audio never leaves your machine. The transcript opens in an editable review overlay (auto-grows for long dictations) before being injected into the terminal, and a live audio-reactive equalizer shows the mic is actually hearing you while you speak. Configure it — enable/disable, pick a model (`tiny.en` / `base.en` / `small.en`), download with one click — from `Ctrl/Cmd+K → "Voice / speech-to-text settings…"`. The model downloads once with your consent and is cached locally. Right-click the mic button to hide it. Desktop only (disabled for remote browser clients).

### Fixed
- **Ghost text in Windows terminal scrollback.** Long Claude sessions on Windows could leave fragments of old frames (stray spinner/status-line prefixes) frozen in the terminal's scrollback, caused by ConPTY mis-coalescing incremental repaints. Sessions now use the bundled Windows Terminal ConPTY plus full-repaint/synchronized-output modes, which also cuts session startup output delay from ~3s to ~200ms.

---

## [2.3.2] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- **Garbled terminal on session startup.** New sessions launched into a fixed 80×24 terminal before the real window size was known, so the CLI's opening screen could appear garbled or sized wrong until a manual resize. The CLI now launches at the true terminal size from the first frame.
- **Terminal stuck at stale rows.** On a cold start the CLI could stay drawn at the wrong height — input floating mid-screen with blank space below — until you manually resized or reselected the session. It now repaints at the correct size once ready, and restarting a session runs the same correct-size startup as a fresh one.
- **Mobile layout overlap.** On phones, the top bar could sit under the status bar and the terminal could run beneath the on-screen key bar; both now stay clear.

### Changed
- Documentation refreshed (README remote-access prerequisites and contributor workflow notes).

---

## [2.3.1] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Switch projects and sessions from your phone.** The mobile drawer now lists your open projects with their sessions grouped beneath — tap a project to switch to it, tap any session (in any project) to jump straight to it, and open a new project without leaving the phone.

### Fixed
- **Mobile drawer rendered behind the terminal.** The slide-out drawer was clipped to a thin strip because the terminal painted over it; it now opens as a full-height panel over the session.

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Mobile-ready remote access.** Opened on a phone, OmniDesk now switches to a focused mobile layout — a session drawer over a full-screen terminal — instead of the cramped desktop panels. Tapping the terminal raises the soft keyboard, and an on-screen key bar sends the keys a CLI needs but a touch keyboard lacks: Esc, Tab, sticky Ctrl (e.g. `Ctrl+C`), arrows, newline, common symbols, and paste. The view reflows as the keyboard opens so your prompt stays visible.
- **PWA safe-area + icon polish.** The installed app respects device safe areas (notch / home indicator) via `viewport-fit=cover`, reflows for the on-screen keyboard, and ships a maskable 192px icon.

### Changed
- The desktop app is unchanged — the mobile experience activates only for remote browser/PWA clients on a touch device.

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Remote access.** Reach OmniDesk from any browser — your phone, tablet, or another computer — and drive your live sessions. OmniDesk serves its own UI over a **one-click managed Cloudflare tunnel** (offers to download `cloudflared` for you), enforces its own access token, and binds to `127.0.0.1` only. Session output mirrors live to every connected device, and terminal history replays when a device connects mid-session. Off by default — open it from the activity-bar tunnel button or `Ctrl/Cmd+K → "Remote access…"`.
- **Installable PWA.** Scan the QR to sign in on one tap, then **Add to Home Screen / Install** for a full-screen app with its own icon. The access token is now persistent, so an installed app (or saved QR) stays signed in across OmniDesk restarts; a "Regenerate token" button rotates it on demand.

### Changed
- Documentation refreshed across README, CONTRIBUTING, the repo index, and CLAUDE.md.

---

## [2.1.1] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- **Shell (Terminal) sessions now render their output.** A plain terminal opened as a blank pane — its shell prompt and command output were held back by the Claude-readiness output buffer, which waits for a Claude welcome box that a shell never produces. Shell output now renders immediately.

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Shell sessions** — a new plain-terminal session type that runs an ordinary shell (`cmd.exe` on Windows, your login shell on macOS/Linux) with no AI CLI. Choose the **Terminal** type in the New Session sheet to create one standalone, or use **Open terminal here** on an agent session's context menu to spawn a shell seeded to that agent's working directory. In a shell session, `Ctrl+C` passes through to interrupt the running command; agent sessions keep the close-confirm guard.
- **Kitty keyboard protocol support** — the terminal negotiates and speaks the Kitty keyboard protocol when the running CLI requests it, giving accurate modifier and key encoding.
- **Open non-git folders** — add a plain folder that isn't a git repository; OmniDesk offers to initialize git when the folder isn't already a repo.

### Changed
- Migrated the terminal renderer from `xterm` to `@xterm/xterm` 5.5.

---

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed
- Starting a new session in **Existing** worktree mode on the repository's current branch no longer fails with a git error ("'main' is already used by worktree at ..."). The session now runs in the main checkout, matching what the New Session sheet previews.

---

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-23

A ground-up redesign. OmniDesk is now built around a flat **repo → session** shell, and a large amount of panel-based functionality has been removed in favor of a focused terminal-orchestration experience. **This is a breaking release** for users who relied on the removed features.

### Added
- **Phase 4 shell** — a flat **repo → session** UI replacing the panel-based design: a left activity bar for switching repositories (with drag-to-group), a per-repo session rail, and a terminal host that fills the main view. **Focus** mode shows one session full-screen; **Grid** mode shows every session in a repo as live tiles, with a collapsible right inspector for per-session details.

### Changed
- Reworked keyboard shortcuts for the new shell: `Ctrl/Cmd+N` (new session), `Ctrl/Cmd+K` (command palette), `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+K` (repo switcher), `Ctrl/Cmd+1` / `Ctrl/Cmd+2` (Focus / Grid), `Ctrl/Cmd+.` (toggle inspector).
- The command palette is now an action launcher (new session, switch view, toggle inspector, add repo) rather than a prompt-template browser.
- **Git, history, and checkpoints are now backend-only** — their managers, IPC, and persistence remain (they are load-bearing dependencies), but the panel UIs were removed.
- Rewrote the README, CONTRIBUTING, and SECURITY docs and replaced every screenshot to match the new shell.
- CI now runs the Electron packaging job only on pushes to `main`, not on pull requests — release packaging is handled by the release workflow on `v*` tags.

### Fixed
- The repository drag-to-group highlight in the activity bar now clears reliably on `dragend`, even when a child element misses its `dragleave` / `drop` event.

### Removed
- The panel-based design and the split-view / multi-pane layout system, replaced by Focus / Grid modes.
- UI for: the Git panel, Agent Teams (Team Panel, Task Board, Message Stream, Agent Graph), real-time session sharing (LaunchTunnel relay, share codes, observers, `omnidesk://join` deep links), the Repository Atlas Engine, Repo Tasks, custom commands, prompt templates, session playbooks, the settings dialog, the model switcher, and the fuel-status UI.
- The `reactflow` dependency (only used by the removed Agent Graph).
- `design.v2.*` feature flags — the redesign is now unconditional.

---

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- **Launch mode picker now actually changes the spawned command.** v1.4.0 shipped the picker UI and the main-process plumbing, but `launchMode` was silently dropped at three renderer function boundaries (`TabBar.onCreateSession`, `App.handleCreateSession`, `useSessionManager.createSession`) before reaching the IPC body — so selecting `claude agents` or the non-bypass default always produced `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`. Threaded the field through the full renderer chain and added a regression test at the `useSessionManager` boundary asserting the IPC body carries `launchMode` when callers pass it.

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Per-session launch mode picker** in `NewSessionDialog` for the Claude provider — choose between `claude` (default), `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`, or `claude agents` (the Claude Code 2.1.139+ background-session TUI) at session creation time. Previously the dangerous-skip-permissions toggle was a single app-wide setting; now it's per-session.
- **`claude agents` mode** is gated by an automatic main-process probe of `claude --version` (5s timeout, runs off the synchronous startup path) plus two kill switches — the `disableAgentView` setting in `~/.claude/settings.json` and the `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AGENT_VIEW` env var. When unavailable, the option is disabled with a tooltip explaining why.
- The existing global "bypass permissions" setting still seeds the picker's *default* selection — back-compat preserved.

### Changed
- Renderer now subscribes to a `agentView:availabilityChanged` push event from main instead of polling — the picker's `claude agents` state reflects the probe result without a poll loop.

### Fixed
- macOS CI flake on the task-manager external-edit test caused by `fs.watch` behavior under Bun + macOS-latest GitHub Actions runners (the test now skips on `darwin`; production behavior is unchanged). Proper fix — extracting the watcher callback into a directly testable seam — tracked as a follow-up.

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Repo Tasks** — per-repo personal todo list backed by `.omnidesk/tasks.md` in the workspace
- Tasks side panel with inline add, checkboxes, editable titles, optional notes, and auto-sinking completed items
- Quick capture overlay bound to `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+T` — add a task from anywhere without leaving the active session
- File watcher with 200ms debounce so edits the active AI session makes to `.omnidesk/tasks.md` propagate to the UI in real time
- Stable task ids via `.omnidesk/tasks.meta.json` sidecar — task ids survive title edits while the markdown file stays free of metadata noise
- Per-repo mutex serializing concurrent writes; markdown round-trip is byte-stable so non-task content (headings, prose) is preserved

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **Directory listing and folder creation for workspaces outside the user's home directory** — recent security hardening restricted filesystem IPC operations to `$HOME`, which broke workspaces on other drives (e.g. `F:\projects`). Users saw empty directory lists and "Failed to create folder" errors when creating sessions. Paths under any configured workspace are now also allowed, with case-insensitive comparison and separator normalization on Windows.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Custom Commands** — user-defined and project-scoped commands with a full parameter system (string, number, boolean, select, multiline) including defaults and validation
- Custom command management UI in Settings panel — create, edit, delete, import/export commands
- Custom commands integrated into the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) alongside prompt templates
- Security hardening for custom commands — input sanitization, path traversal protection, and size limits
- Comprehensive test suite for custom commands (unit + security tests)

### Fixed
- `Ctrl+Shift+C` now correctly copies selected text from the terminal (was relying on browser-native copy which doesn't see xterm.js selections)

---

## [1.1.5] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- Release workflow no longer fails on duplicate `builder-debug.yml` uploads — only `latest*.yml` manifests are included

---

## [1.1.4] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- Auto-update check now works — release workflow includes electron-updater manifest files (`latest.yml`) in GitHub Release assets

---

## [1.1.3] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- Ctrl+Shift+C now copies selected text from the terminal (was incorrectly opening the Checkpoint panel)
- Checkpoint panel shortcut reassigned to Ctrl+Shift+K
- Added Checkpoints entry to keyboard shortcuts panel under Panels section

---

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- Auto-update support via electron-updater with GitHub Releases integration
- "Check for Updates" button in About dialog now functional with status feedback

### Changed
- App icon updated from old "C" letter to new BrandMark hexagon (installer, taskbar, all platforms)
- "View on GitHub" in About dialog now opens in system browser instead of Electron window
- Icon generation script updated to use BrandMark SVG with built-in ICO builder (no external deps)

---

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- Newline insertion in terminal via Ctrl+Enter, Shift+Enter, Alt+Enter, or Cmd+Enter
- `/preflight` command — runs CI-equivalent checks locally before pushing
- `/ship` command — full workflow: branch, preflight, commit, push

### Changed
- Disabled LaunchTunnel and session sharing features (commented out, pending LaunchTunnel service fixes)
- Removed non-functional kebab menu (3 dots) from PaneHeader in split view
- Hidden "Join Session" card from empty state when sharing is unavailable
- `/release` command now auto-checkouts to `main` and pulls latest instead of blocking
- Removed proof PNGs from repository and gitignored them

### Fixed
- Unused `IPCEmitter` and `extractDeepLinkCode` imports causing CI type check failures

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- Clickable terminal URLs now open in the system browser via `shell.openExternal`
- Home-directory path validation on `writeFile`, `listSubdirectories`, and `createDirectory` IPC handlers (security hardening)
- 6 new Obsidian design tokens in `tokens.css`

### Changed
- Complete design system migration from Tokyo Night to Obsidian palette across the entire UI (~1,275 updated occurrences)
  - Replaced bare hex values, old-palette references, and `var()` fallback hex values
  - Migrated xterm.js terminal theme to Obsidian colors
  - Fixed WCAG AA contrast on ShortcutsPanel category headers
  - Removed dead CSS classes from `App.tsx`
- CI/CD pipelines switched from npm to bun, added type checks, gated packaging on tests, added code signing env vars

---

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **CI Electron download 403** — Electron's `install.js` downloads binaries from GitHub and was getting rate-limited (403 Forbidden) without authentication. Added `GITHUB_TOKEN` env to `npm ci` steps in the release workflow.

---

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Windows .exe missing from releases** — Release workflow artifact upload and GitHub Release globs used `*Setup*.exe` which didn't match the custom `artifactName` template (`${productName}-${version}-${arch}.${ext}`). Changed to `*.exe` so the NSIS installer is correctly uploaded and published.

---

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **Share panel sync on stop/start** — `SharingManager.stopShare()` now emits `onShareStopped` and `startShare()` emits `onShareStarted`, keeping all `useSessionSharing` hook instances in sync. `ShareSessionDialog` hydrates from main process on open. New `ShareStartedEvent` type + `sharing:shareStarted` IPC event.
- **Git status cross-panel leak** — `GitManager` now populates `workDir` on status-change events; `useGit` filters `onGitStatusChanged` by `projectPath`; `GitPanel` cleans up watcher on unmount/projectPath change. New `workDir?` field on `GitStatus` type.

### Changed
- **IPC contract** — Expanded from ~191 to ~192 methods (added `sharing:shareStarted` event)
- **Test count** — 483 → 487 tests across 33 test files
- **Documentation screenshots** — Updated 5 screenshots (create-session, fuel-status-side-panel, main-screen, settings-workspace, work-space-layout)

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **Linux build failure** — electron-builder derived `.deb` output path from scoped npm name, creating non-existent `release/@carloluisito/` directory. Added `artifactName` template and `linux.executableName` to fix artifact paths and desktop integration naming.

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **npm package name** — switched to scoped `@carloluisito/omnidesk` (unscoped `omnidesk` was taken)
- **npm repo link** — added `repository` field to `package.json` for GitHub sidebar linking

### Changed
- **Release artifacts** — renamed from `claudedesk-*` to `omnidesk-*`

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-27

Version reset to 1.0.0 — marks the official start of OmniDesk as an independent product. The GitHub repository has been renamed from `carloluisito/claudedesk` to `carloluisito/omnidesk`. This release consolidates all changes from v5.0.0 and v5.0.1 under the new versioning.

### Added
- **Multi-provider abstraction** — Pluggable provider layer decoupling CLI specifics from session management
  - `IProvider` interface (`src/main/providers/provider.ts`) defining command building, env vars, model detection
  - `ProviderRegistry` with auto-registration of built-in providers
  - `ClaudeProvider` (default) and `CodexProvider` (OpenAI Codex CLI)
  - Provider selector dropdown in NewSessionDialog (shown when >1 provider available)
  - `[CX]` tab badge for Codex sessions
  - `useProvider` hook with conditional UI (hides Claude-only features for non-Claude providers)
  - 3 IPC methods (`provider:*`): list, available, capabilities
  - `src/shared/types/provider-types.ts`: `ProviderId`, `ProviderCapabilities`, `ProviderInfo`
- **OmniDesk rebrand** — Renamed ClaudeDesk → OmniDesk across all branding, config, UI
  - Config directory migrated from `~/.claudedesk/` to `~/.omnidesk/` with automatic migration
  - Centralized `config-dir.ts` with `CONFIG_DIR`, `ensureConfigDir()`, `migrateFromLegacy()`
  - `managedByClaudeDesk` → `managedByOmniDesk` (backward compat read on existing worktrees)
- **Real-time session sharing** — Share live terminal sessions with remote teammates via LaunchTunnel relay
  - `SharingManager` managing host and observer WebSocket lifecycles (`wss://relay.launchtunnel.dev/share/<id>`)
  - Binary frame protocol with 12 frame types (`0x10`–`0x1B`): TerminalData, TerminalInput, Metadata, ScrollbackBuffer, ControlRequest/Grant/Revoke, ObserverAnnounce/List, ShareClose, Ping/Pong
  - Share via tab right-click context menu; generates share code + URL
  - Observers join read-only with scrollback buffer (5000 lines, gzip-compressed)
  - Control request/grant/revoke flow for observer input
  - Metadata broadcast (2s interval), keepalive ping/pong, automatic reconnect
  - Deep link support: `omnidesk://join/<code>` via `app.on('second-instance')` (Windows) and `app.on('open-url')` (macOS)
  - Sharing gated behind LaunchTunnel Pro subscription
  - Observer Ctrl+C (`\x03`) stripped from TerminalInput frames (same safety rule as local sessions)
  - `ShareSessionDialog`, `JoinSessionDialog`, `ObserverToolbar`, `ObserverMetadataSidebar`
  - `ShareManagementPanel`, `ShareIndicator`, `ControlRequestDialog`
  - `useSessionSharing` hook
  - `src/shared/types/sharing-types.ts` with full type definitions
  - 22 IPC methods (`sharing:*`)
- **UI redesign** — Tokyo Night design token system and new component library
  - `ActivityBar` (left sidebar navigation), `StatusBar` (bottom status strip), `SidePanel` (collapsible side panels)
  - New component library: `Button`, `Toast`, `ToastContainer`, `Tooltip`, `ProgressBar`, `StatusDot`, `BrandMark`, `ProviderBadge`
  - `tokens.css` (design token definitions), `animations.css` (shared animation keyframes)
- **`cleanupStaleShares()`** — New method that lists server-side share rooms (`GET /v1/shares`) and deletes any not tracked locally (orphan recovery from crashes or unclean shutdowns)

### Fixed
- **Orphaned share rooms** — `cleanupHostShare()` now sends a fire-and-forget `DELETE /v1/shares/{id}` to the server on all cleanup paths (app shutdown, unexpected WebSocket close, keepalive pong timeout), preventing orphaned share rooms that exhausted the concurrent room limit
- **TIER_LIMIT_EXCEEDED recovery** — `startShare()` now catches `TIER_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` errors, attempts to clean up stale server-side share rooms via `cleanupStaleShares()`, and retries the create if orphans were found
- **Test mock format** — Fixed all 16 sharing-manager test fetch mocks to match the actual API response wrapper format (`{ share: { id, share_code, ... } }`)

### Changed
- **IPC contract** — Expanded from ~166 to ~191 methods (16 domains)
- **Project scale** — ~160 source files, ~51,000 LOC, 16 domains, 16 managers, 483 tests across 33 test files
- **Version reset** — Repository renamed from `claudedesk` to `omnidesk`; version reset from 5.0.1 to 1.0.0

---

## [4.6.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **LaunchTunnel integration** — Expose local ports to the internet via LaunchTunnel (14th domain)
  - `TunnelManager` with hybrid REST API + CLI (`lt preview`) process management

  - 17 IPC methods (`tunnel:*`): 13 invoke + 4 events

### Fixed
- **Tunnel spawn ENOENT** — Use `shell: true` in spawn for cross-platform `.cmd` shim compatibility
- **Tunnel status mapping** — API returns `"active"` not `"connected"`; added to `mapApiStatus`
- **Tunnel CLI subcommand** — Fixed `lt preview --port` (was missing `preview` subcommand)
- **Tunnel URL parsing** — Match `URL:` output format from LaunchTunnel CLI (not `your url is:`)
- **API snake_case mapping** — Map `created_at`, `status_code`, `duration_ms` etc. to camelCase
- **Account response unwrapping** — API returns `{"user": {...}}` wrapper; now unwrapped correctly

### Fixed
- **Git generate button** — Action bar Generate now auto-opens CommitDialog with the generated message
- **CommitDialog generate button** — Directly sets title from return value instead of relying on fragile useEffect prop chain

  - Improved session spawning reliability and reduced complexity

---

## [4.1.1] - 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **IPC Abstraction Layer** - Refactored IPC architecture to define each method once and auto-derive everything else
  - New `ipc-contract.ts` — single source of truth for all IPC channels, args, and return types
  - New `ipc-registry.ts` — typed handler registration with automatic cleanup
  - New `ipc-emitter.ts` — type-safe main→renderer push events
  - Reduced `ipc-handlers.ts` from 602 to ~290 lines

---

## [4.1.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Full 4-pane split view support** - Users can now split panes individually up to 4 total panes
  - Added horizontal split button (⬌) to each pane header - splits pane left/right
  - Added vertical split button (⬍) to each pane header - splits pane top/bottom
  - Split buttons only appear when paneCount < 4
  - Blue hover effect distinguishes split buttons from close button
  - Enables complex layouts: 2x2 grids, 3-pane L-shapes, etc.

### Fixed
- **Split view limitation** - Previously, the toggle split button only supported switching between 1 and 2 panes. While the backend supported 4 panes, there was no UI to access this. Now users can create 3-4 pane layouts by splitting individual panes.
