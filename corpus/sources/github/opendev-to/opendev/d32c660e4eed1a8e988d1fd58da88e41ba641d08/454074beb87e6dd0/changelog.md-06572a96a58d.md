# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.9] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Embed the built web UI into the binary (rust-embed), so `opendev run ui`
  serves the frontend for `cargo install` and release-binary installs, not
  just repository checkouts (#183)
- Fall back to the built-in provider list in first-run setup and `/model`
  switching when the models.dev registry is empty or unreachable; keyless
  local providers (ollama, lmstudio) skip the API-key prompt (#109, #42)
- Offline / air-gapped usage documentation covering
  `OPENDEV_DISABLE_REMOTE_MODELS`, `OPENDEV_API_BASE_URL`, and
  `OPENDEV_MODELS_DEV_PATH` (#42)
- Display-width-aware soft-wrapping for long input lines in the TUI, with
  cursor scroll-into-view (#61)
- Post-release checksum-verification job that downloads every published
  artifact and diffs its SHA256 against the manifest, installer, and Homebrew
  formula (#41, #84)

### Changed

- Adopt the XDG Base Directory Specification (#45). Fresh installs use
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opendev` (settings, auth, agents, commands, mcp.json),
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opendev` (sessions, projects, plans, skills, memory,
  worktrees, snapshots), `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/opendev` (provider cache), and
  `$XDG_STATE_HOME/opendev` (logs, crash reports, debug recordings) on Linux,
  or the platform-native equivalents on macOS (`~/Library/Application
  Support/opendev`, `~/Library/Caches/opendev`). Existing `~/.opendev/`
  directories keep working unchanged (legacy mode), with a one-time
  deprecation notice logged per run. `OPENDEV_DIR` still overrides everything.
- Refreshed ROADMAP.md to reflect the Rust codebase and linked it from the
  README (#115)

### Fixed

- Non-interactive (`-p`) mode hanging indefinitely on Anthropic
  extended-thinking models: capture and echo back thinking signatures across
  multi-turn requests, disable the tool-approval channel when nothing drains
  it, and cap agent iterations (#103)
- Streaming LLM errors (invalid key, wrong base URL, unreachable host) being
  silently retried forever with no UI feedback; fatal errors now fail fast and
  the error is surfaced in the TUI and web UI (#13, #110)
- Web UI serving 404 on installed binaries because the static directory was
  resolved from a compile-time build path (#183)
- Session title generation panicking (exit 101) when a multibyte character
  straddled the truncation boundary (#110)
- Homebrew SHA256 mismatches: the release pipeline mutated archives after
  computing checksums, and staged a macOS-only microsandbox resource on all
  platforms; checksums are now recomputed after bundling and the formula
  resource is platform-scoped (#41, #84)
- All remaining hardcoded `~/.opendev` call sites now route through the
  centralized path abstraction, so fresh XDG installs no longer silently flip
  back into legacy mode when the TUI history, tool-output overflow, memory
  tool, crash reporter, recovery snapshots, worktrees, or web MCP editor
  write to disk (#45)
- `/models` picker read its model cache from `~/.opendev/cache` while the
  provider sync wrote to the XDG cache dir, showing "No models available" on
  fresh installs (#45)
- Global custom agents, slash commands, and skills are now discovered in the
  XDG config/data directories on fresh installs instead of only
  `~/.opendev/...` (#45)
- Flaky MCP stdio/connection tests that were deterministically broken by lost
  Python indentation during test extraction (#19)
- Credential-store persistence test failing on machines with
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set
