# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Add durable project-specific notes here as they are discovered through real work.

## Adding a supported agent

To add a new agent, mirror the `qwen` (or `freebuff`) entry end-to-end:
`SUPPORTED_AGENTS`/`AGENT_SHORTCUTS`/`AGENT_ALIASES`/`IMAGE_OVERRIDE_ENV_KEYS`
and `get_default_images()` in `src/vibepod/constants.py`, the `AGENT_SPECS`
entry in `src/vibepod/core/agents.py` (mount contract must match the
vibepod-agents image entrypoint; set `acp_command` when the agent ships an
ACP adapter, see `docs/acp.md`), the per-agent defaults in
`src/vibepod/core/config.py`, skills paths in
`src/vibepod/commands/run.py::_agent_skill_paths`, and the docs + tests
(`docs/agents/index.md`, `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, `docs/index.md`,
`docs/configuration.md`, `tests/test_{agents,cli,constants,run,task_cmd}.py`).
The local-image fallback (`VP_IMAGE_<AGENT>` override + pull-failure fallback
in `run.py`/`task.py`) is how an unreleased image is exercised locally.

Hermes is the exception to the `~/.agents/skills` convention: it reads that
directory only via the `skills.external_dirs` key in its own `config.yaml` and
has no env-var override, so the `vibepod-agents` image entrypoint seeds the key
rather than the CLI mounting a symlink.

Hermes also has two launch constraints enforced by `validate_rootless_runtime`
and the ACP reserved-path check: it is rejected on rootless Podman (the pinned
image needs its own runtime user and rejects the UID rootless keep-id maps the
container to, including 0), and `/opt/hermes` (its install root) is reserved so
an `--acp` workspace bind cannot shadow the entrypoint/venv/`hermes-acp`.

## Tests

Runner is `pytest` (`python -m pytest`); CI also validates default images with
`scripts/check_default_images.py`. The suite is hermetic only when the host
`~/.config/vibepod/config.yaml` is not read: run with a throwaway
`VP_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/...` when the host has a global config (its leaked
`agents.*.env` breaks `test_config.py`). `ruff check` + `ruff format --check`
and `mypy` are pre-commit gated.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
