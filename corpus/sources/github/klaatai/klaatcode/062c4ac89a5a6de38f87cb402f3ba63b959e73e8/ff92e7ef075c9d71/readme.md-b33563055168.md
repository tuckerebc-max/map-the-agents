## What is KlaatAI?

**KlaatAI** is an AI platform built around **Klaatu-o1**, a small, fast, agentic router model. Instead of sending every request to one large, expensive model, Klaatu-o1 reads what you're asking, decides which model tier actually needs to handle it, and dispatches accordingly — automatically, per request. Three products sit on top of it: **KlaatAI Web Chat** (browser), **Klaat Code** (this CLI), and the **KlaatAI API** for developers building on the same router directly.

## What is Klaatu?

**Klaatu** is the routing brain — a hosted service, not something that runs on your machine. Every message you send from Klaat Code goes to Klaatu, which classifies it and routes it through one of six cost tiers (`nano → fast → code → reason → heavy → titan`), escalating automatically when a task turns out harder than it looked, and never charging you frontier prices for a trivial turn. Tool calls inside a single request — reads, edits, shell commands, searches — are free; only your messages count against quota. This is also the architectural reason Klaat Code can be open source without giving away the thing that makes it good: **the client is a thin terminal to a service**, the same relationship `gh` has to GitHub. The intelligence — routing decisions, model health tracking, pricing, the code-graph index — lives server-side, at [klaatai.com](https://klaatai.com).

## What is Klaat Code, and how is it different?

Klaat Code is this repo: a terminal-native coding agent you install once and run in any project. It reads your code, edits files, runs commands, and verifies its own work — asking permission before anything risky. Functionally it sits in the same category as **Claude Code**, **opencode**, **Codex CLI**, and **Aider** — same agentic loop, same terminal-first philosophy — but six things are genuinely different:

1. **Smart per-request model routing.** None of the above route per-message to a cost tier the way Klaatu does. You get frontier-level reasoning when a task needs it and pay nano/fast prices for everything else, automatically — not a model you pick once per session.
2. **A real code knowledge graph**, not just grep. Your project is indexed into a call graph with semantic search; the agent queries symbols, callers, callees, and blast-radius instead of reading whole files — and `plan_exploration` uses that graph to plan the optimal file-read order *before* reading anything. Typically 5–15× fewer tokens per task.
3. **No Continue button, ever.** Claude Code and Windsurf stop every 20 tool calls and make you click Continue; on Klaatu, tool rounds are free and unlimited — only your messages count against quota. And when a loop is genuinely *stuck* (same call, same args, same result), the server detects it and the CLI breaks it with recovery guidance instead of billing you for repetition.
4. **Cost you can see and cap.** Real-time burn-rate monitoring (warns at 3× your session average), per-task cost attribution, per-phase token budgets that catch a stuck agent *before* it burns your budget exploring, a hard session cap, and `--max-cost` for CI. No other CLI watches spend rate.
5. **Context that knows what it forgot.** Compaction in every CLI silently loses things; Klaat Code snapshots your task and files before compacting, verifies the summary afterwards, and tells the model exactly what was lost and where to recover it. `/context` shows what's in the window vs. compacted away. Tool output is noise-filtered (progress bars, passing-test spam) before it ever costs you tokens.
6. **The comparison is reproducible.** The [benchmark below](#benchmarks) isn't a claim — clone this repo, run `bun run bench`, and verify the numbers yourself against the same fixtures we used.

What's new in each release: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Benchmarks

Same 33 fixtures, same prompts, same verify command, run against KlaatCode, Claude Code, opencode, Cursor, and Grok Build in one harness. Full methodology and honesty notes: [`bench/README.md`](bench/README.md). Interactive version with per-task drill-down: [klaatai.com/benchmarks](https://klaatai.com/benchmarks).

[![Cumulative benchmark cost — Klaat Code vs Claude Code, Cursor, and opencode](bench/promo/bench-curve-github.png)](https://klaatai.com/benchmarks)

Latest run — 2026-07-20, 33 tasks:

| Metric | Klaat Code (Klaatu-o1) | Claude (Sonnet 5) | Cursor (Composer 2.5) | Cursor (Composer 2.5 Fast) | opencode (Nemotron 3 Ultra) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Solved | **33/33** | 33/33 | 33/33 | 33/33 | 31/33 |
| Cost per solved task | **$0.027** | $0.146 | ~$0.047 est | ~$0.094 est | ~$0.048 est |
| Tokens per solved task | **51.7K** | 171.5K | ~86K | ~28.9K | 89.1K |
| Median time per task | **23s** | 16s | ~113s | ~12s | 26s |

**5.4× cheaper than Claude Code, 1.7× cheaper than the nearest rival, at a perfect solve rate — and no rival is both cheap and fast.** Agents near our cost are ~5× slower (Composer 2.5 standard: ~113s/task vs our 23s) or drop tasks; agents near our speed cost 3.5–5.4× more. Promo-free and subsidized lanes are normalized to published per-token rates so the comparison reflects real token cost (details in the honesty notes). Grok Build's refresh on this suite is pending an API rate-limit window; on the previous 30-task suite it solved 30/30 at ~$0.058 est.

Reproduce it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KlaatAI/klaatcode.git && cd klaatcode
bun install
bun run bench                              # klaatcode
bun bench/compare-agents.ts --agent claude # or opencode / grok / cursor
```

## Install

Pick any method — all install a standalone compiled binary (no Node or Bun runtime required at runtime):

**npm (Node ≥ 18 or Bun ≥ 1)**
```bash
npm install -g klaatcode
```
> **macOS `EACCES` error?** Prefix with `sudo`, or fix npm's global prefix once:
> ```bash
> mkdir -p ~/.npm-global && npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global
> echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
> ```

**One-line installer (macOS/Linux)**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://klaatai.com/api/install | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
irm https://klaatai.com/api/install-windows | iex
```

**Homebrew (macOS/Linux)**
```bash
brew install KlaatAI/klaatcode/klaatcode
```

All methods install both `klaatcode` and `klaatai` — identical commands, use whichever you like.

**Shell completions (bash / zsh / fish)**
```bash
# bash
klaatai completions bash >> ~/.bashrc

# zsh
mkdir -p ~/.zfunc
klaatai completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_klaatai
# ensure fpath includes ~/.zfunc, then: autoload -Uz compinit && compinit

# fish
klaatai completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/klaatai.fish
```

## Quick Start

```bash
klaatcode login                     # browser sign-in — your KlaatAI account, no API keys to manage
klaatcode                           # open current directory
klaatcode ~/projects/my-app         # open a specific project
klaatcode run "Fix all TS errors"   # headless / CI mode
klaatcode whoami                    # check auth
```

## Features

### Smart Model Routing

Each request is classified and routed to one of five auto-routed tiers by Klaatu (a sixth, `titan`, is opt-in only). You see which tier answered (badge in the header) and why.

```
/tier           # lock a tier, or open the picker
/tier smart     # restore automatic routing
/model          # switch between Klaatu and your own third-party models
/why            # explain the last routing decision
/cost           # session spend + what routing saved you
```

| Tier | Used for |
|---|---|
| `nano` | Trivial turns, completions |
| `fast` | Quick questions, small edits |
| `code` | Default — most coding work |
| `reason` | Debugging, architecture, tricky logic |
| `heavy` | Large refactors, hardest problems |
| `titan` | Kimi K3 (2.5T) — frontier power. Ask for it with `/tier titan`, or let the router escalate into it from `heavy`; it is never inferred from a prompt's wording. Pro and above, capped per day (Starter only during a promo window). |

The router escalates automatically when a task turns out harder than it looked and de-escalates when you don't need the big guns. The ladder is `nano → fast → code → reason → heavy → titan`: `titan` is the top rung, reachable by asking for it by name and as the one step above `heavy` when a turn keeps failing or outgrows the context. It de-escalates back to `heavy` when your daily cap is spent. Tool rounds, retries, and failovers are never billed — one user message = one request.

**Bring your own model.** Don't want Klaatu for a task? Add any OpenAI-compatible endpoint and switch to it per-session:
```
/model add gpt4o https://api.openai.com gpt-4o env:OPENAI_API_KEY
/model gpt4o
```

### Post-Edit Diagnostics — the Model Sees Its Own Mistakes

After a successful edit, Klaat Code runs your project's typechecker/linter on the changed file (auto-detects eslint/biome, ruff, gofmt, rubocop, swiftlint, phpstan/pint, ktlint, shellcheck, or a configured command) and hands any errors straight back to the model in the same turn — it fixes them before returning control to you, instead of costing you a round-trip.

### Terminal UI with Real Syntax Highlighting

Markdown responses render with per-language syntax highlighting directly in the terminal. Code blocks show language labels and are mouse-selectable (drag to auto-copy).

- Streaming responses with live token/cost counter
- Slash-command autocomplete — type `/` for a fuzzy-filtered live suggestion strip
- Collapsible tool output and thinking blocks — click to expand
- Full mouse support: click, scroll, drag-select
- 14 themes: `dark`, `light`, `dracula`, `nord`, `ayu`, `catppuccin`, `gruvbox`, `neon`, `synthwave`, `ember`, `matrix`, `cobalt`, `midnight`, `tokyo-night` (`/theme`)
- Vim keybindings (`/vimmode on`)
- Sidebar: usage, context window fill, MCP servers, routing analytics
- Diffs render as colored, syntax-highlighted unified-diff blocks — including multi-file patches

### Real Plan Mode

Switch to Plan mode (`Tab`) and the model gets only read-only tools — it researches and proposes a plan, you approve, it switches back to Build with the full toolset to implement. No accidental edits while you're just trying to think something through.

### Built-in Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `read_file` | Read files with line numbers, offset/limit for big files |
| `write_file` | Create/overwrite files (parent dirs auto-created) |
| `edit_file` / `multi_edit` | Surgical string replacement, single or batched atomic |
| `apply_patch` | Multi-file envelope-diff patch — add/update/delete/move, applied atomically |
| `glob` / `grep` / `list_dir` | Find files and search code |
| `run_command` | Execute shell commands (permission-gated) |
| `web_fetch` / `web_search` | Read pages, search the web |
| `todo_write` / `todo_read` | Persistent task list the agent maintains |
| `ask_user` | The agent can ask you a blocking multiple-choice question mid-task |
| `delegate_task` | Spawn a sub-agent for a scoped piece of work, optionally in the background |
| `task_status` | Check on or list background sub-agents |
| `plan_exploration` | Plan the optimal file-read order for a task from the code graph — before reading anything |
| `project_graph_query` | Query the code graph: symbols, callers, callees |
| `project_semantic_search` | Meaning-based code search (Pro) |
| `file_outline` | Symbol outline of a file without reading it all |
| `impact_check` | Blast-radius analysis: what breaks if this changes |
| `browser_*` | Navigate, read, and click pages (5 tools) |

### Multi-Agent Workflows

The agent can delegate scoped work to sub-agents with their own context — keeping your main conversation small and cheap. Sub-agent tool rounds are free like all tool calls.

```
> explore the auth and billing modules, then implement token refresh
✻ delegate_task: "map auth module structure" …
✻ delegate_task: "map billing module usage of tokens" …
```

Sub-agents can also run **in the background** (`background: true`): you keep chatting while they work, a `◔ N bg agents` chip tracks them, and results are injected into the conversation when they finish (`task_status` / `/agents` to check in).

### Context Management & Compaction

Long sessions stay affordable without losing the thread:

- **Every request** is mechanically compacted: thinking blocks stripped, stale tool output truncated by usefulness (superseded file reads and consumed search results trimmed hardest), oldest turns dropped last.
- **Command output is noise-filtered before it enters context**: progress bars collapse to their final frame, passing-test runs collapse to a count, repeated lines dedupe — failures and summaries always kept in full.
- **Older history is attention-ordered**: the most relevant surviving turns sit at the start and end of the window, where models actually attend ("lost in the middle" mitigation). Recent turns and the system prompt never move.
- **Compaction budget scales to your active tier's context window** — a session pinned to `nano` compacts harder than one on `heavy`, so requests never overflow the smaller model's window.
- **Automatic summarization** kicks in past the budget: the session is summarized on the cheapest tier into task state, files touched, and decisions, then the conversation continues seamlessly.
- **Compaction self-check**: critical state (your task, the files being modified) is snapshotted before summarizing and verified after — if the summary dropped something, a recovery note tells the model what it forgot and where to re-read it. No other CLI detects context loss.
- `/compact` triggers it manually; `/context` shows what's in the window vs. compacted away; the sidebar shows context-window fill so you're never surprised.
- Code-graph tools mean the agent rarely needs whole files in context in the first place.

### Cost Guards & Runaway Protection

The viral horror stories — $6,500 overnight bills, agents looping on the same failing call — can't happen here:

- **Burn-rate monitor**: warns when spend runs 3× your session average (a loop or an oversized context, caught live).
- **Per-task cost + phase breakdown** in `/cost`: see what each request cost and where the tokens went (explore / implement / verify).
- **Per-phase budgets**: exploration that burns its budget without producing a single edit pauses and asks — the stuck-agent signature, caught before the bill.
- **Hard caps**: `maxSessionCost` in config pauses agent rounds at your limit; `klaatcode run --max-cost 0.50` for CI/cron (exit code 3).
- **Doom-loop breaker**: the server flags identical repeated tool rounds; the CLI refuses them, injects recovery guidance, and stops after three strikes — while *productive* tool loops stay unlimited and free.

### Sessions

Every conversation is saved as a transcript in `~/.klaatai/sessions/`.

```
/sessions       # list saved sessions
/resume <id>    # pick up exactly where you left off
/export         # export session to Markdown (optional path)
/share          # alias for /export
```

### Permissions

Three-layer model — safe read-only tools run silently; everything else asks:

- **Allow once / this session / always / deny** prompts, persisted to `~/.klaatai/permissions.json`
- Glob allow/deny lists for shell commands (`rm -rf /`, fork bombs, etc. denied by default)
- Writes sandboxed to the project directory by default; hard-denied system paths (`/etc`, `~/.ssh`, …) refused even with the sandbox off

```json
{
  "allowed_commands": ["git status", "git diff *"],
  "denied_commands":  ["rm -rf /"],
  "trusted_tools": ["read_file", "glob", "grep"]
}
```

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Full MCP client, both transports:

- **stdio** — local servers, configured in `.klaatai/mcp.json`, built-in presets (filesystem, GitHub, Postgres, Puppeteer, Brave Search, Fetch, …)
- **Streamable HTTP** — remote servers via `"url"` config or `/mcp add <url>`; SSE and JSON responses, session management, and **OAuth 2.1** (discovery + dynamic client registration + PKCE browser flow) when the server requires auth — tokens cached in `~/.klaatai/mcp-oauth.json`

Manage live with `/mcp`.

### Git Integration

```
/diff           # show git diff
/review         # AI code review of current changes
/commit         # AI-generated commit message + confirm
/undo           # undo last AI file changes
/checkpoint     # snapshot project state
/rollback       # restore a checkpoint
```

### Skills — Reusable Prompt Templates

Save prompts as `.md` files, invoke by name. Project skills in `.klaatai/skills/`, global in `~/.klaatai/skills/`.

```
/skill list
/skill fix-types
/skill new fix-types     # create in $EDITOR
```

### Hooks — Lifecycle Automation

Run shell commands on agent lifecycle events. Hooks receive a JSON payload on stdin (tool name, arguments, result) plus `KLAATAI_*` env vars, can be scoped with a `matcher` regex, and `before_tool` hooks can **block** a tool call (exit code 2, or print `{"decision":"block","reason":"…"}`).

```json
// .klaatai/hooks.json
{
  "after_message": ["afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff"],
  "before_tool": [
    { "matcher": "run_command", "command": "./scripts/guard-shell.sh" }
  ],
  "after_tool":     ["notify-send \"$KLAATAI_TOOL_NAME done\""]
}
```

Events: `before_message` · `after_message` · `before_tool` · `after_tool`

### Project Rules

`.klaatai/rules.md` in your repo is injected into every session — coding standards, architecture notes, dos and don'ts. `/init` auto-generates one from your tech stack. `AGENTS.md` is also respected.

### Plugins

Custom tools as JavaScript modules — `~/.klaatai/plugins/*.js` (global) or `.klaatai/tools/*.js` (project). `/plugin list` · `/plugin reload`.

## Staying Up To Date

`klaatcode` checks for a newer release when it starts (cached 4h, fail-silent — offline never blocks a launch) and asks before doing anything:

```
Update available: v2.4.2 → v2.4.3
Update now? [Y/n]
```

Say yes and it upgrades through whichever channel installed it (npm, Homebrew, the install script, or the PowerShell installer), verifies the new binary actually reports the new version, and relaunches with your original arguments. Say no and it won't ask again for that release. If the upgrade command fails or the version doesn't change — usually a half-broken global install, or an old `klaatcode-ai` 1.x binary still winning on `PATH` — it falls back to a clean uninstall + reinstall, then tells you exactly what to run if even that fails. It never leaves you without a working CLI.

```bash
klaatcode upgrade          # upgrade now
klaatcode upgrade --check  # just report what's available
klaatcode --no-update-check   # skip the check for this run
```

Opt out permanently with `KLAATAI_NO_UPDATE=1`. The check is skipped automatically in CI and any non-interactive shell — those print one line to stderr instead of prompting.

Very old builds can be refused by the server (HTTP 426) after a breaking protocol change, with the upgrade command in the response. That floor is off unless a release note says otherwise; `KLAATAI_SKIP_VERSION_GATE=1` bypasses the client-side check at your own risk.

### What the CLI reports about itself

Every request carries four headers so we can tell how many installs are live and which builds are still out there:

| Header | Example | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `X-KlaatAI-Client-Version` | `2.4.3` | Version adoption; enforcing the minimum supported build |
| `X-KlaatAI-Platform` | `darwin-arm64` | Which platforms need testing/builds |
| `X-KlaatAI-Install-Channel` | `npm` | Which install channel to fix when upgrades fail |
| `X-KlaatAI-Install-Id` | random UUID | Counting installs — one chatty user is not a thousand installs |

The install id is a **random** UUID generated once and stored in `~/.klaatai/install-id`. It is not derived from your machine — no hostname, no MAC address, no hardware hash — and it identifies an install, not a person or a device. Nothing about your project is ever included: no paths, no repo names, no file names, no prompt or code content. Coarse country/city is derived server-side from the connecting IP, the same as any web request.

Opt out and no install id is sent at all, so no per-install record exists:

```bash
export KLAATAI_TELEMETRY=0     # or DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```

or in `~/.klaatai/config.json`:

```json
{ "telemetry": "off" }
```

Version and platform still travel when you opt out — the server needs them to refuse unsupported builds and route around version-specific bugs.

## How Authentication Works

Sign-in is browser-based OAuth against your KlaatAI account — there are no API keys to generate or paste. `klaatcode login` opens a browser tab, you authenticate with KlaatAI, and a short-lived JWT plus refresh token are stored locally in `~/.klaatai/credentials.json` (mode `0600`, never synced or logged). The CLI silently refreshes the token in the background and recovers automatically from expiry mid-session; `klaatcode logout` clears everything. Every chat request goes straight to Klaatu over HTTPS with that token — the server enforces your plan's quota and never proxies your credentials anywhere else.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for dev setup, the PR process, and what `bun run bench:selfcheck` needs to pass before a PR is reviewed.

## Security

Found a vulnerability? Please don't open a public issue — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for how to report it responsibly.

## Roadmap

- LSP tool (go-to-definition, find-references, rename) alongside the existing code graph
- Git worktree isolation for parallel/risky sub-agent work
- Published SWE-bench Verified scores
- Team-shared code graph, `klaat org` commands
