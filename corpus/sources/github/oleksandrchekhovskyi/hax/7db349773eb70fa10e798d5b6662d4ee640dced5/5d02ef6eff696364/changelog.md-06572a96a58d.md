notes (see [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md)).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A preset name right after `hax` starts with that preset: `hax review` is short for
  `hax --preset review`, and `hax review -p "..."` works the same way in one-shot mode.

### Changed

- Custom providers no longer take their models.dev catalog identity from their own name; set
  `catalog_id` explicitly (for example `"catalog_id": "groq"`) to keep pricing and context
  metadata. Local servers and proxies without one never contact models.dev. See
  [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md#custom-providers).
- `/model` and `/effort` wait briefly for the model catalog refresh, so pricing and context
  columns appear even on a cold cache.
- The collapsed preview for read-only bash commands now tolerates `echo`, `printf`, `true`, and
  `false` between exploration commands, such as the `echo ---` separators some models place
  between searches, and covers read-only git subcommands like `log`, `show`, `diff`, `status`,
  and `blame`, including behind global options such as `-C`.

### Fixed

- `config.json` and `state.json` are now written with a trailing newline, matching `auth.json`
  and session files.
- The brief history shown on resume now names the task a `task_wait` call waited on, as the
  live header does, instead of a bare `[task_wait]` line. Collapsed tool rows that need
  truncation now keep their suffix, such as a read's line range, like the full header does.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- `hax --json` (implies `-p`) streams new conversation records as JSONL, followed by a `result`
  record with the outcome, final text, cost, and session id. Plain `-p` output is unchanged, and
  the session-file schema is now a supported read surface. See [docs/sessions.md](docs/sessions.md).
- A resumed one-shot run no longer requires a prompt: `hax --resume=ID -p` (or `--json`)
  continues from where the conversation stopped.
- Codex `/login` now offers a local-browser OAuth flow for organizations that block device login;
  the device flow remains available for ssh sessions. See [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md#codex).
- Provider blocks accept `metadata_api` to select the `/models` protocol independently of the
  request protocol. All user-facing providers now also honor per-provider `sort_models` and
  `catalog_id` settings. See [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md#custom-providers).
- `extra_headers` can override or remove provider defaults and interpolate the stable
  `{session_id}` for gateways that route or cache by conversation. See
  [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md#request-passthrough).

### Changed

- Anthropic-protocol models on OpenCode Zen/Go and `anthropic-compatible` endpoints now use prompt
  caching and choose adaptive or budget thinking from model metadata, as first-party Anthropic now
  does. `thinking_mode` adds `auto` (the default) and `prefer-adaptive`.
- One-shot runs stop cleanly on signals: SIGINT or SIGTERM interrupts the run with status 130,
  while SIGUSR1 pauses at the next turn boundary. Completed work remains resumable, `--json`
  emits a final result when possible, and a second signal still kills immediately. See
  [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md#cli-modes).
- `max_turns` now bounds one-shot runs as well as interactive turns. Its default is `auto`:
  unlimited interactively and 100 in one-shot mode.
- Token counts and their `k`/`m` config suffixes now use decimal units; byte sizes remain
  1024-based. For example, `context_limit: "272k"` means 272000 tokens.
- `catalog.models` overrides now take precedence over live provider metadata and may be scoped by
  runtime provider id. This allows codex context overrides without changing OpenAI metadata; the
  model picker shows both the served window and its reported ceiling. See
  [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md#codex).
- Skill discovery now searches `.agents/skills` from the current directory to the repository root,
  then `~/.config/hax/skills` and `~/.agents/skills`; the nearest same-named skill wins. See
  [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md#project-instructions-and-context).
- Provider routing and prompt-cache keys now remain stable for a conversation across restarts.
  OpenRouter sends this id as `x-session-id`, and `/new` starts with a fresh id.
- The first-party `openai`, `anthropic`, and `openrouter` providers pin their protocol along
  with their endpoint: `providers.<id>.api` now warns instead of switching the wire. Use
  `model_apis` for per-model protocols, or a custom provider.
- The `providers.openrouter.title` and `providers.openrouter.referer` settings and their
  `HAX_OPENROUTER_*` aliases are gone; override or remove the attribution headers through
  `providers.openrouter.extra_headers`. See [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md#openrouter).

### Fixed

- OpenCode Zen and Go now send the required `x-opencode-session` header; requests without it may
  fail starting 2026-09-06.
- Chat Completions streams now retry upstream failures signaled through `error` or `network_error`
  finish reasons and report an error after retries, instead of returning an empty success.
- Interactively resumed interrupted conversations now show the resume hint and accept empty Enter
  to continue.
- OpenCode Go usage-window limits now surface immediately instead of triggering futile retries.
- The retry indicator shows the active attempt after backoff instead of remaining at
  "retrying in 1s" while the request is in flight.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- OpenCode Zen and Go providers (`opencode-zen`, `opencode-go`): set `OPENCODE_API_KEY`, choose a
  model, and hax selects the API it needs. `/usage` shows OpenCode Go's subscription limits. See
  [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md#opencode-zen-and-go).
- `/login` signs in to ChatGPT for the codex provider and keeps the token refreshed, so the codex
  CLI is no longer required. Existing codex CLI credentials remain a read-only fallback. See
  [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md#codex).
- llama.cpp multi-model router support: `/model` shows the server catalog and load state, selecting
  an idle model warms it in the background, and hax never loads a model you did not select.
- Custom gateways can route different models through their required APIs. Provider blocks also
  accept `extra_body` and `extra_headers` for documented gateway features such as routing rules,
  service tiers, and additional credentials. See
  [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md#custom-providers).
- The transcript records the provider, model, and reasoning effort used for each turn, plus a
  different model or OpenRouter endpoint reported by the response.
- FreeBSD and OpenBSD can now build from source, and Arch Linux users can install the `hax` AUR
  package. Stable releases update both the AUR package and Homebrew tap automatically.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** provider settings now belong to `providers.<id>` blocks and no longer leak between
  endpoints. Several keys and environment variables changed scope; users with advanced provider
  configuration should revisit [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md) and
  [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#provider-settings). llama.cpp settings now live under
  the dot-free `providers.llamacpp` config block; the user-facing `llama.cpp` selection remains
  accepted. Auto-selection tries the built-in providers before compatible and custom providers.
- `/model` now uses a version-aware order by default: model families stay together and newer
  versions appear first. Set `sort_models` to `off` to preserve server order.
- Only presets with a `description` are offered to the model as subagent roles. Favorite-only
  presets remain user shortcuts instead of inviting unrequested delegation based on a name alone.
- `/provider` shows human-readable display names while keeping the selectable id visible. Unknown
  or inapplicable provider settings now warn instead of being silently ignored, and `/config` keeps
  provider settings out of its general picker.
- Reasoning effort now applies to Anthropic-compatible models on custom gateways unless an explicit
  `thinking_mode` overrides it.
- Config updates made by hax preserve JSON numbers and booleans instead of rewriting them as
  strings.

### Fixed

- Interrupted and failed responses no longer carry unfinished reasoning into the next request. An
  interrupt before any answer text or tool call leaves the conversation unchanged, while a stream
  that ends unexpectedly is retried automatically from a clean attempt.
- Reasoning now continues correctly across turns for affected Kimi, GLM, DeepSeek, and MiniMax
  models on OpenCode, and OpenAI, Gemini, Kimi, and MiniMax models on OpenRouter.
- Completed tool calls whose arguments arrive all at once, including Grok on OpenCode Go, no longer
  run with empty arguments.
- Markdown headings, multi-part reasoning summaries, wrapped styling, and consecutive reasoning
  blocks render consistently in both the live and history views.
- Transcript, history, editor, and file-picker views preserve non-ASCII text and no longer expose
  terminal escape sequences when used with a plain pager or without a configured locale.
- HTTP traces redact credentials found in request and error bodies, including values loaded from
  environment variables for provider headers.
- Keyless custom providers with a configured URL are selectable even when they do not expose a
  model-list endpoint.
- Custom prompt caching defaults to the same 1h TTL as built-in providers; invalid `cache_ttl`
  values now warn and fall back safely.
- Release-tarball builds no longer pick up the version of an unrelated enclosing Git repository.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Installable via the `oleksandrchekhovskyi/hax` Homebrew tap. Each stable release points the
  formula at the published source tarball automatically.
- `make install` and `make symlink` complete the from-source flow. `scripts/install_deps.sh`
  now defaults to the full desktop set (build deps plus `fzf`), takes `ci` for the bare set, and
  supports Fedora/RHEL and openSUSE.
- `/session` shows the resolved context window before any request has reported usage
  (`? / 256k`), so the limit is visible up front.

### Changed

- The `task_kill` tool is merged into `task_wait`: a `kill` argument stops the background task
  and returns its final output in the same call — immediately, or after `timeout_seconds` to
  give the task a last window to finish on its own. Stopping a task and collecting its output
  no longer takes two model round trips.
- Compiled-in default model names are gone. Defaults now come only from live state (llama.cpp
  server discovery, or the model Codex mirrors from `~/.codex/config.toml`), so shipped
  binaries no longer park first-time users on a stale or expensive tier. Without a default,
  pick one with `/model` or `--model`.
- An unset `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` falls back to the first of `editor`/`nano`/`vim`/`vi` on
  `PATH`, and an unset `$PAGER` to `less -R` or `more`, instead of assuming `vi` and `less`.
  A configured value that does not resolve is reported as an error rather than failing at
  spawn.
- `--help` wraps at the terminal width the same way `/help` does, so it no longer overflows
  narrow terminals.

### Fixed

- `/new` and `/resume` now stop running background tasks and record each task's final state in
  the conversation being left, as quitting always did. Completed work no longer announces
  itself into a conversation that never started it, and task ids restart at `t1` with each
  fresh conversation.
- The parked "working..." spinner no longer blinks off and on around every silent tool call
  (reads, quiet bash). Erase, cluster text, and repark now land as one frame.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Releases now include fully static Linux binaries for x86_64 and aarch64 with a `SHA256SUMS`
  file. Each tarball contains the binary as `hax`, ready to extract into `PATH`; it runs on any
  distribution with no dependencies.
- The system TLS certificate store is located automatically (override with the standard
  `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`, or `SSL_CERT_DIR` environment variable), so HTTPS works
  even when the binary was built for a different distribution. Certificate errors on systems
  with no CA store now say how to fix them.

### Changed

- Unified diffs for write/edit results are computed by an in-tree diff implementation instead
  of shelling out to `diff`, so `diffutils` is no longer a runtime dependency and the write and
  edit tools work on minimal systems where `diff` is absent.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-07

Initial public release.
