# AgentBridge — Features

> **92 tools** across 12 categories — the most comprehensive AI agent integration for JetBrains IDEs.

AgentBridge connects ACP-compatible AI agents directly to IntelliJ's internal APIs.
Every file edit, refactoring, inspection, and git operation goes through IntelliJ's own engine — not
raw file I/O — so undo, formatting, indexing, and VCS all work correctly.

---

## Code Intelligence & Navigation

Deep integration with IntelliJ's code analysis engine — the agent can navigate your codebase the
same way you do.

- **`search_symbols`** — Search classes, methods, and fields by name using IntelliJ's symbol index
- **`search_text`** — Search text or regex patterns across all project files (reads from editor buffers, always
  up-to-date)
- **`find_references`** — Find all usages of any symbol across the project
- **`find_implementations`** — Find all implementations of a class/interface or overrides of a method
- **`get_call_hierarchy`** — Find all callers of a method with file paths and line numbers
- **`go_to_declaration`** — Jump to the declaration of a symbol
- **`get_file_outline`** — Get file structure — classes, methods, fields with line numbers
- **`get_class_outline`** — Get the full API of any class by fully qualified name (works on project, library, and JDK
  classes)
- **`get_type_hierarchy`** — Show supertypes and subtypes of any class or interface
- **`get_documentation`** — Retrieve Javadoc/KDoc for any symbol by fully qualified name
- **`download_sources`** — Download library source JARs for navigation and debugging
- **`list_project_files`** — List files with sorting, size filters, and date filters

---

## Code Quality & Inspections

Run the same inspections you see in the editor — plus Qodana and SonarQube — all from the chat.

- **`run_inspections`** — Run IntelliJ's full inspection engine on the project or a specific scope
- **`run_qodana`** — Run Qodana static analysis
- **`run_sonarqube_analysis`** — Run SonarQube for IDE analysis (requires SonarLint plugin)
- **`get_problems`** — Get cached errors and warnings for open files
- **`get_highlights`** — Get cached editor highlights (errors, warnings, info)
- **`get_compilation_errors`** — Fast compilation error check using cached daemon results
- **`apply_quickfix`** — Apply an IntelliJ quick-fix at a specific file and line
- **`suppress_inspection`** — Suppress an inspection finding with the appropriate annotation or comment
- **`optimize_imports`** — Remove unused imports and organize by code style
- **`format_code`** — Format a file using IntelliJ's configured code style
- **`add_to_dictionary`** — Add a word to the project spell-check dictionary

---

## File Operations

All file operations go through IntelliJ's Document API and Virtual File System — every edit is
undoable, auto-formatted, and instantly visible in the editor.

- **`read_file`** — Read file content from IntelliJ's editor buffer (always reflects unsaved changes)
- **`write_file`** — Write full file content or create a new file
- **`edit_text`** — Surgical find-and-replace within a file (exact string matching)
- **`create_file`** — Create a new file registered in IntelliJ's VFS
- **`delete_file`** — Delete a file from the project
- **`rename_file`** — Rename a file in place without moving it
- **`move_file`** — Move a file to a different directory
- **`reload_from_disk`** — Refresh IntelliJ's VFS to pick up external changes
- **`open_in_editor`** — Open a file in the editor, optionally at a specific line
- **`show_diff`** — Open IntelliJ's diff viewer to compare current content with proposed changes
- **`undo`** — Undo the last edit operation (each write + auto-format = 2 undo steps)
- **`redo`** — Redo previously undone edits

**Key behavior:** Built-in agent file edits are automatically intercepted and redirected
through `write_file` — so you always get proper undo, formatting, and no
"file changed externally" dialogs.

---

## Refactoring

Structural refactoring operations powered by IntelliJ's refactoring engine — safe renames that
update all references, extract method with proper scope analysis, and more.

- **`refactor`** — Perform rename, extract method, inline, or safe-delete operations

### Symbol-Level Editing

Edit code by symbol name instead of line numbers. The agent resolves symbols using IntelliJ's PSI,
so edits stay correct even when line numbers shift. Disambiguation by line hint when multiple symbols
share the same name.

- **`replace_symbol_body`** — Replace the entire definition of a method, class, or field by name
- **`insert_before_symbol`** — Insert content (methods, annotations, comments) before a symbol
- **`insert_after_symbol`** — Insert content (methods, fields, classes) after a symbol

---

## Testing & Coverage

Run tests, check results, and measure coverage — all without leaving the chat.

- **`list_tests`** — Discover tests by class, method, or file pattern
- **`run_tests`** — Run tests by class, method, or wildcard pattern via Gradle (with coverage)
- **`get_coverage`** — Retrieve code coverage results, optionally filtered by file or class

---

## Build & Project Management

Access project structure, trigger builds, and manage source roots.

- **`build_project`** — Trigger incremental compilation of the project or a specific module
- **`get_project_info`** — Get project name, SDK, modules, IDE version, and OS info
- **`get_indexing_status`** — Check if IntelliJ indexing is in progress (can block until finished)
- **`mark_directory`** — Mark a directory as source root, test root, resources, excluded, or generated
- **`edit_project_structure`** — Manage module dependencies, libraries, and SDKs

---

## Run Configurations

Create, edit, and execute IntelliJ run configurations from the chat — launch apps, run Gradle
tasks, or execute test suites.

- **`list_run_configurations`** — List all available run configurations
- **`run_configuration`** — Execute a run configuration by name

  match class name), Groovy (.groovy), and JavaScript (.js). TypeScript (.ts) needs Node 22.6+ or tsx. Python (.py)
  needs the Python plugin.
- **`list_themes`** / **`set_theme`** — List available IDE themes or switch themes
- **`get_chat_html`** — Retrieve the live DOM of the chat panel (for debugging)

## Chat & Workflow

The chat interface is a full-featured agent console built on JCEF (Chromium).

- **Streaming markdown** with syntax-highlighted code blocks
- **Context attachments** — attach files, selections, and symbols to prompts
- **Plan visualization** — tree view of agent steps with real-time progress indicators
- **Quick-reply buttons** for fast follow-up responses
- **Conversation history** maintained across IDE sessions
- **Export** — save conversations for reference
- **Sub-agent names** shown in chat bubble headers
- **Profile-specific coloring** for agent messages

### Nudge & Message Queue

Guide the agent mid-turn without interrupting its current task, or queue up tasks for later.

- **Enter** — while agent is running, sends a nudge (mid-turn guidance injected at the next tool
  call boundary); when idle, sends a normal prompt
- **Ctrl+Enter** — force-stops the current turn and immediately sends a new prompt
- **Ctrl+Shift+Enter** — sends the current prompt to a **message queue**. Queued messages are
  handled one by one automatically at the end of the current turn.
- **Unhandled nudge** — if the agent finishes its turn before consuming the nudge, it is
  automatically sent as a new prompt (no text lost)
- **Prompt placeholder** changes from _Ask \<agent\>…_ to _Nudge \<agent\>…_ while a turn is in
  progress

---

## Web Access (PWA)

Monitor and control the agent from any device on your local network — phone, tablet, or second
screen.

- **Installable PWA** — add to home screen on Android/iOS; launches fullscreen with the AgentBridge
  icon and splash screen
- **Live chat mirror** — all agent messages and tool chips stream in real time via SSE
- **Unified Send/Nudge button** — label switches to "Nudge" while the agent is running; sends a
  prompt when idle and nudges mid-turn
- **Quick-reply support** — `prompt_user` quick-reply buttons work from the web UI
- **Permission approvals** — approve or deny tool-use permission requests remotely
- **Push notifications** — browser notifications when the agent needs your attention (requires
  notification permission on the device)
- **Auto-reconnect** — reconnects automatically on network hiccup with full event replay so no
  messages are missed
- **Settings** — enable/disable and configure the port under
  _Settings → Tools → AgentBridge → Web Access_

---

## Cross-Client Session Restore

Switch between AI agents without losing your conversation. AgentBridge maintains a universal
session format that works across all supported clients — so your context travels with you.

- **Seamless agent switching** — switch from GitHub Copilot to Claude, OpenCode, Junie, Kiro, or Hermes Agent
  mid-project and pick up exactly where you left off
- **Full context preserved** — the restored agent sees your entire conversation history: messages,
  tool calls, code edits, and reasoning
- **No re-prompting needed** — just switch and continue; the agent already knows what you were
  working on
- **Works across subscriptions** — use your Copilot subscription for one task, your Claude credits
  for another, and switch back without starting over
- **Confirmed working** — Claude CLI ✅ · Junie ✅ · OpenCode ✅ · Kiro ✅ · Copilot (workaround) 🔧

---

## Multi-Agent Support

Connect any ACP-compatible agent and switch between profiles instantly.

- **Agent profiles** — Built-in profiles for every supported agent (Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, Junie, Kiro, OpenCode,
  Hermes Agent, Goose), plus fully custom profiles
- **Per-profile settings** — Connection command, tool permissions, built-in tool blocking, custom instructions
- **Agent selector** — Switch agents with one click from the connection panel
- **Extensible** — Add new agent backends by implementing `AgentConfig` + `AgentSettings` interfaces

---

## Permissions & Safety

Fine-grained control over what the agent can do.

- **Per-tool permissions** — Allow, Ask, or Deny for each of the 92 tools
- **Three-way prompts** — Deny / Allow / Allow for Session
- **Built-in edit interception** — Agent CLI file edits are redirected through IntelliJ's document API so every change
  is undoable
- **Diff Review for agent edits** — every file the agent writes shows up in the Review panel with persistent
  green/amber/red highlights; you can require manual approval, gate destructive git operations on pending review, and
  send structured revert nudges back to the agent. See the [Diff Review for Agent Edits](#diff-review-for-agent-edits)
  section below
- **Settings panel** — Enable/disable individual tools and configure permissions visually

---

## Diff Review for Agent Edits

Always-on safety net that turns every agent-originated file edit into a reviewable change.
See the full reference in [docs/INLINE-DIFF-REVIEW.md](docs/INLINE-DIFF-REVIEW.md).

- **Always-on tracking** — every agent edit shows up as a row, no setup required. There is
  no master "off" switch anymore; you choose between **manual approval** and **Auto-Approve**
- **Auto-Approve toggle** — when enabled, new edits land as **APPROVED** automatically and
  any existing pending rows are swept to APPROVED. Toggle it off to review every change
- **Persistent diff highlights** — green (added), amber (modified), red (deleted) bands
  appear in the gutter and editor, powered by the same `RangeHighlighter` layer used by VCS
- **Review tab** — side-panel list of every file with `+N / −N` line counts, status icon,
  and last-edited timestamp. Per-row Open / Accept / Revert; approved rows stay listed
  (visually muted) until cleaned. Press `Delete` on an approved row to remove it
- **Re-edit flips back to PENDING** — when Auto-Approve is off and the agent edits a file
  that was already approved, the row flips back to PENDING and only the *new* hunks
  remain highlighted (the snapshot is rebased onto the previously-approved content)
- **Cleanup paths** — per-row `Delete`, toolbar **Clean Approved**, post-`git_commit` prune
  (only files actually in the commit), branch-switch / reset-hard wipe, and an optional
  toolbar toggle **Auto-Clean on New Prompt**
- **Editor banner** — shows `Review: File 3/7 · 5 changes` with Show-diff, Accept,
  Previous, Next, and Revert… actions; navigation works across all pending files
- **Structured revert nudges** — reverting a file (from panel or banner) sends the agent a
  nudge containing the relative path, line ranges, optional reason, and a unified diff of
  the reverted hunks. When a git gate is currently blocking, the revert dialog offers
  **Continue reviewing** (queues the nudge, keeps gating) or **Send to agent now**
  (short-circuits the gate immediately so the agent can re-plan)
- **Git gating** — `git_commit`, `git_merge`, `git_rebase`, `git_pull`, `git_reset --hard`,
  `git_stash pop/apply`, `git_branch create/switch`, `git_cherry_pick`, and `git_revert`
  block (up to 10 minutes) until **pending** items are resolved. Approved rows are no-ops
  for the gate
- **Agent-only tracking** — a thread-local marker ensures user typing, manual reformats,
  and external edits are *not* captured; only edits made from inside tool calls become
  review items
- **Worktree-safe** — snapshots are invalidated automatically on branch switch,
  `reset --hard`, rebase, and similar operations so stale baselines never linger
- **Persistence** — the review list (snapshots, approval state, timestamps, line counts) is
  stored in the workspace file and survives IDE restarts
- **Unhandled-nudge handling** — `Settings → Tools → AgentBridge → Chat input` lets you
  choose whether unhandled nudges are *Auto-sent as a new prompt* (default) or
  *Restored into the chat input* (prepended to whatever you were typing)

---

## MCP Tool Hooks

Intercept any MCP tool call with shell scripts that run at four lifecycle points.
Hooks create a closed feedback loop: they receive JSON on stdin and write JSON to stdout,
and the MCP server uses the response to shape what the agent perceives.

See [docs/MCP-TOOL-HOOKS.md](docs/MCP-TOOL-HOOKS.md) for the complete reference.

- **Permission hooks** — gate tool execution with allow/deny decisions
- **Pre hooks** — modify tool arguments before execution, or block with an error
- **Success hooks** — transform output, append tips, or flag results as errors
- **Failure hooks** — augment error messages, suggest fixes, or resolve errors to success
- **State override** — success and failure hooks can flip the error state via `"state": "success"` / `"error"`
- **Hook chaining** — multiple entries per trigger run sequentially, each seeing the previous output
- **Identity enforcement** — built-in hook scripts prevent agents from impersonating the repository
  owner when creating commits, PRs, issues, and comments. Uses the connected agent's name
  (from MCP `initialize` handshake) for attribution
- **Connected agent identity** — `AGENTBRIDGE_AGENT_NAME` env var injected into every hook script,
  extracted from the MCP `clientInfo.name` field
- **Per-tool configuration** — one JSON file per tool in `<storage-dir>/hooks/<tool-id>.json`
- **Async mode** — fire-and-forget hooks for notifications and logging
- **Configurable timeout, failSilently, and env vars** per hook entry
- **Static text modifiers** — `prependString` / `appendString` fields for simple text prepend/append without scripts
- **Hot-reload** — hook configs are automatically reloaded within 2 seconds, no IDE restart needed
- **Settings UI** — configure hooks per tool via the Settings dialog (🪝 indicator on hooked tools)
- **Built-in defaults** — generic safety hooks (command abuse detection, terminal guardrails,
  naming checks) provisioned on first project open; **Restore Default Hooks** button in settings
  resets to bundled originals
- **Side panel indicator** — 🪝 icon on tool calls with active hooks in the Tool Calls panel

---

## Model Selection & Billing

Choose the right model for the task and track usage in real time.

- **Real-time billing graph** — Live cost estimates and monthly cycle tracking for Copilot
- **Usage multipliers** — See per-model cost multipliers before selecting
- **One-click model switching** — Change models mid-conversation

---

## Requirements
