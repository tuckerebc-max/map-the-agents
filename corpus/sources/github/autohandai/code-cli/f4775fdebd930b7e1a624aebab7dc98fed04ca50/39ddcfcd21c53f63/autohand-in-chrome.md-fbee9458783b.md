# Autohand in Chrome

Autohand in Chrome connects your CLI coding agent to a Chrome extension, giving it the ability to navigate pages, fill forms, capture screenshots, read network traffic, and debug — all from your terminal.

## How It Works

```
CLI (autohand)
  ├── /browser command creates a handoff token
  ├── Opens Chrome with the Autohand side panel
  └── Communicates via native messaging (JSON-RPC 2.0)
        │
        ▼
Chrome Extension (side panel)
  ├── Receives instructions from CLI
  ├── Executes browser tools on the active tab
  └── Returns results back to CLI
```

The CLI and extension communicate through Chrome's native messaging protocol. A generated Node.js bridge process (`~/.autohand/chrome/native-host/host.js`) translates between Chrome's length-prefixed framing and the CLI's line-based JSON-RPC.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Extension

Install the Autohand Chrome extension from the Chrome Web Store or load it unpacked from your local build.

### 2. Connect from the CLI

```bash
# Start autohand
autohand

# In the REPL, run:
/browser
```

Select **Open in Chrome** from the menu. This will:
- Install the native messaging host (if not already installed)
- Create a handoff token for the current session
- Open Chrome with the Autohand side panel

### 3. Use the Side Panel

Press **Cmd+E** (macOS) or **Ctrl+E** (Windows/Linux) to toggle the side panel. The extension will automatically attach to your CLI session.

## CLI Flags

```bash
autohand --browser          # Start with browser bridge enabled
autohand --no-browser       # Start with browser bridge disabled
```

## Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/browser` | Open the browser integration panel with connection status |
| `/browser disconnect` | Close the browser bridge and disable it |

## `/browser` Panel

When you run `/browser`, you see a panel with:

- **Connection**: `Connected` (green), `Disconnected` (yellow), or `Not installed` (red)
- **Status**: Whether the native host is installed
- **Extension**: Whether the extension profile was detected

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Open in Chrome** | Create a handoff and launch Chrome |
| **Manage permissions** | Open extension settings |
| **Reconnect extension** | Reinstall the native messaging host |
| **Enabled by default** | Toggle whether the bridge starts automatically with the CLI |

## Browser Tools

When connected, the agent gains access to these browser tools:

### Navigation & Interaction

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `browser_navigate` | Navigate to a URL |
| `browser_click` | Click an element by CSS selector |
| `browser_type` | Type text into an input element |
| `browser_press_key` | Send a keyboard event (Enter, Escape, etc.) |
| `browser_scroll` | Scroll the page or to a specific element |

### Reading & Inspection

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `browser_get_page_context` | Get page title, URL, headings, metadata, and body text |
| `browser_get_element` | Get computed styles, rect, and attributes of an element |
| `browser_find_element` | Find elements by selector, text content, or ARIA role |
| `browser_wait_for_element` | Wait for an element to appear (5s timeout) |
| `browser_screenshot` | Capture the current page; use `save: true` to download a PNG |
| `browser_take_full_page_screenshot` | Capture the full page; use `save: true` to download a PNG |

### Debugging

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `browser_read_console` | Read captured console messages (errors, warnings, info) |
| `browser_read_network` | Read captured network requests with filtering by URL, method, status |
| `browser_get_tabs` | List all open browser tabs |
| `browser_get_tab_groups` | List tab groups with their member tabs |

### Tool Examples

```
> Read the console errors on this page
  → agent calls browser_read_console with level: "error"

> What network requests are failing?
  → agent calls browser_read_network with status: "4"

> Fill in the login form with test@example.com
  → agent calls browser_type with selector: "#email", text: "test@example.com"

> Take a screenshot of the current page
  → agent calls browser_screenshot
```

## Experimental reliable browser tools V2

Browser tools V2 are opt-in and disabled by default. Enable the experiment, then
restart the CLI:

```bash
autohand experiments enable experimental_browser_tools_v2
```

The equivalent config is:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "experimentalBrowserToolsV2": true
  }
}
```

V2 is exposed only after the restarted CLI and extension negotiate protocol
version 2 through `autohand.browserCapabilities.set`. A new CLI paired with an
older extension, or an older CLI paired with a new extension, continues to use
the legacy browser tools.

Use this flow for reliable targeting:

1. Call `browser_snapshot` and select the opaque `ref` for the intended element.
2. Act with that ref, or use a CSS selector or role/name locator only as a compatibility fallback.
3. Use `browser_wait_for` with an element, text, value, URL, load, or network-idle condition. Waits default to 10 seconds and are capped at 25 seconds.
4. If a ref is reported as stale or ambiguous, take a new snapshot. Refs are scoped to one tab, frame, document, and browser session; never retry an old ref after navigation.

For forms, use `browser_inspect_form` → `browser_fill_form` →
`browser_validate_form` → `browser_submit_form`. Filling is sequential and never
submits. Submission validates first, calls `requestSubmit` once, and can accept a
typed post-submit wait. Do not retry a submission whose outcome is ambiguous.
`browser_reset_form`, file upload, form submission, and dialog handling retain
the normal interactive approval flow; YOLO and Automode keep their existing
approval behavior.

Passwords, one-time codes, payment fields, API keys, and secret-like values are
redacted from browser results and tool events. Upload paths are resolved locally
by the CLI and results expose basenames only. V2 does not add credential
storage, payment autofill, CAPTCHA bypass, arbitrary JavaScript execution,
arbitrary sleeps, blind retries, or unrestricted browser URL fetching to the
default Chrome policy.

## Configuration

Add to `~/.autohand/config.json`:

```json
{
  "chrome": {
    "extensionId": "your-extension-id",
    "enabledByDefault": false,
    "browser": "auto",
    "userDataDir": "/path/to/chrome/user-data",
    "profileDirectory": "Default"
  }
}
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `extensionId` | `string` | — | Chrome extension ID for direct handoff |
| `enabledByDefault` | `boolean` | `false` | Auto-start browser bridge with CLI |
| `browser` | `string` | `"auto"` | Preferred browser: `auto`, `chrome`, `chromium`, `brave`, `edge` |
| `userDataDir` | `string` | — | Browser user data directory |
| `profileDirectory` | `string` | — | Profile directory name (e.g., `"Default"`) |
| `installUrl` | `string` | — | Fallback URL when extension ID is not set |

## Connection Lifecycle

### Connecting

1. User runs `/browser` → selects **Open in Chrome**
2. CLI creates a handoff token in `~/.autohand/chrome/handoffs/`
3. Chrome opens, extension attaches to the session via the token
4. Native messaging bridge forwards JSON-RPC between CLI and extension

### Disconnecting

The connection can be closed from either side:

**From CLI:**
```
/browser disconnect
```

**From extension:**
Click the disconnect button in the side panel. Closing the panel only detaches
the UI; the background bridge keeps an in-flight browser tool connected until
it finishes or the CLI/browser session ends.

### Reconnecting

If the connection drops (CLI crash, browser restart, etc.):

1. The extension shows a **Connection lost** banner with the reason
2. Auto-reconnect attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s... up to 15s, max 10 attempts)
3. Manual retry via the banner's retry button or the header reconnect icon
4. Re-focusing the side panel also triggers a reconnect attempt

**From CLI:** Run `/browser` again and select **Open in Chrome** to create a new handoff.

### Heartbeat

The extension sends a health check every 30 seconds. If the CLI doesn't respond within 10 seconds, the connection is marked as lost and auto-reconnect begins.

## Architecture

```
Chrome Extension                          CLI Process
┌──────────────┐                    ┌──────────────────┐
│  Side Panel  │◄──── Chrome ─────►│  Native Host      │
│  (UI + RPC)  │      Native       │  (host.js)        │
│              │      Messaging    │       │            │
│  Content     │      (4-byte LE   │       ▼            │
│  Script      │       + JSON)     │  autohand          │
│  (DOM tools) │                   │  --mode rpc        │
└──────────────┘                    │  (JSON-RPC 2.0)   │
                                    └──────────────────┘
```

- **Side Panel**: Main UI, sends prompts and receives responses
- **Content Script**: Runs on every page, executes DOM tools (click, type, find, etc.)
- **Background Worker**: Routes messages, handles context menus and shortcuts
- **Native Host**: Node.js bridge that translates Chrome native messaging to stdio
- **CLI RPC Mode**: The agent running in JSON-RPC server mode

## Permissions

Browser tool permissions follow the CLI's permission mode:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Interactive** | Agent asks before each browser action |
| **Full-auto** | Agent acts without asking |
| **Restricted** | Agent denies dangerous operations |

Site-level permissions are inherited from the Chrome extension's host permissions.

## Troubleshooting

### "Not installed" status

The native messaging host is not installed. Run `/browser` and select **Reconnect extension**, or:

```bash
autohand --browser
```

### "Disconnected" status

The CLI is running but no active handoff exists. Run `/browser` → **Open in Chrome** to create one.

### Extension can't find the CLI

Make sure `autohand` is in your PATH, or set `cliPath` in the extension settings to the full path of the binary.

### Port conflicts

The OAuth callback server uses port 1455. If another process is using it:

```bash
lsof -i :1455
kill <PID>
```
