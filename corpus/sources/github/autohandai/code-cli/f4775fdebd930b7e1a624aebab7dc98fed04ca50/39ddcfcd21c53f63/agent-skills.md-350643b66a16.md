## Overview

Skills work like on-demand `AGENTS.md` files that can be activated for specific tasks. Each skill contains:

- **Purpose statement** - What the skill does
- **Usage examples** - Concrete prompts showing how to use it
- **Workflow steps** - Actionable procedures for the agent
- **Tool permissions** - Which tools the skill can use

When activated, skills inject their instructions into the agent's context, providing specialized guidance for the task at hand.

---

## Quick Start

### List Available Skills

```bash
# In Autohand REPL
/skills
```

### Use a Skill

```bash
/skills use changelog-generator
```

An exact `$skill-name` mention activates the installed skill and injects its instructions into the same turn:

```text
$extension-builder adapt this Pi package into an Autohand extension and install it for this project
```

`extension-builder` ships with Autohand. The curated copy can also be installed through Autohand's community installer or the open skills ecosystem:

```bash
autohand --skill-install extension-builder --yes
npx skills add https://github.com/autohandai/community-skills --skill extension-builder -a autohand-code -y
```

### Create a New Skill

```bash
/skills new
```

### Auto-Install Recommended Project Skills

```bash
autohand --auto-skill
```

### Built-In Deep Research

```bash
/deep-research Hermes self evolving and DSPy
```

`/deep-research <topic>` activates the bundled `deep-research` skill, uses Autohand's web search, fetch, task, and file tools, and saves a cited markdown report under `<project>/.autohand/research/topic-<slug>.md`. `/deep-search` is an alias. Saved reports are surfaced in later prompts so the next turn can reuse the research context.

While research is running, `/deep-research status` (or `/deep-search status`) shows the persisted run state, task progress, current tool, evidence and failure counts, report target, tokens, and remaining context. A run is only marked completed after all recorded research tasks finish, the cited report passes its required-section/source audit, the final response confirms the exact saved path, and any project quality checks pass. Otherwise the run remains incomplete with explicit blockers in its status.

## Skill Discovery

### Account skills from Console

All plans can add skills from Skilled, create or import their own SKILL.md instructions,
edit them, enable or disable them, and remove them in Console under Configure > Skills.
Account-managed instructions synchronize automatically at startup and during the normal
background sync interval (5 minutes by default), when Code is signed in and sync is enabled.
Use the same `api.accountId` as Console when working with a team account.

The account copy lives in a separate `.account-skills/` cache. A running registry rechecks
that snapshot when listing or activating skills, so disabled or removed account skills are
no longer available after sync without restarting Code. Independently installed and project
skills are preserved. An account skill with the same name takes precedence while it is
present in the account library, including when disabled. Logout or switching the configured
account hides the previous account cache. Offline use keeps the last successfully synced
snapshot until connectivity returns.

Console's Skills Usage page shows reported CLI skill events. Telemetry is optional and is
not required for managing or synchronizing skills. Console only marks a revision applied
after the CLI has persisted it and acknowledged it. The API skill-library migration and
a CLI version containing account-skill sync must be released before this works in production.

Skills are discovered from multiple locations, with later sources taking precedence:

| Location | Source ID | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Packaged `dist/skills/builtin/**/SKILL.md` | `builtin` | Skills shipped with Autohand |
| `~/.codex/skills/**/SKILL.md` | `codex-user` | User-level Codex skills (recursive) |
| `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | `claude-user` | User-level Claude skills (one level) |
| `~/.agent/skills/**/SKILL.md` | `agent-user` | User-level shared agent skills (recursive) |
| `~/.agents/skills/**/SKILL.md` | `agent-user` | User-level `npx skills` shared skills (recursive) |
| `~/.autohand/skills/**/SKILL.md` | `autohand-user` | User-level Autohand skills (recursive) |
| `<project>/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | `claude-project` | Project-level Claude skills (one level) |
| `<project>/skills/**/SKILL.md` | `agent-project` | Project-level shared skills (recursive) |
| `<project>/.agent/skills/**/SKILL.md` | `agent-project` | Project-level shared agent skills (recursive) |
| `<project>/.agents/skills/**/SKILL.md` | `agent-project` | Project-level shared agent skills (recursive) |
| `<project>/<agent-dir>/skills/**/SKILL.md` | `agent-project` | Third-party agent project skills (recursive) |
| `<project>/.autohand/skills/**/SKILL.md` | `autohand-project` | Project-level Autohand skills (recursive) |
| Enabled extension `contributes.skills` entries | `extension` | Skills owned by installed Autohand extensions |

Supported third-party project skill directories include `.aider-desk/skills`, `.augment/skills`, `.bob/skills`, `.codeartsdoer/skills`, `.codebuddy/skills`, `.codemaker/skills`, `.codestudio/skills`, `.commandcode/skills`, `.continue/skills`, `.cortex/skills`, `.crush/skills`, `.devin/skills`, `.factory/skills`, `.forge/skills`, `.goose/skills`, `.hermes/skills`, `.junie/skills`, `.iflow/skills`, `.kilocode/skills`, `.kiro/skills`, `.kode/skills`, `.mcpjam/skills`, `.vibe/skills`, `.mux/skills`, `.openhands/skills`, `.pi/skills`, `.qoder/skills`, `.qwen/skills`, `.rovodev/skills`, `.roo/skills`, `.tabnine/agent/skills`, `.trae/skills`, `.windsurf/skills`, `.zencoder/skills`, `.neovate/skills`, `.pochi/skills`, and `.adal/skills`.

### Auto-Copy Behavior

Skills discovered from Codex or Claude locations are automatically copied to the corresponding Autohand location:

- `~/.codex/skills/` and `~/.claude/skills/` → `~/.autohand/skills/`
- `<project>/.claude/skills/` → `<project>/.autohand/skills/`

Existing skills in Autohand locations are never overwritten.
Shared agent and third-party project skill directories are loaded in place; they are not automatically copied.

### Codex Skill Compatibility

Autohand can activate skills discovered from `~/.codex/skills/`. When those skills include Codex-specific installer instructions, Autohand treats user-skill installs as Autohand installs by default:

- child shell commands launched by Autohand map `CODEX_HOME` to `AUTOHAND_HOME` unless the command explicitly overrides `CODEX_HOME`
- skill installs should target `$AUTOHAND_HOME/skills` (default `~/.autohand/skills`), not `~/.codex/skills`
- "Restart Codex" follow-up text in imported installer skills means restart Autohand

---

## SKILL.md Format

Skills use YAML frontmatter followed by markdown content:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: Brief description of the skill (max 1024 chars)
license: MIT
compatibility: Works with Node.js 18+
allowed-tools: read_file write_file run_command git_status
metadata:
  author: your-name
  version: "1.0.0"
---

# My Skill

Detailed instructions for the AI agent...
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Max Length | Description |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | 64 chars | Lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens only |
| `description` | Yes | 1024 chars | Brief description of when to use this skill |
| `license` | No | - | License identifier (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0) |
| `compatibility` | No | 500 chars | Compatibility notes |
| `allowed-tools` | No | - | Space-delimited list of allowed tools |
| `metadata` | No | - | Additional key-value metadata |

---

## Auto-Skill Bootstrap

The `--auto-skill` flag analyzes your project, finds high-confidence community skills that fit the codebase, installs them into `<project>/.autohand/skills/`, and activates them for the session before the agent starts.

### Usage

```bash
autohand --auto-skill
```

### How It Works

1. **Project Analysis** - Scans for package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, go.mod
2. **Recommendation** - Uses the skills advisor to rank community skills for the project
3. **Install** - Automatically installs the strongest matches at project scope
4. **Activation** - Activates the installed skills so their instructions are available immediately
5. **Fallback** - If nothing scores highly enough, Autohand continues normally without installing skills

### Detected Patterns

| Category | Detected Items |
|----------|----------------|
| **Languages** | TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go |
| **Frameworks** | React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Express, Fastify, NestJS, Flask, Django, FastAPI |
| **Patterns** | CLI tools, testing, monorepo, Docker, CI/CD, bundling, linting, database, API |
| **Package Managers** | npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, pip, cargo, go |
| **Environment** | Git repository, test framework, CI/CD pipelines |

### Example Output

```
$ autohand --auto-skill
Scanning for community skills that fit this project...
Project: Ink TypeScript CLI with strong testing needs.
  ✓ clean-coder-skill (92%) — Improves implementation discipline for CLI refactors.

## Available Tools

Skills can specify which tools they need via the `allowed-tools` field. Available tools by category:

### File Operations

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `read_file` | Read file contents |
| `write_file` | Write/create files |
| `append_file` | Append to existing files |
| `apply_patch` | Apply unified diff patches |
| `find` | Canonical code discovery tool for exact, contextual, and semantic search |
| `search` | Legacy alias for `find` exact search |

| `create_directory` | Create directories |
| `delete_path` | Delete files/directories |
| `rename_path` | Rename/move files |
| `copy_path` | Copy files/directories |

### Git Operations

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `git_status` | Show working tree status |
| `git_diff` | Show uncommitted changes |
| `git_diff_range` | Show diff between commits |
| `git_log` | View commit history |
| `git_add` | Stage files |
| `git_commit` | Create commits |
| `git_branch` | List/create branches |
| `git_switch` | Switch branches |
| `git_stash` | Stash changes |
| `git_stash_list` | List stashes |
| `git_stash_pop` | Apply stashed changes |
| `git_merge` | Merge branches |
| `git_rebase` | Rebase branches |
| `git_cherry_pick` | Cherry-pick commits |
| `git_fetch` | Fetch from remote |
| `git_pull` | Pull changes |
| `git_push` | Push changes |

### Commands

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `run_command` | Execute shell commands |
| `custom_command` | Run user-defined commands |

### Dependencies

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `add_dependency` | Add project dependency |
| `remove_dependency` | Remove dependency |

### Memory

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `save_memory` | Persist information |
| `recall_memory` | Retrieve information ranked by content, tags, and recency |
| `inspect_memory` | Outline or zoom memory, invalidate derived summaries, or rebuild projections |
| `delete_memory` | Delete an obsolete memory while retaining its canonical deletion event |

Delegated and teammate workers read up to five recent project lessons from the
selected workspace's `.autohand/memory/`, with each lesson truncated to 1,000
characters. They treat saved lessons as reference data, not new instructions or
permission to expand a task. Bare mode disables this automatic context.

Workers with `save_memory` available can save an explicitly authorized,
evidence-backed lesson with `level="project"`. They must not save secrets, raw
logs, or speculative explanations. Read-only workers and workers without the
memory tool report lesson candidates to the lead; their tool access is never
expanded to persist memory. Worker output is not automatically stored, and
`agent.autoMemory: false` keeps automatic lesson saving disabled.

Skill activations are learned as project capability usage in the canonical
memory event log. The derived project ranking distinguishes user and agent use,
so frequently successful skills can inform later sessions without copying skill
bodies into memory. Slash-command usage follows the same privacy-safe model,
but commands are only suggested and never automatically executed.

### Planning

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `plan` | Create action plans |
| `todo_write` | Manage todo lists |

```

### Example 2: TypeScript Refactoring Guide

```markdown
---
name: typescript-refactoring
description: Guides TypeScript refactoring with type-safe patterns and best practices.
allowed-tools: read_file write_file find apply_patch run_command
---

# TypeScript Refactoring Guide

Provides patterns and step-by-step guidance for safe TypeScript refactoring.

## When to Use This Skill

- Extracting reusable functions or components
- Converting JavaScript to TypeScript
- Improving type safety
- Reducing code duplication
- Modernizing legacy patterns

## How to Use

```
Refactor this function to use generics
```

```
Extract the user validation logic into a separate module
```

```
Convert this file to strict TypeScript
```

## Workflow

1. **Analyze Current Code**
   - Read the file(s) to understand existing patterns
   - Identify type issues with `tsc --noEmit`

2. **Plan Changes**
   - List all files that need modification
   - Identify breaking changes to exports
   - Consider backward compatibility

3. **Make Changes**
   - Apply changes incrementally
   - Run type checker after each change
   - Update imports in dependent files

4. **Verify**
   - Run `tsc --noEmit` to check types
   - Run tests to confirm behavior unchanged
   - Review generated diffs

## Common Patterns

### Extract Function
```typescript
// Before
const result = items.filter(x => x.active).map(x => x.name);

// After
function getActiveNames<T extends { active: boolean; name: string }>(items: T[]): string[] {
  return items.filter(x => x.active).map(x => x.name);
}
```

### Add Type Guards
```typescript
function isUser(value: unknown): value is User {
  return typeof value === 'object' && value !== null && 'id' in value;
}
```

## Tips

- Enable `strict` mode in tsconfig for best type safety
- Use `unknown` instead of `any` when type is truly unknown
- Prefer interfaces for object shapes, types for unions
- Add JSDoc comments for complex types
```
