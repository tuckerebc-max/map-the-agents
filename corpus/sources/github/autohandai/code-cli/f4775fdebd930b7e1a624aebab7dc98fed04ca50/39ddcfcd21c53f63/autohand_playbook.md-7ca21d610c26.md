```

### Generate an API Endpoint

```bash
› Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication with login, register, and refresh token routes. Use Express and JWT. @src/routes/auth.ts
```

### Generate from Specification

```bash
› Based on @api-spec.yaml, generate TypeScript types and API client functions for all endpoints.
```

### Pro Tips

- Reference existing files with `@` to maintain consistency
- Be specific about patterns: "Use the factory pattern" or "Follow existing component structure"
- Ask for edge case handling: "Include error boundaries and loading states"

---

## 3. Bug Fixing

**Goal:** Identify and fix bugs in your codebase.

### Fix a Specific Error

```bash
› I'm getting "TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined" in @src/components/UserList.tsx. Find and fix the bug.
```

### Fix Failing Tests

```bash
› The tests in @tests/auth.test.ts are failing. Analyze the test output and fix the issues in the source code.
```

### Debug Runtime Issues

```bash
› Users report that the form in @src/pages/Checkout.tsx submits twice. Find the cause and fix it.
```

### Pro Tips

- Include error messages and stack traces in your prompt
- Reference both the failing code and related files
- Ask for root cause analysis: "Explain why this bug occurred and how to prevent similar issues"

---

## 4. Refactoring
