A multi-provider AI coding agent with the persona of a Tech-Priest

</div>

---

Binharic is a terminal-based AI coding assistant (a coding agent) similar to OpenAI's Codex, Google's Gemini CLI, and
Anthropic's Claude Code—but with the personality of a devout Tech-Priest of the Adeptus Mechanicus.
Binharic is written in TypeScript and uses the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) framework for most of its underlying
agentic logic (like tool calling and workflow management).
Additionally, its architecture follows the recommendations mentioned in the
[building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) article from Anthropic,
to a good degree.

Binharic's development started as a personal project to learn more about building a terminal-based coding agent.
However, the project has grown somewhat into a full-fledged coding assistant with a lot of features
like the ability to analyze projects, run tests, find bugs, and perform code review.

### Features

- Can use models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and Ollama
- Is fully customizable and extendable (system prompt and adding new tools)
- Comes with a built-in keyword-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline
- Comes with a large set of built-in tools (like for reading files and running Bash commands)
- Can use external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Comes with predefined workflows for common software development tasks (like debugging and code review)

See the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the list of implemented and planned features.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Binharic is in early development, so bugs and breaking changes are expected.
> Please use the [issues page](https://github.com/CogitatorTech/infera/issues) to report bugs or request features.

### Getting Started

You can follow the instructions below to install and use Binharic in your terminal.

#### Installation

```sh
npm install -g @cogitator/binharic-cli
```

#### Running in the Terminal

```sh
# Make sure API keys are available in the environment
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-anthropic-api-key>
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-google-api-key>

# Start Binharic in the terminal
binharic
```

> [!NOTE]
> The performance of a coding agent like Binharic, to a great extent, depends on the model it uses.
> So, it's recommended to use state-of-the-art models (like Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) for the best
> results.

#### Running in a Container

Alternatively, you can run Binharic in a container:

```sh
# API keys should be available in the environment already
docker run -it --rm \
  -v ${PWD}:/workspace \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY \
  -e GOOGLE_API_KEY \
  ghcr.io/cogitatortech/binharic-cli:<version>
```

`<version>` should be replaced with the version of the Binharic (like `0.1.0-alpha.6`) or `latest`.
Use `latest` if you want to use the latest (development) version of Binharic.

#### Configuration

You can configure Binharic by editing the `~/.config/binharic/config.json5` file.
Additionally, Binharic supports environment variables for configuration.
See the [docs](docs) (TO BE ADDED) for more information.
