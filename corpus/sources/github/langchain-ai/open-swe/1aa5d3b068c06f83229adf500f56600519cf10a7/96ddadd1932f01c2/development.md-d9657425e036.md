# Local Development

Run Open SWE on your machine: the backend and the dashboard on `http://localhost:2024`, with GitHub and Slack webhooks arriving through a tunnel. Deploying it for a team is the [installation guide](INSTALLATION.md).

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.14+** and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [LangGraph CLI](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/cli) (installed by `uv sync`)
- Node 22.22.2+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for the dashboard
- A free [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account, so GitHub and Slack can reach your local backend (step 3)
- A Slack workspace where you may create apps, and a GitHub account or organization where you may create a GitHub App

## 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-swe.git
cd open-swe
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync --all-extras
```

## 2. Create a GitHub App for your machine

Follow [Create a GitHub App](INSTALLATION.md#3-create-a-github-app) in the installation guide with these values, and install it on the repositories you want to test against:

- **Callback URL**: `http://localhost:2024/dashboard/api/auth/callback`. This is where GitHub sends the browser after "Sign in with GitHub" on your local dashboard.
- **Webhook URL**: `https://<name>.ngrok-free.dev/webhooks/github` with your ngrok domain from step 3, or leave the webhook off (untick **Active**) if you only start runs from the dashboard. GitHub cannot deliver to `localhost`.

Use a name of your own (GitHub App names are unique), and give it a distinct mention handle (`OPEN_SWE_MENTION_TAGS`) if a shared deployment already answers to `@openswe` in the same repositories.

## 3. Tunnel for webhooks

Always run an ngrok tunnel when starting Open SWE locally. GitHub and Slack need a public HTTPS hostname that stays the same across restarts. Reuse an existing tunnel and its exact configured domain, forwarding to the active backend (normally localhost:2024). If no tunnel is running, recover the domain from configuration or prior local runtime notes in the primary checkout before starting one; an automatically assigned hostname will not match existing webhook settings.

For a first-time setup, the free ngrok plan gives you a static domain:

1. Sign up at [dashboard.ngrok.com](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) and install the agent (`brew install ngrok`, or the download the dashboard offers).
2. Connect the agent to your account with the `ngrok config add-authtoken …` command shown under **Getting Started → Your Authtoken**.
3. Under **Domains**, claim the free static domain. It looks like `<name>.ngrok-free.dev`.
4. Start the tunnel and leave it running while you develop:

   ```bash
   make tunnel NGROK_DOMAIN=<name>.ngrok-free.dev   # or export NGROK_DOMAIN once in your shell
   ```

`make tunnel` runs `ngrok http 2024` on that domain with [`examples/ngrok/webhooks-only.yml`](../examples/ngrok/webhooks-only.yml) as its traffic policy, so only `/webhooks/*` is reachable from the internet. That restriction is not optional. Under `langgraph dev` the LangGraph API itself (`/threads`, `/runs`, `/assistants`, `/store`, …) has no authentication at all: the dashboard API checks its session cookie and the webhook endpoints check their signatures, but anyone who can reach port 2024 can read and create threads and runs. A tunnel that forwards the whole port publishes exactly that. Everything except the webhooks stays on `http://localhost:2024`, where you keep opening the dashboard. Check the policy once the backend is up (step 6): `curl https://<name>.ngrok-free.dev/webhooks/slack` answers `{"status":"ok", …}` from the backend, while `/ok` gets ngrok's own 404.

Preserve the existing webhook traffic policy. For local Slack OAuth, also preserve the callback relay: requests to `/dashboard/api/slack/callback` on the ngrok domain must redirect to `http://localhost:2024/dashboard/api/slack/callback` with the complete query string intact. The stock webhooks-only policy blocks this path, so reuse the local policy containing that redirect when Slack OAuth is configured. The callback is a redirect to localhost; dashboard pages and API routes must remain inaccessible through the tunnel.

## 4. Create a Slack app for your machine

Slack delivers events to one URL per app, so a local backend needs its own Slack app rather than the one a shared deployment uses. Follow [Create the Slack app](INSTALLATION.md#5-create-the-slack-app) in the installation guide with your ngrok domain from step 3, `<name>.ngrok-free.dev`, as `<your-url>` (the manifest supplies the `https://`), and give it a name that says it is yours, for example `open-swe-<you>`; the bot's handle follows from it. Copy the four values it lists into `.env` in the next step.

Slack checks the events Request URL against a running backend. If you create the app before `make dev` is up, open **Event Subscriptions** afterwards and press **Retry**. The same applies whenever you change `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`: restart the backend, then Retry.

## 5. Write `.env`

Create `.env` in the repository root; `langgraph dev` loads it.

```bash
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=""            # LangSmith → Settings → API Keys; also used for sandboxes and trace links
LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"        # trace runs to LangSmith
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=""            # optional project for traces and "View trace" links; default "default"

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""            # any provider key, or LANGSMITH_GATEWAY_API_KEY for the LLM Gateway; see the installation guide

GITHUB_APP_ID=""                # step 2
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID=""
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=""
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"   # one double-quoted line, \n between the PEM lines
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=""
GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID=""
ALLOWED_GITHUB_USERS=""         # your GitHub login; required unless ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS is set

SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=""              # step 4: OAuth & Permissions → Bot User OAuth Token (xoxb-...)
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=""         # Basic Information → App Credentials
SLACK_BOT_USER_ID=""            # the bot's member id (bot profile → ⋮ → Copy member ID)
SLACK_BOT_USERNAME=""           # the bot's handle, e.g. open_swe_you
SLACK_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="https://<name>.ngrok-free.dev"  # your existing domain from step 3; used by Slack OAuth and the admin manifest

TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=""         # openssl rand -base64 32  (encrypts stored GitHub and Slack tokens)
DASHBOARD_JWT_SECRET=""         # openssl rand -hex 32     (signs the session cookie and OAuth state)
CONFIGURED_ADMINS=""            # your GitHub login or email; admins see the Admin pages
```

`LANGGRAPH_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:2024`, and `DASHBOARD_BASE_URL` / `DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL` default to it, so none of the three is needed locally. Keep them on localhost when setting `SLACK_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the tunnel. Provider keys, the LLM Gateway, and how the running model is chosen are in [Model providers and API keys](INSTALLATION.md#4-model-providers-and-api-keys). Linear, if you use it, comes from the [Linear](INSTALLATION.md#linear) section of the installation guide, with your ngrok domain as the URL.

## 6. Run

Check existing processes and ports before starting. When switching worktrees, stop the previous backend gracefully and wait for it to release port 2024 before starting the replacement. Prepare the [worktree state](#langgraph-state-across-worktrees) before startup.

```bash
make build-dashboard   # pnpm install + Vite build into ui/.output/public
make dev               # langgraph dev on http://localhost:2024, serving the API and the dashboard
```

`langgraph dev` serves the graphs, the FastAPI app, and the dashboard build together on port 2024. The bundled UI is a static build, so rebuild it when you pull UI changes, or skip `make build-dashboard` if you only need webhooks and the API. It reloads on code changes only: after editing `.env`, restart it.

**Working on the UI?** Have the backend front the Vite dev server instead of serving a build:

```bash
make dev-ui   # Vite on :3000 and the backend on :2024 forwarding UI requests to it, in one terminal
```

`make dev-ui` runs `make web` and `make dev` side by side, the backend with `DASHBOARD_DEV_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000`; Ctrl-C stops both. Open `http://localhost:2024` as usual: the page, its modules, and hot module replacement come from Vite, while `/dashboard/api/*` and the LangGraph routes stay with the backend. Nothing else changes, because the browser never leaves port 2024. The HMR WebSocket connects straight to Vite's port; the UI's Vite config points the client there.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | Dashboard |
| `POST /webhooks/github` | GitHub issue, PR, and comment webhooks |
| `POST /webhooks/slack`, `POST /webhooks/slack/interactivity` | Slack events and Block Kit interactions |
| `POST /webhooks/linear` | Linear comment webhooks |
| `GET /dashboard/api/auth/login`, `GET /dashboard/api/auth/callback` | GitHub login |
| `/dashboard/api/*` | Dashboard API |
| `GET /ok`, `GET /health` | Health checks |

> `make run` serves the FastAPI app alone with uvicorn on port 8000, without the LangGraph runtime. Nothing that creates runs works there; use `make dev`.

## 7. Verify it works

Before reporting readiness, verify `/ok` on localhost, open the dashboard in a browser, and check tunnel forwarding and the OAuth callback redirect. A healthy `/ok` does not mean the UI is ready: `make dev` needs a dashboard build or a running Vite server to serve it.

**Dashboard.** Open `http://localhost:2024`, click **Sign in with GitHub**, and you should land logged in. With your login in `CONFIGURED_ADMINS`, the **Admin** pages appear. Set **Admin → Global defaults → Default Repository**, then start a task from the composer.

**Slack.** With the tunnel running and the Request URL verified, invite your bot to a channel and mention it: `@open_swe_you what's in the repo?`. It replies in a thread; ngrok's inspector at `http://localhost:4040` shows the event arriving.

**GitHub.** With the tunnel running and the App's webhook pointed at it, comment `@openswe what files are in this repo?` on an issue in a repository where the App is installed. Within a few seconds you should see a 👀 reaction, a run in your LangSmith project, and a reply comment. GitHub-triggered runs act as the commenting user, so that account has to have signed in to your local dashboard once. The App's **Advanced** tab lists every delivery and its response, and ngrok's inspector at `http://localhost:4040` shows what arrived.

Record the worktree, process IDs, fixed tunnel domain, and state location in ignored `logs/local-dev/` notes in the primary checkout so the next session can reuse them.

## LangGraph state across worktrees

`langgraph dev` persists local threads, checkpoints, and Store data under `.langgraph_api` in its working directory. Preserve existing local data when moving development to a new worktree unless you want a clean start.

The repository's [`.worktreeinclude`](../.worktreeinclude) includes the root `.langgraph_api` directory. [Local Codex-managed worktrees](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/environments/git-worktrees#copy-ignored-local-files-into-managed-worktrees) copy matching ignored files when they are created. Stop the source backend gracefully so it flushes persistence, and back up its state before creating the worktree. This is a snapshot, not ongoing synchronization.

Codex skips source symlinks and preserves files already present in the destination. Create the worktree from the primary checkout containing the actual state directory. For worktrees created with `git worktree add`, or when the source is a symlink, copy the stopped primary checkout's entire `.langgraph_api` directory manually, including hidden files. Preserve any existing destination state rather than overwriting it automatically.

For one continuous local instance across worktrees, link `.langgraph_api` to the primary checkout's state directory instead of copying it. Only one backend may use that shared directory at a time; restart from the desired worktree to switch code. Independently copied state diverges after creation and also retains schedules and integration settings, so avoid running multiple copies against the same live integrations, which can duplicate background work.

Keep state, backups, and environment files ignored by Git. Reuse the existing local environment, including its token-encryption settings, without printing credentials. `.worktreeinclude` copies local state into worktrees; it does not add that state to version control.

## Dashboard on the Vite dev server directly

`make dev-ui` is the simple way to develop the UI. Opening Vite on `http://localhost:3000` directly also works:

```bash
pnpm install      # from the repo root: ui/ and desktop/ are one pnpm workspace
make web          # Vite on http://localhost:3000, proxying /dashboard/api/* to DASHBOARD_API_URL (default http://localhost:2024)
```

The browser now talks to `http://localhost:3000`, so the session cookie has to be set on that origin and the login callback has to return there:

```bash
DASHBOARD_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"       # the frontend origin; allowed for the CSRF check and post-login redirects
DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"   # what browsers use for /dashboard/api/* and the OAuth callback
```

and the GitHub App needs `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/api/auth/callback` as an additional callback URL. Keep both URLs on `http://` locally so the cookie is `SameSite=Lax`. `DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` lists **additional** origins that may call the API with credentials; credentialed CORS is only enabled when it is set, and `*` is rejected.

## Dashboard against a deployed backend

`pnpm run dev:prod` runs the Vite dev server, hot reload and all, against a deployment instead of a local backend — UI work against real threads, repositories, and settings without running the agent locally. Put the deployment in `.env` (step 5's file, gitignored):

```bash
DASHBOARD_API_URL=https://your-deployment.example.com   # a preview deploy, not production
```

then `pnpm run dev:prod`. There is no default, because a fallback would be someone else's production. `DASHBOARD_API_URL` in the environment overrides the file, and it is the only key read out of `.env`: the rest of it is the local backend's secrets, which have no business in the environment of a dev server the browser talks to.

The first run opens your browser to sign in. That leg still runs against the deployment's own registered GitHub callback — nothing changes on the GitHub App, and nothing changes on the deployment. It is the PKCE loopback handoff the desktop app uses (`?desktop_handoff=…&desktop_port=…`): the deployment redirects your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback` with a code that lives 120 seconds, and the script exchanges it at `/dashboard/api/auth/desktop/exchange` for a session. That tab then waits for Vite and sends you on to the dev server, so signing in ends where you want to be. The session lasts a week and is cached in `~/.cache/open-swe/dev-session.json`; after that you sign in again.

The dev server then attaches that session to everything it proxies, and presents the deployment's own origin so its CSRF check accepts mutations. **The session is real.** A task started from `http://localhost:3000` is a real run on that deployment, and the Admin pages edit its real settings.

`pnpm run build`, `pnpm run typecheck`, and `pnpm run test` run across the workspace through Turborepo (`pnpm --filter open-swe-dashboard run <script>` scopes one); `pnpm run lint` (oxlint) and `pnpm run format` / `pnpm run format:check` (oxfmt) run once from the root over every JS and TS file.

## Desktop app (experimental)

The Electron app in `desktop/` includes the compiled dashboard UI. Run it next to the backend:

```bash
pnpm install                  # from the repo root
make dev                      # terminal 1
pnpm run dev:desktop          # terminal 2
```

Development connects to `http://localhost:2024`. For a hosted backend run `pnpm --dir desktop run start -- --backend-url=https://your-backend.example.com` or set `OPEN_SWE_BACKEND_URL`. `pnpm --dir desktop run pack` creates an unpacked application and `pnpm --dir desktop run dist` an installer. Packaged builds ask for the organization's backend URL on first launch and never default to the maintainers' deployment. The GitHub App must allow `<backend-url>/dashboard/api/auth/callback` for desktop login.

## Make targets

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make dev` | `langgraph dev` on port 2024: graphs, webhooks, dashboard API, and the bundled dashboard when a build exists |
| `make dev-ui` | `make web` and `make dev` together, the backend fronting Vite so the UI hot-reloads on port 2024 |
| `make web` | The Vite dev server alone on port 3000 |
| `make build-dashboard` | Installs the dashboard's dependencies and builds it into `ui/.output/public` |
| `make tunnel NGROK_DOMAIN=…` | `ngrok http 2024` on your static domain, exposing only `/webhooks/*` |
| `make run` | The FastAPI app alone on port 8000, no LangGraph runtime |
| `make desktop` | The Electron app in development, against a backend on port 2024 |
| `make install` | `uv sync --extra dev` |
| `make test [TEST_FILE=tests/…]` | `pytest -vvv` on `tests/` or the given path |
| `make lint`, `make format`, `make format-check` | ruff check and format (`format` rewrites files) |
| `make typecheck` | `ty check agent tests` |

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook not receiving events

- The tunnel must be running (`make tunnel`) against port 2024, and the URL in GitHub or Slack must be your ngrok domain. Do not swap in a tunnel that forwards the whole port; see step 3. GitHub shows each delivery under the App's **Advanced** tab; ngrok's inspector at `http://localhost:4040` shows what arrived. With the webhooks-only policy, ngrok itself answers 404 for anything outside `/webhooks/*`, so test with `/webhooks/slack`, not `/ok`.
- Restart the backend after changing `.env`: `langgraph dev` reloads on code changes only, so a new `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` or `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` is not picked up until then, and every delivery is rejected as `Invalid signature` in the meantime. Slack then needs **Retry** on its Request URL under **Event Subscriptions**.
- Webhook secrets are required: without `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, or `LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, every request to that endpoint is rejected with 401.

### Dashboard login fails or won't stay logged in

- `redirect_uri is not associated with this application`: the App must list `http://localhost:2024/dashboard/api/auth/callback` (or the `:3000` one when you open Vite directly). Add it in the App's settings.
- Login redirects but the session does not stick: keep local URLs on `http://` so the cookie is `SameSite=Lax`.
- `DASHBOARD_BASE_URL not configured` on Sign in with Slack or Notion: the backend has neither a dashboard build nor `DASHBOARD_DEV_SERVER_URL`, so it does not know where the dashboard is. Run `make build-dashboard` or use `make dev-ui`.
- Admin pages 403: add your GitHub login or email to `CONFIGURED_ADMINS`.

### Dashboard shows the LangGraph JSON instead of the UI, or 404s at `/`

- There is no dashboard build: run `make build-dashboard`, or use `make dev-ui`.
- With Vite on port 3000, `curl -i http://localhost:3000/dashboard/api/me` should return the backend's `401`, not HTML; otherwise export `DASHBOARD_API_URL` before `make web`.

### `Port 3000 is already in use`

`make dev-ui` and `make web` refuse to start when another Vite is still running (Vite is configured with `strictPort`). Stop the old one or check `lsof -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN`.

For sandbox, token-encryption, and "agent not responding" problems, see the installation guide's [Troubleshooting](INSTALLATION.md#troubleshooting).
