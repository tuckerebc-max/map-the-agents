# Customization Guide

Open SWE is designed to be forked and customized for your org. The core agent is assembled in a single function — `get_agent()` in `agent/server.py` — where you can swap out the sandbox, model, tools, and triggers.

```python
# agent/server.py — the key lines
model_id = os.environ.get("LLM_MODEL_ID", DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_ID)
model_kwargs = {"max_tokens": DEFAULT_LLM_MAX_TOKENS}
if model_id == DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_ID:
    model_kwargs["reasoning"] = DEFAULT_LLM_REASONING

return create_deep_agent(
    model=make_model(model_id, **model_kwargs),
    system_prompt=construct_system_prompt(...),
    tools=[http_request, fetch_url, slack_thread_reply],
    backend=sandbox_backend,
    middleware=[
        ToolErrorMiddleware(),
        check_message_queue_before_model,
        notify_step_limit_reached,
    ],
)
```

## 1. Sandbox

By default, Open SWE runs each task in a [LangSmith cloud sandbox](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) — an isolated Linux environment where the agent clones the repo and executes commands. Sandbox creation and connection is handled in `agent/sandboxes/providers/langsmith.py`.

### Using a custom sandbox snapshot

Build a snapshot in LangSmith (UI or `SandboxClient.create_snapshot`) from your Docker image and point Open SWE at its UUID:

```bash
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT_ID="<snapshot-uuid>"                      # Optional; defaults to LangSmith's root snapshot
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT_FS_CAPACITY_BYTES="137438953472"          # Optional, default 128 GiB
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_VCPUS="4"                                          # Optional, default 4
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_MEM_BYTES="17179869184"                            # Optional, default 16 GiB
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_IDLE_TTL_SECONDS="7200"                            # Optional, default 7200 (2 h); 0 disables
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_DELETE_AFTER_STOP_SECONDS="2592000"                # Optional, default 2592000 (30 d); 0 disables
```

This is useful for pre-installing languages, frameworks, or internal tools that your repos depend on — reducing setup time per agent run. The default snapshot includes the GitHub CLI; agents invoke it as `gh <command>` and rely on the LangSmith proxy for the real credentials.

`DEFAULT_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT_ID` is only the deployment default. Admins can override it at runtime — from the **Sandbox** page or via `PUT /dashboard/api/sandbox-settings` — so a rebuilt image can be rolled out without a redeploy. See [INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md) and `examples/github-actions/set-base-snapshot.yml` for the CI flow.

For LangSmith sandboxes, Open SWE configures two GitHub proxy rules whenever a sandbox is created or reattached to a run:

- `github.com` / `*.github.com` receive Basic auth for git-over-HTTPS operations.
- `api.github.com` receives Bearer auth for `gh` and REST API operations.

The proxy token is minted at runtime from the GitHub App installation credentials. Do not store GitHub access tokens as deployment environment variables.

### Using a different sandbox provider

Set the `SANDBOX_TYPE` environment variable to switch providers. Each provider has a corresponding integration file in `agent/sandboxes/providers/` and a factory function registered in `agent/sandboxes/providers/registry.py`:

| `SANDBOX_TYPE` | Integration file | Required env vars |
|---|---|---|
| `langsmith` (default) | `agent/sandboxes/providers/langsmith.py` | `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`, `SANDBOX_TYPE="langsmith"` |
| `daytona` | `agent/sandboxes/providers/daytona.py` | `DAYTONA_API_KEY`, `SANDBOX_TYPE="daytona"`, optional `DAYTONA_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT` |
| `runloop` | `agent/sandboxes/providers/runloop.py` | `RUNLOOP_API_KEY`, `SANDBOX_TYPE="runloop"` |
| `e2b` | `agent/sandboxes/providers/e2b.py` | `E2B_API_KEY`, `SANDBOX_TYPE="e2b"`, optional `E2B_TEMPLATE` |
| `modal` | `agent/sandboxes/providers/modal.py` | Modal credentials, `SANDBOX_TYPE="modal"` |
| `local` | `agent/sandboxes/providers/local.py` | None (no isolation — development only), `SANDBOX_TYPE="local"` |

> **Warning**: `local` runs commands directly on your host with no sandboxing. Only use for local development with human-in-the-loop enabled.

For `langsmith`, sandbox provisioning, connection, proxy configuration, and environment snapshot captures use the deployment’s `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` and `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT`. The `DEFAULT_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT_ID` must exist in that LangSmith workspace. The former `SANDBOX_LANGSMITH_API_KEY` and `SANDBOX_LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT` overrides are no longer used.

### Adding a new sandbox provider

1. **Create an integration file** at `agent/sandboxes/providers/my_provider.py` with a factory function matching this signature:

```python
def create_my_provider_sandbox(sandbox_id: str | None = None):
    """Create or reconnect to a sandbox.

    Args:
        sandbox_id: Optional existing sandbox ID to reconnect to.
            If None, creates a new sandbox.

    Returns:
        An object implementing SandboxBackendProtocol.
    """
    ...
```

2. **Register it** in `agent/sandboxes/providers/registry.py` by adding it to `SANDBOX_FACTORIES`:

```python
SANDBOX_FACTORIES = {
    ...
    "my_provider": ("agent.sandboxes.providers.my_provider", "create_my_provider_sandbox"),
}
```

The factory must return an object implementing `SandboxBackendProtocol` from `deepagents`. See the existing integration files for reference.

### Building a custom sandbox provider

If none of the built-in providers fit, you can build your own. The agent accepts any backend that implements `SandboxBackendProtocol` from `deepagents`. The protocol requires:

- **File operations**: `ls()`, `read()`, `write()`, `edit()`, `glob()`, `grep()`
- **Shell execution**: `execute(command, timeout=None) -> ExecuteResponse`
- **Identity**: `id` property returning a unique sandbox identifier

The easiest approach is to extend `BaseSandbox` from `deepagents.backends.sandbox` — it implements all file operations by delegating to `execute()`, so you only need to implement the shell execution layer:

```python
from deepagents.backends.sandbox import BaseSandbox
from deepagents.backends.protocol import ExecuteResponse


class MySandbox(BaseSandbox):
    def __init__(self, connection):
        self._conn = connection

    @property
    def id(self) -> str:
        return self._conn.id

    def execute(self, command: str, *, timeout: int | None = None) -> ExecuteResponse:
        result = self._conn.run(command, timeout=timeout or 300)
        return ExecuteResponse(
            output=result.stdout + result.stderr,
            exit_code=result.exit_code,
            truncated=False,
        )
```

See `deepagents.backends.LangSmithSandbox` and `agent/sandboxes/providers/langsmith.py` for a full reference implementation.

## 2. Model

Set optional deployment defaults with `LLM_MODEL_ID` and `LLM_REASONING_EFFORT`:

```bash
LLM_MODEL_ID="anthropic:claude-sonnet-5"
LLM_REASONING_EFFORT="high"
```

When `LLM_MODEL_ID` is unset or blank, an Anthropic-only deployment—`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set while `OPENAI_API_KEY` is unset or empty—defaults to `anthropic:claude-opus-5`. All other deployments default to `openai:gpt-5.6-sol`, including deployments with both keys set. The default reasoning effort is `medium`.

Either variable can be set independently. When only the model is set, `medium` is used if supported, otherwise that model's catalog default effort is used. The model must be an allowed default in `agent/dashboard/options.py`; unsupported models or incompatible efforts raise a configuration error when defaults are resolved.

These defaults apply below explicit run, thread, profile, and team selections, including inherited reviewer and subagent defaults. Existing selections are not overwritten. Restart the backend after changing its environment.

`max_tokens` is a maximum completion/output token budget, not the model's total context window. For OpenAI reasoning models, this budget can include both internal reasoning tokens and final response tokens.

### Switching models

Use the `provider:model` format:

```python
# Anthropic
model = make_model("anthropic:claude-sonnet-5", temperature=0, max_tokens=16_000)

# OpenAI (uses Responses API by default)
model = make_model("openai:gpt-5.6-sol", max_tokens=128_000, reasoning={"effort": "medium"})

# Google
model = make_model("google_genai:gemini-2.5-pro", temperature=0, max_tokens=16_000)
```

The `make_model()` helper in `agent/utils/model.py` wraps `langchain.chat_models.init_chat_model`. For OpenAI models, it automatically enables the Responses API. For full control, pass a pre-configured model instance directly:

```python
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

model = ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-sonnet-5", temperature=0, max_tokens=16_000)

return create_deep_agent(
    model=model,
    ...
)
```

### Using different models per context

You can route to different models based on task complexity, repo, or trigger source:

```python
async def get_agent(config: RunnableConfig) -> Pregel:
    source = config["configurable"].get("source")
    
    if source == "slack":
        # Faster model for Slack Q&A
        model = make_model("anthropic:claude-sonnet-5", temperature=0, max_tokens=16_000)
    else:
        # Full model for code changes from Linear
        model = make_model("openai:gpt-5.6-sol", max_tokens=128_000, reasoning={"effort": "medium"})
    
    return create_deep_agent(model=model, ...)
```

### Routing through the LangSmith LLM Gateway

Model calls can be proxied through the [LangSmith LLM Gateway](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/llm-gateway) (private beta) instead of hitting providers directly. The gateway authenticates with a **LangSmith API key** that has the `gateway:invoke` permission and resolves the real provider key from workspace Provider Secrets, so no provider API keys are needed at runtime — and it adds central spend limits, PII/secrets redaction, and tracing. Your org must have the gateway enabled with Provider Secrets configured.

Routing is opt-in and off by default. Enable it either way:

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LANGSMITH_GATEWAY_ENABLED` | on when `LANGSMITH_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is set, else off | Deployment-level default for gateway routing; set explicitly to override. |
| `LANGSMITH_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | unset | Dedicated LangSmith key for Gateway calls; setting it also turns routing on. Prefer this in LangGraph Cloud if the platform-provided `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` lacks `gateway:invoke`. Falls back to `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` when routing is enabled some other way. |
| `LANGSMITH_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` | `https://gateway.smith.langchain.com` | Override for a regional or self-hosted gateway host. |
| `LANGSMITH_GATEWAY_OPENAI_USE_RESPONSES` | `true` | Use the OpenAI Responses API through the gateway. Set to `false` only to force Chat Completions for OpenAI models. |

The admin panel (**Admin → LLM Gateway**) exposes a per-workspace toggle stored in team settings; when set it overrides the `LANGSMITH_GATEWAY_ENABLED` env default (a `None`/unset team value inherits the env default).

Routing is applied centrally in `make_model` (`agent/utils/model.py`), which resolves the effective on/off and delegates URL/key wiring to `agent/utils/gateway.py`. **OpenAI, Anthropic, Baseten, Fireworks, and Google Gemini** are routed; Google Vertex (service-account auth) and any other provider call the provider directly with a logged warning. Baseten uses `BASETEN_API_KEY` from LangSmith workspace Provider Secrets through Gateway, or the runtime environment for direct calls.

**Caveat — OpenAI endpoint:** Open SWE uses the OpenAI Responses API by default because OpenAI reasoning models with function tools reject `reasoning_effort` on Chat Completions. Direct OpenAI calls use a `wss://` base URL; gateway-routed OpenAI uses the HTTPS gateway base URL with Responses enabled. Set `LANGSMITH_GATEWAY_OPENAI_USE_RESPONSES=false` only if you need to force Chat Completions. Anthropic, Baseten, and Fireworks are unaffected.

## 3. Tools

Open SWE ships with a small set of custom tools on top of the built-in Deep Agents tools (file reads, writes, edits, deletes, search, shell execution, and subagents). GitHub operations are handled by `gh` inside the sandbox.

| Tool | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `fetch_url` | `agent/tools/fetch_url.py` | Fetch web pages as markdown |
| `http_request` | `agent/tools/http_request.py` | HTTP API calls |
| `slack_attach_html` | `agent/slack/tools/attach_html.py` | Attach sandbox HTML previews to Slack threads |
| `slack_thread_reply` | `agent/slack/tools/thread_reply.py` | Reply in Slack threads |

### Workspace MCP servers

Admins can connect generic remote MCP servers under **Admin → Workspace MCPs**.
Connections belong to this Open SWE deployment and are shared across repositories
and remote coding-agent threads. Enabled connections provide baseline tools for
all users, limited to the tools selected by an admin. Only admins can manage
connections or reveal saved credentials. Plan mode continues to block workspace
MCP tools.

1. Choose **Add MCP server** and enter a unique lowercase connection name, an
   HTTPS server URL, and its transport (**Streamable HTTP** or **SSE**).
2. Choose **Headers / API key** or **OAuth client credentials** for authentication.
   For headers, values are encrypted using `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
   in the LangGraph Store; normal dashboard responses only return header names.
   Admins can use the eye icon (**Show saved headers**) to reveal values on demand,
   then the crossed-out eye to clear them from the editor. Entered or imported
   values also have an eye icon to show or hide them. Use headers
   for credentials, rather than URL query parameters.
   For OAuth, enter the token URL, client ID, client secret, scopes, and the
   provider's client authentication method. The secret is encrypted in the Store
   and is never returned to the browser. Leave it blank when editing to keep it.
3. Choose **Save and discover tools**. For new connections, all discovered tools
   are selected by default. Review the selection, then choose **Save connection**
   to enable those tools. Rediscovering an existing connection preserves its
   selected tools, including an intentionally empty selection. Newly added tools
   on the remote server require explicit selection.
   Discovery checks the draft before saving; if it fails, no connection is
   created and existing settings stay unchanged. Discovery only lists tools.

Alternatively, choose **Import JSON** and paste a Claude-style configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "datadog": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.us5.datadoghq.com/v1/mcp?toolsets=core",
      "headers": {
        "DD_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "DD_APPLICATION_KEY": "YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Datadog, LangSmith, Linear, and Currents agent tools are configured through
Workspace MCPs. The dedicated Datadog and Currents credentials forms and built-in
provider tools have been removed. Reconnect Datadog using the MCP configuration
above; legacy saved credentials are not migrated automatically. Use the JSON
import or connection form to add the other MCP servers as needed.

The [Currents MCP server](https://github.com/currents-dev/currents-mcp) wraps the
Currents REST API. Run its Streamable HTTP server on an HTTPS host reachable by
Open SWE, then configure its `/mcp` URL with an `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
header. The Currents REST API URL itself does not speak MCP, and the local
`npx @currents/mcp` command cannot be imported as a workspace connection.

Optional reviewer trace resolution and personal LangSmith credential proxying
have been removed. Configure agent access to LangSmith through Workspace MCPs.
Sandbox provisioning uses the deployment's `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` and
`LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT`. Linear webhook intake uses the signed webhook setup;
configure Linear replies and other agent operations through Workspace MCPs.
Automatic failure notices use the workspace connection named `linear` and its
selected `save_comment` tool (`create_comment` is also supported). These notices
run independently of the agent and honor the connection's enabled state and tool
selection. Delivery failures are logged without marking the run as notified.

Use the endpoint for your Datadog site (this example uses US5). Replace the key
placeholders directly in the dashboard. Import supports multiple named servers,
optional `type` (`http` by default, or `sse`), and string authentication headers.
It opens each connection for review without saving automatically. Existing
connections keep their enabled state and selected tools. Local `command` servers
and environment-variable expansion are not supported.

For a Linear OAuth application, enable **Client credentials tokens** in the
application's settings, then import this configuration. The `oauth` object is
an Open SWE extension to the remote MCP JSON format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp",
      "oauth": {
        "grant_type": "client_credentials",
        "token_url": "https://api.linear.app/oauth/token",
        "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
        "scope": "read,write",
        "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_post"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Client credentials require no redirect URI. Open SWE requests a bearer token,
caches it in memory until shortly before expiry, and obtains another when needed.
A rejected token is renewed once on HTTP 401. Client credentials go only to the
configured token URL; bearer tokens go to the MCP server. Both destinations use
the same public HTTPS address validation and redirect restrictions. An explicit
`Authorization` header cannot be combined with OAuth.

Other providers can use the same `oauth` settings with their own token URL and
scope format; `client_secret_basic` sends credentials using HTTP Basic instead
of the request body. Changing the token URL, client ID, or MCP URL requires
re-entering the client secret. Sending `oauth: null` removes OAuth credentials;
omitting `oauth` from a partial API update preserves them. Linear documents this
flow under [client credentials tokens](https://linear.app/developers/oauth-2-0-authentication#client-credentials-tokens).

Examples for the generic connection form:

| Connection | URL | Authentication headers |
|---|---|---|
| `incident` | `https://mcp.incident.io/mcp` | `Authorization`: `Bearer <your incident.io API key>` |
| `datadog` | `https://mcp.datadoghq.com/v1/mcp?toolsets=core` | `DD_API_KEY`: your API key; `DD_APPLICATION_KEY`: your application key |

Both examples use Streamable HTTP. Choose the Datadog MCP hostname for your site
(for example, `mcp.datadoghq.eu`). Use appropriately scoped provider keys and
select the read tools you need for investigation. The incident.io authentication
and catalog are documented in [its remote MCP guide](https://docs.incident.io/ai/remote-mcp).
Datadog documents its headers and site-specific endpoints in the
[MCP setup guide](https://docs.datadoghq.com/mcp_server/setup/#api-and-application-keys).
Enter Datadog key values directly, without a `Bearer` prefix. The `core` toolset
includes logs, metrics, traces, dashboards, monitors, and incidents.

Allowed tools appear in the agent's **MCPs** tool group with connection
prefixes such as `mcp_incident_incident_list_…` and a suffix to prevent naming
collisions. Catalogs are cached for ten minutes
per settings revision. Changing a connection causes the next run to discover its
catalog again. Every tool call reloads the current authentication settings and checks whether the
connection and tool are still enabled. Disabling or deleting a connection blocks
subsequent calls from already-loaded tools; it does not cancel an in-flight call.

Editing keeps saved headers unless **Replace headers** is selected. Replacing
with an empty header list clears those headers. Changing the URL requires
explicitly replacing or clearing saved headers. Requests must remain on the
configured public HTTPS origin; redirects, private addresses, local processes,
and interactive OAuth login are not supported by this connection manager.

The backend implementation lives in `agent/mcp`: connection models and credential
preparation, OAuth, HTTPS transport, and tool discovery/execution. Workspace storage
and dashboard authorization remain in the workspace adapters. Existing stored
connections and imported JSON need no migration.

For another scope, provide an `MCPSource` with an owner-specific `namespace` plus
async `list_connections` and `get_connection` callbacks. The caller must authorize
each source before passing it to `load_mcp_tools(workspace_source, user_source)`.
Sources are ordered from lowest to highest precedence. Distinct connection names
contribute tools; a later connection with the same name replaces the entire earlier
connection, including credentials and allowed tools. Disabled connections and empty
tool selections also override earlier entries, preventing fallback to broader access.
Saved secrets must only be preserved from the previous record in the same scope.

Catalog and token caches include the source namespace. Each tool call resolves the
current winning connection again, checks its allowlist, and refuses to switch scopes
mid-run. Source lookup errors must raise instead of returning an empty result, so a
failed lookup cannot expose a lower-precedence connection. The product wires the
workspace source and the triggering user's personal source (below) into every remote
coding-agent run.
An unavailable server omits its tools without preventing other connections from
loading. This catalog is not attached to the separate read-only reviewer or
Investigate graphs.

### Personal MCP servers

Any signed-in user can connect remote MCP servers with their own credentials under
**My settings → Personal MCPs**. The form, JSON import, OAuth, header handling, and
tool discovery work exactly like workspace connections. Records live in the Store
under `["user_mcps", <trimmed lowercase github login>]`, so one user's connections and credentials are
never visible to, reused by, or revealed to another user. The dashboard API is
`/dashboard/api/my-mcps` and requires only a signed-in session.

Personal connections load only inside a **private thread owned by the triggering
user**, the same rule that applies to personal Notion connections. Collaborative
(workspace or Slack channel) threads can be prompted by anyone, so they run without
personal credentials; to use yours, continue the thread privately from the dashboard.
Both scopes share the **MCPs** tool group. A personal connection with the same name as a
workspace connection replaces it entirely for that user's runs, and a disabled personal
connection hides the workspace one rather than falling back to it.
Desktop (local) runs do not load MCP connections yet. GitHub PR follow-ups targeting a
private thread are rejected unless the commenter owns that thread, before credentials
are read or a run is dispatched.

### Adding a Python tool

Create a new file in `agent/tools/`, define a function, and add it to the tools list.

**Example — adding a Datadog search tool:**

```python
# agent/tools/datadog_search.py
import requests
from typing import Any


def datadog_search(query: str, time_range: str = "1h") -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Search Datadog logs for debugging context.

    Args:
        query: Datadog log query string
        time_range: Time range to search (e.g. "1h", "24h", "7d")

    Returns:
        Dictionary with matching log entries
    """
    # Your Datadog API integration here
    ...
```

Then register it in `agent/server.py`:

```python
from .tools import fetch_url, http_request, slack_thread_reply
from .tools.datadog_search import datadog_search

return create_deep_agent(
    ...
    tools=[
        http_request, fetch_url,
        slack_thread_reply,
        datadog_search,  # new tool
    ],
    ...
)
```

The agent will automatically see the tool's name, docstring, and parameter types — the docstring serves as the tool description, so write it clearly.

### Removing tools

If you don't use Slack, remove `slack_thread_reply` from the tools list. If you don't need web fetching, remove `fetch_url`.

### Conditional tools

You can vary the toolset based on the trigger source:

```python
base_tools = [http_request, fetch_url]
source = config["configurable"].get("source")

if source == "slack":
    tools = [*base_tools, slack_thread_reply]
else:
    tools = base_tools

return create_deep_agent(tools=tools, ...)
```

---

## 4. Triggers

Open SWE supports three invocation surfaces: Linear, Slack, and GitHub. Each is implemented as a webhook endpoint in `agent/webapp.py`. You can add, remove, or modify triggers independently.

### Removing a trigger

If you don't use Linear, simply don't configure the Linear webhook and remove the env vars. Same for Slack. The webhook endpoints still exist but won't receive events.

To fully remove a trigger's code, delete the corresponding endpoint from `agent/webapp.py`:

- **Linear**: `linear_webhook()` and `process_linear_issue()`
- **Slack**: `slack_webhook()` and `process_slack_mention()`

### Default repository

Set the default GitHub org and repo used across all triggers (Slack, Linear, GitHub) when no repo is specified:

```bash
DEFAULT_REPO_OWNER="my-org"      # Default GitHub org (used everywhere)
DEFAULT_REPO_NAME="my-repo"      # Default GitHub repo (used everywhere)
```

These are used as the fallback when:
- A Slack message doesn't specify a repo (and no thread metadata exists)
- A Linear comment doesn't specify a repo
- A user writes `repo:name` without an org prefix — the org defaults to `DEFAULT_REPO_OWNER`

### Repository extraction from messages

Both Slack and Linear support specifying a target repo directly in the message or comment text. The shared utility `extract_repo_from_text()` in `agent/utils/repo.py` handles parsing these formats:

- `repo:owner/name` — explicit org and repo
- `repo owner/name` — space syntax (same result)
- `repo:name` — repo name only; the org defaults to `DEFAULT_REPO_OWNER`
- `https://github.com/owner/name` — GitHub URL

### Customizing Linear routing

Linear comments use the triggering user's dashboard default repository, then the workspace default repository. Users can override either on a per-comment basis by including `repo:owner/name` in their `@openswe` comment.

### Customizing Slack routing

Slack repo resolution (`get_slack_repo_config` in `agent/webapp.py`) checks, in order:

1. Repo carried over from the existing Slack thread's metadata.
2. A `repo:owner/name` (or GitHub URL) token in the channel's **topic or purpose** (its "description"). This lets a channel be pinned to a repo without anyone repeating it per-message.
3. The triggering user's dashboard `default_repo`.
4. The team default repo.
5. `SLACK_REPO_OWNER`/`SLACK_REPO_NAME`, falling back to `DEFAULT_REPO_OWNER`/`DEFAULT_REPO_NAME`.

Users can still override per-message with `repo:owner/name` syntax in their Slack message (this is read from the message text by the agent). A shorthand `repo:name` (without the org) is also supported — the org defaults to `DEFAULT_REPO_OWNER`.

Reading the channel topic/purpose requires the bot's Slack token to have the `channels:read` (and `groups:read` for private channels) scope so `conversations.info` succeeds.

### Adding a new trigger

To add a new invocation surface (e.g. Jira, Discord, a custom API):

1. **Add a webhook endpoint** in `agent/webapp.py`:

```python
@app.post("/webhooks/my-trigger")
async def my_trigger_webhook(request: Request, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    # Parse the incoming event
    payload = await request.json()
    
    # Extract task description and repo info
    task_description = payload["description"]
    repo_config = {"owner": "my-org", "name": "my-repo"}
    
    # Create a LangGraph run
    background_tasks.add_task(process_my_trigger, task_description, repo_config)
    return {"status": "accepted"}
```

2. **Create a processing function** that builds the prompt and starts an agent run:

```python
async def process_my_trigger(task_description: str, repo_config: dict):
    thread_id = generate_deterministic_id(task_description)
    langgraph_client = get_client(url=LANGGRAPH_URL)

    await langgraph_client.runs.create(
        thread_id,
        "agent",
        input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": task_description}]},
        config={
            "configurable": {
                "repo": repo_config,
                "source": "my-trigger",
                "user_email": "user@example.com",
            }
        },
        if_not_exists="create",
    )
```

3. **Add a communication tool** (optional) so the agent can report back:

```python
# agent/tools/my_trigger_reply.py
def my_trigger_reply(message: str) -> dict:
    """Post a reply to the triggering service."""
    # Your API call here
    ...
```

The key fields in `config.configurable` are:
- `repo`: `{"owner": "...", "name": "..."}` — which GitHub repo to work on
- `source`: string identifying the trigger (used for auth routing and communication)
- `user_email`: the triggering user's email (for GitHub OAuth resolution)

## 5. System prompt

The system prompt is assembled in `agent/prompt.py` from modular sections. You can customize behavior by editing individual sections:

| Section | What it controls |
|---|---|
| `WORKING_ENV_SECTION` | Sandbox paths and execution constraints (or `DESKTOP_WORKING_ENV_SECTION` for local desktop runs) |
| `TASK_EXECUTION_SECTION` | Workflow steps (understand → implement → verify → submit) and PR review dispatch |
| `DEPENDENCY_SECTION` | Installing, vetting, and managing project dependencies |
| `COMMIT_PR_SECTION` | PR title/body format, lint/format steps, and commit conventions (or `DESKTOP_PR_SECTION`) |
| `OPEN_SWE_SHARED_BASE` | Shared core guidance: concise style, core behavior, sandbox operations, code style, and communication |
| `PLAN_MODE_SECTION` | Read-only planning mode instructions |

> **Note:** General code style (`### Working with Code`), communication guidelines (`### Communication`), and core behaviors are composed as subsections of `OPEN_SWE_SHARED_BASE` rather than separate configurable constants.

### Default prompt file

Open SWE supports a `default_prompt.md` file for org-level instructions that apply to **every** agent run, regardless of which repository is being worked on. This is the recommended way to set default repository preferences, org conventions, and shared guidelines.

The file is loaded at agent startup and injected into the system prompt between the task overview and repository setup sections.

**Location:** [`agent/resources/default_prompt.md`](../agent/resources/default_prompt.md) for the bundled default.

**Override:** Set the `DEFAULT_PROMPT_PATH` environment variable to use a different file:

```bash
DEFAULT_PROMPT_PATH="/path/to/my-org-prompt.md"
```

**Format:** Write plain markdown. The content is injected as-is under a `### Custom Instructions` heading in the system prompt. Example:

```markdown
# Default Prompt

## Default Repository

When no repository is specified, work on the **my-app** repository under **my-org**.

## Organization Conventions

- Use conventional commits: feat:, fix:, chore:
- Always tag the requesting user when work is complete
```

**Loading order:** Default prompt → System prompt sections → AGENTS.md (per-repo). If the file is missing or empty, it is silently skipped — no error is raised.

**When to use `default_prompt.md` vs `AGENTS.md`:**

| | `default_prompt.md` | `AGENTS.md` |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | All tasks, all repos | Single repository |
| Location | Open SWE project root | Target repo root |
| Use for | Default repo, org conventions | Repo-specific coding standards |

### Using AGENTS.md

Drop an `AGENTS.md` file in the root of any repository to add repo-specific instructions. The agent reads it from the sandbox at startup and appends it to the system prompt. This is the easiest way to encode conventions per-repo without modifying Open SWE's code.

## 6. Middleware

Middleware hooks run around the agent loop. Open SWE includes:

| Middleware | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ToolErrorMiddleware` | Tool error handler | Catches and formats tool errors |
| `check_message_queue_before_model` | Before model | Injects follow-up messages that arrived mid-run |
| `notify_step_limit_reached` | After agent | Posts a Slack reply when the agent hits the model-call limit |

There is intentionally no after-agent middleware that opens a PR for the agent. The agent is responsible for committing, pushing, opening/updating the draft PR, and replying in the source channel. If you want a deterministic backstop for your fork, add an `@after_agent` hook here.

Add custom middleware by appending to the middleware list in `get_agent()`. See the [LangChain middleware docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/agents/#middleware) for the `@before_model` and `@after_agent` decorators.

**Example — adding a CI check after agent completion:**

```python
from langchain.agents.middleware import AgentState, after_agent
from langgraph.runtime import Runtime


@after_agent
async def run_ci_check(state: AgentState, runtime: Runtime):
    """Run CI checks after the agent finishes."""
    # Trigger your CI pipeline here
    ...
```

Then add it to the middleware list:

```python
middleware = [
    ToolErrorMiddleware(),
    check_message_queue_before_model,
    notify_step_limit_reached,
    run_ci_check,  # new middleware
]
```
