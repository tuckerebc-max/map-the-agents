# Contributing to OpenWiki

Thanks for contributing! Our standard for PR contributions is **one PR = one change**.
This allows us to keep reviews fast and the repo history clean.

## Scope: one PR = one change

Pull requests should be well scoped and every one should do exactly one thing.

Fixing a bug that's part of the change you're making is fine but if you find
yourself fixing something _unrelated_ along the way, open a separate PR for it.

### What "tightly scoped" means

✅ **Good:** "Add Fireworks to the model provider list" — the provider config,
its model options, and the doc line for it.

❌ **Too broad:** "Add a new provider, refactor the credential onboarding flow,
and fix a typo in the README" — three unrelated changes. You should split these
into three PRs.

## Before you open a PR

Run these locally so you don't get surprised by CI:

```sh
pnpm run format
pnpm run lint
pnpm test
```

`format` and `lint` match the checks that run on every PR, and `test`
typechecks, builds, and runs the Vitest suite with coverage.

## Testing coding-agent integrations locally

Install an integration backed by the current checkout with:

```sh
pnpm integrations:dev <codex|claude|opencode|cursor>
```

The command builds OpenWiki, refreshes the host skill, and records absolute
paths to the current Node executable and `dist/cli/cli.js`. Restart the coding
agent after installation. Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, and Cursor install at
user scope. Later source changes only require `pnpm build` unless the bundled
skill itself changes. Rerun `integrations:dev` to refresh the skill or after
switching Node installations.

User-scope destinations match each host's own conventions: Codex writes under
`~/.agents` and `~/.codex`, Claude Code under `~/.claude`, OpenCode under
`~/.config/opencode` (OpenCode's global configuration directory on every
supported platform), and Cursor under `~/.cursor`.

## Adding a coding-agent integration

OpenWiki host integrations share one canonical skill and five MCP tools:
`openwiki_begin`, `openwiki_submit_plan`, `openwiki_next_page`,
`openwiki_submit_page`, and `openwiki_finish`. Add host-specific behavior to the
registry and config boundary rather than copying the skill or adding
host-specific tools. The host model researches and authors only the current
OpenWiki PageJob; OpenWiki owns durable run state, Claims reconciliation,
finalization, metadata, provenance, and managed setup files.

1. Confirm the host discovers repository skills and local stdio MCP servers.
   Document the supported user and project paths; use `null` for an unsupported
   user scope rather than inventing a global skill location.
2. Add the host ID to `HostTargetId` in
   `src/integrations/install/types.ts`, then add its display name,
   provenance actor, supported paths, MCP config kind, and documentation URL to
   `HOST_TARGETS` in `src/integrations/install/registry.ts`.
3. Reuse the JSON or Codex TOML config adapter when possible. Add a focused
   adapter only when the host uses a genuinely different config format, while
   preserving unrelated user config and exact ownership checks.
4. Add focused registry, install/status/uninstall, config-conflict, packaging,
   and provenance tests. Pin unsupported scopes and verify project installs
   resolve to the Git root.
5. Run `pnpm integrations:dev <host>` for a real host smoke test, then run
   `pnpm test`, `pnpm run lint:check`, and `pnpm run format:check`.
6. Update the README usage examples and add a changeset for user-visible
   support.

Keep the v1 boundary narrow: host agents use their native repository tools for
investigation and Markdown authoring; OpenWiki owns deterministic preparation,
finalization, metadata, provenance, and managed setup files.

If your change should ship in a release, also add a changeset (see below).

## Changesets

We release with [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). If your
PR changes the published `openwiki` package in a way users should see (a bug fix,
a new feature, or any behavior change), add a changeset:

```sh
pnpm changeset
```

Pick the bump type, write a short summary, and commit the generated
`.changeset/*.md` file with your PR. The summary becomes the changelog entry, so
write it for users rather than reviewers. Bump types follow semver:

- **patch** for bug fixes and other small, backward-compatible changes
- **minor** for new, backward-compatible features
- **major** for breaking changes

Changes that do not affect the published package (docs, tests, CI, internal
refactors) do not need a changeset. If a change touches the package but should
not trigger a release, record that intent with an empty one: `pnpm changeset --empty`.

Once your PR merges, the Release workflow opens a "chore: version packages" PR
that collects the pending changesets. Merging that PR bumps the version, updates
`CHANGELOG.md`, and publishes the release.

## PR expectations

- **Clear title** — a single sentence describing the one change, prefixed with a
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) type such as
  `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:` (e.g. `feat: add Fireworks to the model provider list`).
- **What and why** — briefly explain what the PR does and the reason for it.
- **How you tested it** — describe the tests (unit or end-to-end) that verify your
  change works and doesn't break existing behavior. If you added or updated tests,
  note them here.
- **Add a changeset** for any user-facing change so it lands in the changelog and
  the next release. See [Changesets](#changesets).
- **Link an issue** for anything non-trivial, so the change has context.

## A note for AI agents

If you are an agent opening a PR in this repository, these rules are binding.
Keep your change tightly scoped to a single concern. **If a change you're about
to make would violate anything in this document, stop and surface it to the
human instead of proceeding.**

## What gets closed

PRs that bundle multiple unrelated changes may be closed with a request to
split them into separate, tightly scoped PRs.
