# OpenCode Agent Orchestrator

A lightweight OpenCode configuration that implements a practical orchestrator pattern for AI-assisted software development.

The goal is to get the benefits of a multi-agent workflow - planning, execution, review, and security checks - without turning the setup into a complex agent framework or adding excessive token overhead.

## Why this exists

Single-agent workflows are often enough for small tasks, but they tend to become less reliable as work gets larger or more ambiguous. Common issues include:

- Planning and implementation getting mixed together
- Repeated context consuming unnecessary tokens
- Reviews being skipped or performed inconsistently
- Security, documentation, and testing concerns being handled too late
- Large tasks producing broad, hard-to-review diffs
- Inefficient token usage when the same model is applied to tasks of varying complexity

This repository provides a small orchestrator-based pattern that keeps the workflow structured while remaining easy to inspect, modify, and run.

## What this provides

- **A very simple orchestrator pattern** - A central agent coordinates planning, approval, implementation, and review phases that you can build upon and customize as needed.
- **Scoped subagents** - Specialized agents handle planning, execution, testing, documentation, security, and code review
- **Token-conscious delegation** - Subagents receive focused tasks instead of the full problem context whenever possible
- **Approval-gated planning** - Non-trivial work is planned before implementation starts
- **Minimal framework overhead** - The system is implemented as OpenCode configuration, agent prompts, skills, and a small plugin
- **Reusable development skills** - Shared skill definitions for delegation, task management, Python quality, and security investigation

## Design goals

This project is intentionally small. It is not trying to be a general-purpose agent platform.

It aims to:

- Keep orchestration understandable
- Reduce unnecessary context passed between agents
- Preserve code quality through explicit planning and review steps
- Make agent responsibilities clear
- Avoid excessive automation that hides what is happening
- Provide a useful starting point for customizing OpenCode workflows
- Sync the improvements with my own personal workflow.

## How the workflow works

The default entry point is the `orchestrator` agent.

For non-trivial tasks, the workflow typically follows this pattern:

1. **Orchestrator receives the user request**
2. **Planning is delegated** to a planning subagent
3. **A concrete plan is written** under `.opencode/plans/`
4. **The user approves or rejects the plan**
5. **Implementation is delegated** in scoped slices
6. **Review agents validate the result** for correctness, tests, documentation impact, and security concerns

This keeps the main agent focused on coordination instead of forcing one large prompt/session to handle every phase of the task.

## Agents

### Primary agents (Strong models) - Currently Using DeepSeek V4 Pro/GLM 5.3 Flash

- **orchestrator** - Coordinates multi-phase work through plan files, approval gates, and implementation slices
- **build** - OpenCode Default Agent (Best for simple tasks)
- **plan** - OpenCode Default Agent  (Best for simple tasks)

### Subagents (Cheap models) - Currently Using DeepSeek V4 Flash/Qwen3.8 Flash

- **plan-runner** - Drafts implementation plans under `.opencode/plans/`
- **code-executor** - Implements scoped coding tasks with minimal diffs
- **test-verifier** - Validates changes through tests, linting, and type checking
- **code-reviewer** - Reviews diffs for correctness, maintainability, and implementation risk
- **docs-reviewer** - Checks whether documentation needs to be updated
- **security-reviewer** - Identifies security risks in application code
- **spec-critic** - Challenges plans before coding starts
- **api-docs-researcher** - Researches external API documentation
- **host-security-investigator** - Assesses hosting and infrastructure security concerns

## When to use this

This configuration is useful when you want:

- More structure than a single-agent coding workflow
- Planning before implementation
- Smaller, easier-to-review diffs
- Separate review passes for tests, docs, code quality, and security
- A multi-agent setup that is still simple enough to understand and modify

It may be unnecessary for very small edits where a direct `build` agent is faster and cheaper.

## Playing with profiles

Slowly adding new opencode.jsonc files to `profiles/*` that can be used to quick explore different models
and combinations of agents. Simply use the default `opencode.jsonc` if you don't want to test anything. Profiles are merged additively on top of the global config, so plugins and permissions are inherited from `opencode.jsonc` — profile files only need to override models and variants.

You can select a profile by using OpenCode's `OPENCODE_CONFIG` environment variable, that makes it super easy:

Currently available test profiles:

| Profile | Configuration | Models |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Default             | `opencode.jsonc`                          | Deepseek V4 Pro / Flash
| Budget / DeepSeek Vision | `profiles/budget/deepseek-vision/opencode.jsonc` | Deepseek V4 Pro / Deepseek V4 Flash Vision Exp |
| Budget / GLM + Qwen | `profiles/budget/glm-qwen/opencode.jsonc` | GLM-5.3 / Qwen3.8

Replace `<profile>` below with the desired profile path, for example `budget/glm-qwen`.

### Bash / Zsh

Current session:

```sh
export OPENCODE_CONFIG="$HOME/.config/opencode/profiles/<profile>/opencode.jsonc"
```

For persistent use, add the same `export` command to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

### PowerShell

Current session:

```powershell
$env:OPENCODE_CONFIG = "$HOME\.config\opencode\profiles\<profile>\opencode.jsonc"
```

Persistent:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "OPENCODE_CONFIG",
    "$HOME\.config\opencode\profiles\<profile>\opencode.jsonc",
    "User"
)
```

> These examples assume the repository is installed at `~/.config/opencode`. Adjust the base path if you installed it elsewhere.

### Fish

Current session:

```fish
set -x OPENCODE_CONFIG "$HOME/.config/opencode/profiles/<profile>/opencode.jsonc"
```

Persistent:

```fish
set -Ux OPENCODE_CONFIG "$HOME/.config/opencode/profiles/<profile>/opencode.jsonc"
```

## Plugins

### Plan post-approval handoff

`plugin-src/plan-post-approval.ts` (loaded via the `plugin` tuple in `opencode.jsonc`) automates the handoff after a plan is approved through `PlanApprove`.

It:

- Extracts plan file paths from approval questions
- Uses the last user message `agent` field as routing context
- Hands off `plan` sessions to `build` after idle using `session.summarize` and `session.prompt`
- Avoids duplicate Phase B automation for `orchestrator` sessions when its plugin option `plan_post_approval_handoff_agent` is set to `orchestrator` (passed via the `plugin` tuple in `opencode.jsonc`, not under `agent.orchestrator`, so it never reaches a provider request body)
- Reads `plan_post_approval_handoff_agent` from plugin options first, then falls back to `agent.orchestrator` or root in `opencode.jsonc` (provider-leaky; prefer plugin options)
- Retries `session.prompt` with backoff

## Installation

1. Install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)

2. Clone this repository to your OpenCode config directory:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url> ~/.config/opencode
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ~/.config/opencode
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Start OpenCode and describe your task.

The `orchestrator` agent is configured as the default entry point. For simple tasks, the system can proceed directly. For larger or riskier tasks, it routes work through planning, approval, implementation, and review phases.

The intended flow is:

```text
user request
   ↓
orchestrator
   ↓
plan-runner / plan
   ↓
user approval
   ↓
code-executor / build
   ↓
review subagents
```

## Configuration

Key settings in `opencode.jsonc`:

- **`default_agent: "orchestrator"`** - Sets the orchestrator as the default entry point
- **`permission`** - Provides a minimal deny-by-default workspace baseline; each agent declares its tool policy in `agents/<id>.md` frontmatter
- **`agent.*.model`** - Configures model selection for primary agents and selected subagents
- **`agent.*.variant`** - Per-agent thinking variant (e.g. `"max"`); **`temperature`** - Tune agent behavior where needed
- **`plugin` tuple option `plan_post_approval_handoff_agent`** (for `./plugin-src/plan-post-approval.ts`) - Controls post-approval routing for the plan handoff plugin. Kept out of `agent.orchestrator` so strict providers (GLM, Vertex, Fireworks) don't reject it as an extra request field.


## Changelog

### [1.1.4] - 2026-08-31

- **Added**
  - `profiles/budget/deepseek-vision/` profile (Deepseek V4 Pro primaries / Deepseek V4 Flash Vision Exp subagents).
  - `small_model` pin (`opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash`) in `opencode.jsonc`.
  - `profiles/budget/qwen-mimo/` profile (Qwen3.8 Flash `xhigh` primaries / MiMo V2.5 subagents, no variants).
  - `profiles/budget/glm-deepseek/` profile (GLM 5.3 Flash `max` primaries / DeepSeek V4 Flash `max` subagents).
- **Changed**
  - Global provider `reasoningEffort` block replaced by per-agent `variant: "max"` entries in `opencode.jsonc`.
  - `@opencode-ai/plugin` aligned to 1.14.20; `tsconfig.json` now type-checks `plugin-src/`.
- **Fixed**
  - `profiles/budget/glm-qwen/`: `"variant:"` key typo and stale model comment.
  - Profiles no longer redeclare the `plugin` array — plugins are inherited from the global config, fixing the relative `plugin-src/` path from profile directories.

### [1.1.3] - 2026-06-21

- **Fixed**
  - Moved `plan_post_approval_handoff_agent` out of `agent.orchestrator` (where opencode routed it into the provider request `options`) and into the `plan-post-approval` plugin tuple options. Restores compatibility with strict providers (GLM, Vertex AI, Fireworks) that rejected the extra field with "Extra inputs are not permitted". Same class of fix as the `textVerbosity` removal in [1.1.1].
- **Changed**
  - Relocated `plugins/plan-post-approval.ts` to `plugin-src/plan-post-approval.ts` so it is loaded only via the explicit `plugin` tuple (with options) instead of auto-discovery, avoiding double-load.

### [1.1.2] - 2026-06-21

- **Changed**
  - Updated md files and `opencode.jsonc` so model and temperature are configurable inside the jsonc file.

### [1.1.1] — 2026-06-20

- **Fixed**
  - Removed textVerbosity parameter from `opencode.jsonc` so GLM and other models work properly

### [1.1.0] — 2026-05-12

- **Changed**
  - Orchestrator agent now don't have write permissions by default so we can force subagent usage.
  - Updated agent configurations (orchestrator and all subagents)
  - Updated `opencode.jsonc` with refined model routing, reasoning effort, and permission settings
  - Updated README with structure, workflow, and configuration documentation
- **Fixed**
  - Corrected model names in agent configurations
  - Added DeepSeek max reasoning effort support in `opencode.jsonc`
- **Removed**
  - Build and Plan customization. The config now uses the opencode default Build and Plan agents. Add `agents/build.md` and `agents/plan.md` if you want to override.

### [1.0.0] — 2026-05-02

Initial release: multi-agent orchestrator pattern with planning, code execution, and review subagents.
