# Memory: Persistent Context & Learning

Create and save memories so your agent automatically uses them to create personalized experiences.

## What it does

Dexto's memory system allows agents to:
- **Remember user preferences** across sessions
- **Learn from past interactions** to provide better responses
- **Store important context** for future reference
- **Personalize responses** based on saved information

## How it works

Agents automatically create and retrieve memories during conversations. You can also manually save important information:

```bash
# In any Dexto session
> "Remember that I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript"
> "Save that my timezone is PST"
> "Remember my favorite color is blue"
```

The agent will use these memories in future conversations:

```bash
# Later in a different session
> "Create a new project for me"
# Agent: "I'll create a TypeScript project for you since that's your preference..."
```

## Memory Types

- **User Preferences**: Personal settings and choices
- **Context**: Important background information
- **Facts**: Specific details to remember
- **Learned Patterns**: Behavioral insights from interactions

## Managing Memories
