**Lavra turns your AI coding agent into a development team that gets smarter with every task.**

A plugin for coding agents that orchestrates the full development lifecycle -- from brainstorming to shipping -- while automatically capturing and recalling knowledge so each unit of work makes the next one easier.

### Without Lavra

- The agent forgets everything between sessions -- you re-explain context every time
- Planning is shallow: it jumps to code before thinking through the problem
- Review is inconsistent: sometimes thorough, sometimes a rubber stamp
- Knowledge stays in your head. When a teammate hits the same bug, they start from zero
- Shipping is manual: you run tests, create the PR, close tickets, push -- every time

### With Lavra

- **Automatic memory.** Knowledge is captured inline during work and recalled automatically at the start of every session. Hit the same OAuth bug next month? The agent already knows the fix.
- **Structured planning.** Brainstorm with scope sharpening, research with domain-matched agents, adversarial plan review -- all before a single line of code is written.
- **Disciplined execution.** Agents follow deviation rules (what to auto-fix vs. escalate), commit per task with traceable bead IDs, and verify every success criterion before marking work done.
- **Built-in quality gates.** Every implementation runs through a review-fix-learn loop. Knowledge capture is mandatory, not optional.
- **Team-shareable knowledge.** Memory lives in `.lavra/memory/knowledge.jsonl`, tracked by git. Your team compounds knowledge together.

## The workflow

Most of the time, you type three commands:

```
/lavra-design "I want users to upload photos for listings"
```

This runs the full planning pipeline as a single command: interactive brainstorm with scope sharpening, structured plan with phased beads, domain-matched research agents, plan revision, and adversarial review. The output is detailed enough that implementation is mechanical.

```
/lavra-work
```

Picks up the approved plan and implements it. Auto-routes between single and multi-bead parallel execution. Includes mandatory review, fix loop, and knowledge curation -- all automatic.

```
/lavra-ship
```

Rebases on main, runs tests, scans for secrets and debug leftovers, creates the PR, closes beads, and pushes the backup. One command to land the plane.

Add `/lavra-qa` between work and ship when building web apps -- it maps changed files to routes and runs browser-based verification with screenshots.

## Who this is for

Anyone using coding agents who wants consistent, high-quality output instead of hoping the agent gets it right this time.

- **Non-technical users:** `/lavra-design "build me X"` handles the brainstorming, planning, and research. `/lavra-work` handles the implementation with built-in quality gates. You get working software without needing to know how to code.
- **Solo developers:** The memory system acts as a second brain. Past decisions, patterns, and gotchas surface automatically when they're relevant.
- **Teams:** Knowledge compounds across contributors. One person's hard-won insight becomes everyone's starting context.

## Install

**Requires:** [beads CLI](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads), `jq`, `sqlite3`

```bash
npx @lavralabs/lavra@latest
```

Or manual:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roberto-mello/lavra.git
cd lavra
./install.sh               # Claude Code (default)
./install.sh --opencode    # OpenCode
./install.sh --gemini      # Gemini CLI
./install.sh --cortex      # Cortex Code
```

<details>
<summary><strong>All commands</strong></summary>

**Pipeline (4):** `/lavra-design`, `/lavra-work`, `/lavra-qa`, `/lavra-ship`

**Supporting (9):** `/lavra-quick` (fast path with escalation), `/lavra-learn` (knowledge curation), `/lavra-recall` (mid-session search), `/lavra-checkpoint` (save progress), `/lavra-retro` (weekly analytics), `/lavra-import`, `/lavra-triage`, `/changelog`, `/test-browser`

**Power-user (6):** `/lavra-plan`, `/lavra-research`, `/lavra-eng-review`, `/lavra-review` (15 specialized review agents), `/lavra-work-ralph` (autonomous retry), `/lavra-work-teams` (persistent workers)

**30 specialized agents** across review, research, design, workflow, and docs. Each runs at the right model tier to keep costs 60-70% lower than running everything on Opus.

See [docs/CATALOG.md](docs/CATALOG.md) for the full listing.

## How knowledge compounds

```
brainstorm  --DECISION-->  design
design      <--LEARNED/PATTERN--  auto-recall from prior work
research    --FACT/INVESTIGATION-->  plan revision
work        --LEARNED (inline)-->  mandatory knowledge gate
review      --LEARNED-->  issues become future recall
retro       synthesizes patterns, surfaces gaps
```

Six knowledge types (LEARNED, DECISION, FACT, PATTERN, INVESTIGATION, DEVIATION) are captured inline during work and stored in `.lavra/memory/knowledge.jsonl`. At session start, relevant entries are recalled automatically based on your current beads and git branch. The system gets smarter over time -- not just for you, but for your whole team.

### Configuration

**`.lavra/config/lavra.json`** can be created manually or by the `/lavra-setup` command.
It allows users to toggle workflow phases, planning and execution behavior.

The trade-off is between more research and review happening in subagents for better quality,
at the expense of more tokens. If you want to reduce token usage, turn off
some of these.

```jsonc
{
  "workflow": {
    // /lavra-design: run or skip 5 research subagents
    "research": true,
    // /lavra-design: run or skip engineering review with 4 subagents
    "plan_review": true,
    // use or skip goal-verifier agent to verify completion criteria in /lavra-work and /lavra-ship
    "goal_verification": true,
    // full (default) runs /lavra-review on all changes
    // "targeted" runs only on beads meeting risk criteria (hooks, API routes, auth, external services)
    "review_scope": "targeted",
    // "full" (default) means full test criteria in child beads.
    // "targeted" tests only when hooks, API routes, complex logic are involved
    "testing_scope": "targeted"
  },
  "execution": {
    "max_parallel_agents": 3,     // max subagents running at once
    "commit_granularity": "task"  // "task" (atomic, default) or "wave" (legacy)
  },
  "model_profile": "balanced"     // "balanced" (default) or "quality" (opus for review/verification agents)
}
```

**`/lavra-setup`**: run this to generate a codebase profile (stack, architecture, conventions) that informs planning.
