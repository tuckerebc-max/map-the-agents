# Harness Engineering: From Claude Code Internals to AI Coding Best Practices

This repository publishes a technical book about Harness Engineering through the lens of Claude Code. The material is derived from the publicly distributed Claude Code `v2.1.88` package and source map reconstruction, then turned into a book focused on reusable engineering patterns rather than product marketing or unofficial feature rumors.

The English edition is currently a scaffolded preview with the full table of contents, cover, and placeholder chapter pages. The Chinese edition remains the canonical version while the English translation is added chapter by chapter.
