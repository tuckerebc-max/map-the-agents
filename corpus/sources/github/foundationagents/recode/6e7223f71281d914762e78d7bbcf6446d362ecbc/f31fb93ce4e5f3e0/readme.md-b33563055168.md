ReCode introduces recursive code generation for LLM agents, unifying plan and action into a single representation. By treating high-level plans as placeholder functions that recursively decompose into executable primitives, it achieves universal granularity control and dynamically adapts from strategic thinking to concrete actions. This repository hosts the reference implementation used in the paper, along with environment wrappers and experiment tooling.

## Core Idea

ReCode adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, decomposing complex tasks into executable code fragments:

1. **Tree-structured code**: Organizes partial programs in a tree where each node captures one sub-task and records its execution trace.
2. **Recursive expansion**: Placeholder functions are expanded by the LLM into more specific calls or smaller subroutines using environment-specific prompts and few-shots.
3. **Dynamic execution loop**: Each node is executed immediately; fresh observations decide whether to expand further, retry, or finish.
4. **Shared executor state**: A constrained Python executor maintains environment variables, validates code blocks, and exposes the toolset available to the agent.

## Repository Layout

- `run.py` – CLI entry point that instantiates agents/envs, manages concurrency, and writes run summaries.
- `agents/recode/` – ReCode agent implementation, prompt templates, and utility helpers.
- `envs/` – Environment wrappers and assets for `alfworld`, `webshop`, and `sciworld`.
- `configs/` – LLM profile templates and (expected) pricing metadata used by the async client.
- `utils/` – Shared components: async OpenAI wrapper, constrained executor, logging helpers, error types.
- `figures/` – Paper figures used throughout this README.

## Experiments

To evaluate the effectiveness of ReCode, we divide our experiments into the inference part and the training part.

1. **Inference Result**: we compare against several mainstream paradigm (ReAct, CodeAct) and some of the work focused on improving LLM-based agent planning (AdaPlanner and ADaPT). ReCode achieved significant performance improvements across all three environments, with an average score of 60.8, surpassing the best baseline method by 10.5 (relative 20.9%). _With our tests, ReCode can achieve a perfect **100** score in ALFWorld under `claude-4-sonnet`._

</p>

2. **Training Result**: we conduct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on ReCode, ReAct and CodeAct with `Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct`. ReCode+SFT delivers an impressive average performance of 70.4% across all environments, outperforming both ReAct+SFT (67.6%) and CodeAct+SFT (55.8%), highlighting its exceptional data efficiency.

## Quick Start

To run ReCode, we need a conda environment. The python version should be 3.10 or newer.

Then, it is necessary to configure dependencies for three environments (it has not been confirmed whether conflicts will arise in the same environment), and we suggest configuring them in three separate environments.

```bash
conda create -n recode-envname python=3.10 # Replace "envname" with the your environment name.
conda activate recode-envname
```

---

### ALFWorld
- Follow the [ALFWorld instructions](https://github.com/alfworld/alfworld).
- Set `ALFWORLD_DATA` to the dataset root or edit `envs/alfworld/base_config.yaml` to point to your local paths:

  ```bash
  export ALFWORLD_DATA=/path/to/alfworld
  ```

### ScienceWorld
- Follow the instruciton from the [ScienceWorld repository](https://github.com/allenai/ScienceWorld).

### WebShop
Thanks to [ETO ](https://github.com/Yifan-Song793/ETO) for providing a convenient script to configure WebShop environment.

```bash
cd envs/webshop
pip install -e .
conda install -y -c conda-forge openjdk=11
pip install "en_core_web_lg @ https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_lg-3.6.0/en_core_web_lg-3.6.0-py3-none-any.whl"
```

Run the provided helper to fetch the goal set and pre-built search index:

```bash
# The current path is "envs/webshop"
bash setup.sh
```

---

Install some other dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # Here may not be complete, please contact me promptly if you encounter any problems
```

Ensure `configs/profiles.yaml` points to a valid API credential (copy `configs/profiles_example.yaml` if you need a template), then run a short dry run in any enabled environment:
```bash
python run.py -a recode -e alfworld -n 1 --split test --profile default
```
Replace `alfworld` with `webshop` or `sciworld` once their assets are available. Logs are written to `logs/<run_id>/`, and the console prints a condensed summary for quick diagnostics.

## Configure LLM Access

- `configs/profiles.yaml` contains named profiles. The `run.py --profile` flag selects which profile to forward to `AsyncLLM`. Example:

  ```yaml
  models:
    default:
      api_key: "sk-your_api_key"
      base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
      model: "gpt-4o-mini"
      temperature: 0.0
      track_costs: true
    gpt-4o:
      api_key: "sk-your_other_key"
      base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
      model: "gpt-4o"
      temperature: 0.7
      max_tokens: 512
  ```

- Cost tracking loads `configs/prices.json`. If you do not want to record costs, set `track_costs: false` for the profile.
- As a fallback, you can omit the file and set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment; the default profile will then use it.
- A ready-to-edit template lives at `configs/profiles_example.yaml`; copy it to `configs/profiles.yaml` if you're starting from scratch:
  ```bash
  cp configs/profiles_example.yaml configs/profiles.yaml
  ```

## Running ReCode

`run.py` is the canonical entry point. It resolves agent/environment aliases, manages concurrency, streams logs, and emits a structured summary.

```bash
# ALFWorld, single instance
python run.py -a recode -e alfworld -n 1 --split test --profile default

# WebShop, 3 test goals, allow deeper recursion
python run.py -a recode -e webshop -n 3 --split test --profile default --max-depth 12

# ScienceWorld, run 5 instances with 2-way concurrency
python run.py -a recode -e sciworld -n 5 -c 2 --profile gpt-4o
```

Key CLI flags:
- `-a / --agent` – class path or alias (`recode` resolves to `agents.recode.agent.ReCodeAgent`).
- `-e / --env` – environment class or alias (`alfworld`, `webshop`, `sciworld`).
- `-n / --instances` – number of evaluation episodes.
- `-c / --concurrent` – max concurrent episodes (rich progress UI automatically adapts).
- `--split`, `--seed`, `--max-depth`, `--profile` – forwarded to both agent and environment.
- `-C / --config` – YAML file whose keys override CLI flags; useful for complex sweeps.

Example YAML (`configs/example.yaml`):

```yaml
agent: recode
env: alfworld
instances: 10
concurrent: 2
profile: gpt-4o
split: test
task_types: ["put", "clean"] # For ALFWorld
max_depth: 12
max_retry: 4
```

Run it with:

```bash
python run.py -C configs/example.yaml
```

## Logging & Results

- Each run creates `logs/<run_id>/` with:
  - `running_logs/run.log` – aggregated stream of agent + environment logs.
  - `running_logs/instance_<id>.log` – per-instance traces (when multiple instances are launched).
  - `<results.json>` – structured summary written by `write_summary`, containing per-instance metrics and aggregated statistics (overall + per task type).
- The console prints a condensed summary (success rate, standard metrics, by-task breakdown) after completion.

## Extending to New Environments

1. **Implement the `Env` interface** under `envs/<your_env>/env.py`. Use `base.environment.Env` as the contract: implement `reset`, `_run`, `is_done`, `is_success`, and `report`. Return `{"observations": [...], "env_name": <name>, "env": self}` from `reset`.
2. **Expose prompts and guidance** in `agents/recode/resources/`:
   - `prompts/<env_name>/actions.txt` – concise description of valid `run("...")` calls/tools.
   - `fewshots/<env_name>/` – one or more `.txt` examples showing thought→execute patterns.
   - If your environment has task types, update `agents/recode/agent.py::_load_resources` and `agents/recode/utils.parse_raw_observation` to parse initial observations correctly.
3. **Register aliases** by adding your class to `ENV_ALIASES` in `run.py` (optional but convenient) and, if needed, plan-specific logic in the agent utilities.
4. Optionally add setup scripts (similar to `envs/webshop/setup.sh`) to document dataset fetching.

## Programmatic Use

You can embed the agent directly inside your own loop by reusing the provided utilities:

```python
import asyncio

from agents.recode.agent import ReCodeAgent
from envs.alfworld.env import AlfworldEnv

async def solve_once():
    config = {"split": "test", "task_types": ["put"], "max_depth": 10}
    env = AlfworldEnv(logger=None)
    agent = ReCodeAgent()
    init_info = env.reset(config)
    agent.reset(config, init_info)

    observations = init_info["observations"]
    while not env.is_done():
        actions = await agent.act(observations)
        observations = await env.run(actions)

    print(env.report())
    await env.close()

asyncio.run(solve_once())
```

The same pattern works for any `Env` implementation; be sure to pass a logger if you need file-backed traces.
