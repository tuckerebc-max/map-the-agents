## Why Séance?

Séance is a GTK4 terminal multiplexer for Linux. It auto-detects [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono), [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), and [Antigravity CLI](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/getting-started) sessions running inside it and tracks their status (working, waiting for permission, idle) live in the sidebar. Permission requests and task completions are surfaced as desktop notifications with unread tracking. No manual dotfile edits: open an agent in a pane to track it.

### Linux-native, not Electron

GTK4 and libadwaita, so it integrates with the rest of GNOME and with tiling WM setups. X11 and Wayland. Blur and transparency on both. GPU-accelerated terminal rendering via [libghostty](https://ghostty.org) (Ghostty used as a library).

### Scrolling layout

Panes are arranged in a horizontal strip that you scroll through, borrowing the layout model from [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri). Fits long, linear agent sessions better than a tiling grid, and lines up naturally with scrolling tiling WMs.

### Agent-agnostic

Claude Code, Codex, Pi, OpenCode, and Antigravity CLI are auto-tracked out of the box. Agents that do not expose lifecycle events still get all the plain multiplexer features.

Codex requires a one-time review of Séance's hooks via `/hooks`. Approval persists
across panes and restarts; changes to the hook definitions require a new review.
Séance adds its hooks for the current invocation and keeps your Codex home,
existing hooks, authentication, and history in place.

OpenCode's bundled plugin is added for each local launch through its inline
configuration. Existing configuration, plugins, authentication, and history stay
in place. Resumed sessions and subagents contribute to the pane's status;
permission requests and questions show **Needs input** until answered.
Remote `opencode attach` sessions and `--pure` launches are not tracked.
Disable tracking in **Settings → Integrations → OpenCode Integration**, or set
`opencode-hooks = false` under `[behavior]` in Séance's configuration, then open a new pane.

Antigravity CLI (`agy`) is tracked through its [status-line callback](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/statusline/).
On first launch inside Séance, the wrapper adds the callback to
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`, keeping an original backup at
`settings.json.seance-backup`. Existing settings and custom status-line output
are preserved; the default status line stays visible. The callback is inert
outside tracked launches and resolves Séance through the current wrapper, so it
also works with AppImages.

Actual tool confirmation dialogs show **Needs input** and trigger one notification
per transition. Returning to idle triggers **Antigravity is idle**, including
after cancellation or denial; this does not assert that the task succeeded.
Reported background tasks keep the pane working until they finish. Tracking is
limited to the active TUI's reported state: headless/print mode, unreported
background permission requests, and non-tool input dialogs are not covered.
An explicitly disabled status-line callback is respected and disables tracking.
Disable the integration in **Settings → Integrations → Antigravity CLI Integration**,
or set `antigravity-hooks = false` under `[behavior]`, then open a new pane.

### Scriptable

Every action is available through `seance ctl`, which talks to the running instance over a Unix domain socket. Scripts and AI agents can create workspaces, open panes, send input, read terminal output, and query the full session hierarchy. All commands support JSON output.

A bundled [skill file](skills/seance-skill.md) provides AI agents with a complete reference for the `seance ctl` API, so they can use the multiplexer on their own.

### And also

Workspaces, session persistence across restarts, tabs within columns, a command palette, focus-follows-mouse, and no telemetry. Press **F11** to toggle fullscreen, or choose **Toggle Fullscreen** in the command palette. The header bar hides in fullscreen and returns when you exit.

## Installation

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
yay -S seance
```

### Nix (flake)

To run it directly without installing:

```bash
nix run "git+https://github.com/no1msd/seance?submodules=1"
```

To install it persistently into your profile:

```bash
nix profile install "git+https://github.com/no1msd/seance?submodules=1"
```

Both commands compile from source on the first run and cache the result in
the Nix store.

> **Non-NixOS users:** EGL won't initialize without a GL wrapper.
> On Intel/AMD use [`nixGL`](https://github.com/nix-community/nixGL):
>
> ```bash
> nix run --impure github:nix-community/nixGL#nixGLIntel -- \
>   nix run "git+https://github.com/no1msd/seance?submodules=1"
> ```
>
> On Nvidia use [`nix-gl-host`](https://github.com/numtide/nix-gl-host), since
> nixGL's Nvidia wrapper breaks on recent drivers:
>
> ```bash
> nix run github:numtide/nix-gl-host -- \
>   $(nix build --no-link --print-out-paths \
>     "git+https://github.com/no1msd/seance?submodules=1")/bin/seance
> ```

### AppImage

Download the latest `seance-*-x86_64.AppImage` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/no1msd/seance/releases), make it executable, and run it:

```bash
chmod +x seance-*-x86_64.AppImage
./seance-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

Requires `libfuse2` on the host. Uses the host's `libGL`/`libEGL`, so Mesa or proprietary GPU drivers must be installed.

To use `seance ctl` from your shell, move the AppImage onto your `PATH`:

```bash
mv seance-*-x86_64.AppImage ~/.local/bin/seance
```

### Building from source

Requires Zig **0.16.x**, GTK4, libadwaita, OpenGL 4.3+, and Linux (X11 or Wayland).

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/no1msd/seance.git
cd seance
zig build
```

The binary is at `zig-out/bin/seance`.
