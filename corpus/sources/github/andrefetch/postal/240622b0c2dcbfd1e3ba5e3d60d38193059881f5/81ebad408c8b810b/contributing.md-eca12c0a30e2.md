# Contributing

Hey, thanks for wanting to contribute!


## Getting started

Postal is a Python project (3.11+). To get set up locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrefetch/postal.git
cd postal
uv sync
```

You can also install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you prefer pip over uv.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo (or create a branch if you have access).
2. Create a branch for your change, for example `fix/token-usage` or `feat/new-tool`.
3. Make your changes and test them locally.
4. Open a PR against `main` with a clear description of what you changed and why.

Keep PRs focused. Smaller, single-purpose PRs are easier to review and get merged faster.

## UI Component-Based System

Postal uses a component-based UI system where each visual element is a separate, reusable component. This design makes it easier to:

- **Create new UI elements:** Add new components following the existing patterns in `ui/components/`
- **Maintain and test components:** Each component is isolated and can be tested independently
- **Customize the appearance:** Modify individual components without affecting other parts
- **Understand the codebase:** Components are self-contained with clear purposes

### UI Component Structure

All UI components are in the `ui/components/` directory:

- **Base components:** `Gutter`, `Spinner`, `MarkdownStream`
- **UI elements:** `logo.py`, `thinking.py`, `shimmer.py`, `tool_call.py`
- **Interactive elements:** `confirmation.py`, `args_table.py`
- **Container components:** `plan.py`, `memory.py`, `transcript.py`
- **Visual utilities:** `theme/palette.py`, `theme/styles.py`

### Contributing to UI Components

When adding or modifying UI components:

1. **Follow existing patterns:** Look at similar components for examples
2. **Import from the right places:** Components in `ui/components/__init__.py` are the public API
3. **Use the theme system:** Styles are defined in `ui/theme/` and imported where needed
4. **Keep components focused:** Each component should have one clear responsibility
5. **Export if reusable:** Add components to `ui/components/__init__.py` if they might be used elsewhere

### Example Component: A Custom Spinner

```python
from rich.console import Console
from rich.live import Live

class CustomSpinner:
    def __init__(self, console: Console):
        self.console = console
        self.frames = ["⣾ ", "⣷ ", "⣯ ", "⣟ ", "⡿ ", "⢟ ", "⢯ ", "⣯ ", "⣷ "]
        self.current = 0

    def render(self):
        return self.frames[self.current]

    def advance(self):
        self.current = (self.current + 1) % len(self.frames)
```

### Development Tips

- **Run tests locally:** Use `uv sync && uv run pytest` to run the existing test suite
- **Check component imports:** Verify your changes don't break imports in `ui/components/__init__.py`
- **Test visually:** Run Postal with your changes to ensure the UI renders correctly
- **Follow the style guide:** Keep code clean and maintainable
