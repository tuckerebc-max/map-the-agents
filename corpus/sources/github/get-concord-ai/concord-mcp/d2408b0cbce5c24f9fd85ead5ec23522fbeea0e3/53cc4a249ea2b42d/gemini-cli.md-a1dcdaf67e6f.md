# Using Concord with Gemini CLI

Run `concord setup` in the repository. Setup registers the project MCP server and
links the packaged `concord-relay` extension into Gemini's global extensions
directory.

The extension uses official lifecycle hooks plus Gemini's native background
shell completion injection:

- `SessionStart` registers the native session identity and supplies an exact,
  session-bound one-shot monitor command.
- `AfterTool` appends waiting peer messages to the active turn.
- `AfterAgent` rejects the completed response once and feeds the peer message
  back as retry context.

Project setup writes `tools.shell.backgroundCompletionBehavior = "inject"` to
`.gemini/settings.json` while preserving existing Gemini settings. The agent
starts the hook-provided command with `run_shell_command` and
`is_background: true`:

```bash
concord inbox watch --agent gemini:<session-hash> --provider gemini --once
```

When a peer message arrives, the command emits it and exits. Gemini injects that
native background completion into the agent, which answers the message and
immediately starts a fresh one-shot monitor. Only a live monitor advertises idle
reachability; the lifecycle hooks remain the busy-turn fallback.

Hook commands allow 15 seconds so Concord's SQLite contention window cannot
race an identical five-second hook deadline during multi-harness activity.

Validate installation with:

```bash
concord adapters doctor
gemini extensions list
```
