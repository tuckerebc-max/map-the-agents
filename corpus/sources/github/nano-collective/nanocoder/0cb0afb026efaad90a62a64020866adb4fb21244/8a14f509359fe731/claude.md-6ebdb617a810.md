## Project Overview

Nanocoder is a React-based CLI coding agent built with Ink.js that provides local-first AI assistance with multiple provider support (Ollama, OpenRouter, any OpenAI-compatible API).

**Entry point**: `source/cli.tsx` → dynamic import of `App` from `source/app/App.tsx` (re-exported via `source/app/index.ts`). `cli.tsx` has fast paths for `--help`/`--version` (no app import), copilot/codex device-flow login, and a `--plain` non-Ink shell (`source/plain/shell.ts`) for CI / non-TTY environments.

## Architecture

### Core Application Flow

1. **Directory Trust Check** (`useDirectoryTrust`) - First-run security disclaimer for new directories
2. **App Initialization** (`useAppInitialization`) - Creates LLM client, loads MCP servers, loads custom commands
3. **Central State** (`useAppState`) - Single source of truth for 50+ state variables
4. **Chat/Tool Flow** - User input → LLM → tool confirmation → execution → response

### Key Directories

- `source/hooks/` - React hooks: `useAppState` (central state), `useToolHandler`, `useModeHandlers`, `useAppHandlers` (orchestrator), plus `chat-handler/useChatHandler` (LLM interaction, in subdir)
- `source/app/` - `App.tsx` plus app-internal helpers (`utils/app-util.ts`, `utils/conversation-state.ts`, prompt sections, orchestration hooks in `app/hooks/`)
- `source/ai-sdk-client/` - Wrapper over Vercel AI SDK: chat handler, providers, converters, tool helpers, error handling
- `source/tools/` - Built-in tools (file ops, bash, search, web fetch). Registered in `source/tools/tool-manager.ts`; main file editors are `string_replace` and `write_file`
- `source/components/` - Ink UI components
- `source/config/` - Configuration loading and preferences
- `source/commands/` - Built-in slash commands (`/model`, `/provider`, `/clear`, etc.)
- `source/custom-commands/` - User-defined markdown commands from `.nanocoder/commands/`
- `source/mcp/` - Model Context Protocol server integration
- `source/tool-calling/` - XML/text tool-call parsers for the fallback path (non-native-tool models)
- `source/services/` - Checkpoint manager, bash executor, file snapshots, lifecycle hooks (user shell commands run at fixed points in the agent loop)
- `source/usage/` - Token/cost usage: breakdown calculator, per-response usage + cost builder (provider-reported tokens priced via models.dev), compact formatters for the per-response indicator, session usage storage
- `source/session/` - Chat session persistence (autosave / resume)
- `source/schedule/` - Cron-based scheduled agent runs (`scheduler` mode)
- `source/subagents/` - Subagent executor (delegated agent runs)
- `source/auth/` - Copilot / Codex device-flow login
- `source/lsp/` - Language server client integration
- `source/wizards/` - Interactive setup flows (config, MCP, providers)
- `source/plain/` - Non-Ink CLI shell used by `--plain`
- `source/skills/` - Unified skill primitive: loaders (bundle + flat-dir adapter), manifest parser, frontmatter `subscribe:` parser, registrar that fans members into the existing command / subagent / tool registries, dispatcher for triggered runs
- `source/events/` - Event router, file watcher source (chokidar), cron source (croner), backpressure (per-subscription concurrency cap + 500ms trailing debounce on `file.changed`)
- `source/daemon/` - Per-project daemon process: lockfile, Unix-socket IPC server / TUI client, CLI surface (`nanocoder daemon <start|stop|status|logs>`), launchd plist + systemd user unit installers

### State Management Pattern

All state lives in `source/hooks/useAppState.tsx`. Other hooks (`useChatHandler`, `useToolHandler`, `useModeHandlers`) receive state and setters from it. `source/app/App.tsx` orchestrates them via `useAppHandlers`. Global `source/utils/message-queue.tsx` lets deep components push chat messages without prop-drilling.

### Tool System

Tools are registered in `source/tools/tool-manager.ts` with:
- **handler**: Executes the tool
- **nativeTool**: AI SDK tool definition
- **formatter**: Formats output for display
- **validator**: Pre-execution validation (optional)

File editing uses a content-based approach:
- `string_replace`: Primary edit tool — replaces exact content
- `write_file`: Whole file overwrites

Two execution paths exist: native tool calling (preferred, via AI SDK) and an XML fallback for models that don't support tools. `LLMChatResponse.toolsDisabled` signals which path produced the response. The conversation loop runs `parseToolCalls()` (in `source/tool-calling/`) whenever the response has no native tool calls — always on the fallback path, and on the native path too, since models marketed as native-tool-capable sometimes regress to emitting tool-call text. Malformed text there feeds the self-correction retry loop capped by `nanocoder.retries.maxMalformedRetries`.

### Command System

Slash commands live in `source/commands/` and are lazy-loaded via `source/commands/lazy-registry.ts`. To add a new command: create the command file exporting a `Command` object (name, description, handler), then add an entry to `lazyCommands` in the registry. Commands return React elements for Ink rendering. Some commands (clear, model, provider, etc.) need app state and are intercepted as "special commands" in `source/app/utils/app-util.ts`.

A command that does slow work before returning (LLM round-trip, network) should declare `progressLabel`. `handleBuiltInCommand` then holds a `CommandProgress` spinner in the live slot for the duration, so the UI is not silent while the handler runs. Set it on both the module's `Command` object and its `lazyCommands` entry - the spinner has to render before `load()` resolves, so it cannot be read off the lazily-imported module.

### Custom Tools

File-based tools live in `source/custom-tools/`. `CustomToolLoader` discovers `.md` files in `.nanocoder/tools/` (project) and `~/.config/nanocoder/tools/` (personal, via `getConfigPath()`); project tools shadow personal ones by `name`. Each file's YAML frontmatter declares the schema; `schema-builder.ts` synthesizes both the AI SDK `inputSchema` and a `ToolValidator`. `template.ts` renders the script body with `{{ name }}` and `{{# section }}` placeholders, shell-quoting all substitutions. `handler.ts` spawns the shell with timeout + env/cwd resolution. `build-tool.ts` glues everything into a `ToolEntry`, then `ToolManager.initializeCustomTools()` registers them into the same registry as built-ins and MCP tools — downstream code (`/tools`, subagents, mode filtering) sees them through the unified registry. Mode policy for custom tools lives in `ToolManager.getAvailableToolNames`: plan mode requires `approval=never && read_only=true`, scheduler mode requires `approval=never`.

### Configuration Resolution Order

1. `agents.config.json` in working directory (project-level)
2. Platform config dir: `~/.config/nanocoder/agents.config.json` (Linux), `~/Library/Preferences/nanocoder/` (macOS)
3. `~/.agents.config.json` (legacy fallback)

If `NANOCODER_CONFIG_DIR` is set, the platform/legacy lookups are skipped and that directory is used directly.

Environment variable substitution in config values: `$VAR`, `${VAR}`, `${VAR:-default}`

### LLM Client Architecture

`source/client-factory.ts` creates clients via `createLLMClient(provider?)`. Uses Vercel AI SDK (`ai` v6) with `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` for any OpenAI-compatible API, plus dedicated `@ai-sdk/anthropic` and `@ai-sdk/google` providers. The wrapper logic (streaming, tool calls, error handling, prepareStep, retries) lives in `source/ai-sdk-client/`.

### Skills

A **skill** is the unit of extension. Two ergonomic forms over one primitive:

- **Single-file**: a `.md` in `.nanocoder/commands|agents|tools/`. Filename is the skill name. Optional `subscribe:` block in frontmatter declares event triggers. Backwards-compatible with the legacy flat dirs.
- **Bundle**: a directory under `.nanocoder/skills/<name>/` containing `skill.yaml` plus optional `commands/`, `agents/`, `tools/` subdirs. Multi-piece features (e.g. a `pr-reviewer` skill with a subagent + tool + command) live in a bundle.

Loaders (`source/skills/bundle-loader.ts`, `source/skills/flat-loader.ts`) read project / personal / built-in locations in priority order. The **registrar** (`source/skills/registrar.ts`) fans each skill's members into the existing `CustomCommandLoader`, `SubagentLoader`, and `ToolManager.registry` - downstream consumers (`/tools`, agent tool, mode filters) keep using their familiar registries.

Bundle tools default to `tools_visibility: scoped`: hidden from the global tool list, visible only to the bundle's own subagent. Single-file tools default to `global`.

**Event triggers**: subscriptions on a member's frontmatter or a manifest's `subscribe:` block. The **per-project daemon** (`source/daemon/`, started by `nanocoder daemon start`) owns file-watch and cron sources. The interactive TUI never starts event sources. `confirm: true` on a subscription dispatches the triggered run in `plan` mode instead of `headless`.

## Code Style

- **TypeScript strict mode** with `@/*` path alias mapping to `source/*`
- **Biome** for formatting (tabs, single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas)
- **Key lint rules**: `useExhaustiveDependencies: error`, `noUnusedVariables: error`, `noUnusedImports: error`
- **React 19** with Ink.js for CLI rendering

## Testing

- **Framework**: AVA with tsx loader
- **Location**: `source/**/*.spec.ts` files alongside source
- **Serial execution**: Tests run one at a time
- **Run single test**: `pnpm run test:ava source/path/to/file.spec.ts`

## Development Modes

Four user-facing modes (toggle with Shift+Tab during chat):
- **normal**: Confirm each tool before execution
- **auto-accept**: Automatically execute most tools (bash and destructive git still prompt)
- **yolo**: Automatically execute every tool without exception
- **plan**: Show tool calls but don't execute

There is also an internal **headless** mode used by the daemon for every triggered skill run (file.changed, schedule.cron, future kinds). Same posture as the legacy `scheduler` mode it supersedes: no `ask_user`, no foreground confirmations. Per-subscription `confirm: true` opts into `plan` mode instead.
