> **An AI coding agent that lives in your terminal.**

FuXi is a fast, self-contained **terminal AI coding agent** — read code, edit
files, run commands, and drive tools from a rich TUI, with cost-aware routing
across LLM providers and automatic failover. Built in Go, it ships as one
static binary with no runtime dependencies. Think of it as a provider-agnostic
alternative to Claude Code: bring any OpenAI-compatible model and get an
agentic Think → Act → Verify loop on top of it.

**Terminal-first** · **Provider-agnostic** · **Bring your own key** · **MCP client** · **Self-updating**

### What FuXi does

Its agentic **Think → Act → Verify** loop and intelligent routing let any
OpenAPI-compatible model perform above its raw benchmark — verified against
another coding agent on a reproducible task set (see
[benchmark](benchmark/REPORT.md)).

## Highlights

**The model is the engine. FuXi is the vehicle.** A model alone answers
questions; FuXi turns it into a worker — reasoning, acting on your real
codebase, verifying results, and doing it affordably and under your control.

- **50+ built-in tools** — file read/write/edit, shell (`bash` / PowerShell),
  ripgrep search, web fetch, LSP diagnostics, Jupyter, browser use, background
  tasks, and parallel sub-agents — all in one binary.
- **Safety guardrails** — shell commands pass an AST safety classifier before
  execution; fine-grained permissions and audit logging keep autonomous work
  under your control.
- **Durable sessions & memory** — transcripts persist to disk; checkpoints let
  you resume, roll back, or fork; idle "dreaming" consolidates memory across
  sessions; long conversations auto-compact to save tokens.
- **Bring your own key, or log in** — any provider API key (OpenAPI-compatible,
  Gemini, Bedrock/Vertex), or sign in with FuXi OAuth.
- **Extensible** — MCP client, hooks, skills, plugins, and slash commands, all
  hot-reloadable.
- **Free forever** — one static binary, no runtime dependencies, no license
  cost for individuals, teams, or enterprises.
- **Self-updating** — a background version check and one-command `fuxi update`,
  with checksum verification before it replaces the running binary.

## How FuXi compares

FuXi is a terminal-first AI coding agent designed to be provider-agnostic.
Feature availability reflects each product's publicly documented positioning
as of mid-2026; details evolve quickly, so treat it as an orientation.

### Measured head-to-head

![FuXi vs Claude Code head-to-head](docs/headtohead.png)

Both systems were driven through their own native clients, on identical
baselines and the same objective scorer (pytest + coverage), across 15 micro
dimensions and 4 large-project dimensions. Full methodology, raw results,
environment versions, exact commands, and known limitations are in
[`benchmark/REPORT.md`](benchmark/REPORT.md) so you can verify or re-run it.

> An honest caveat: this is a small, self-run task set — not a third-party
> benchmark — and it measures the *agent loop*, not raw model scores. Treat it
> as a data point, not a headline.

---

## Evaluation & benchmarks

FuXi is built to be measured honestly. It currently ships without a published
score on third-party benchmarks (e.g. SWE-bench, Terminal-Bench, or the Aider
polyglot benchmark). We prefer reproducible, self-verifiable evaluation over
headline numbers — so here is how to evaluate FuXi yourself, on your own work.

**A practical evaluation checklist**

1. **Install & self-check** — after installing, run `fuxi doctor` to verify your
   environment (config, API key, git, ripgrep) and `fuxi verify` to confirm the
   provider connection. A clean bill here is the baseline.
2. **Reproduce a real task** — pick a failing test in one of your own projects
   and let FuXi fix it; then extend the module and re-run the suite (the demo
   above shows exactly this flow). Repeat across a handful of daily tasks:
   code review, commits, PRs, refactors.
3. **Compare side by side** — run the identical task, model, and context through
   another tool and compare: correctness, tool coverage, cost, and iteration
   time. Judging on the same ground keeps the comparison fair.

FuXi exposes everything needed for that comparison — `/cost`, `/usage`,
`/context`, and `/status` inside the TUI — and ships its own environment
self-check (`fuxi doctor`). Benchmarks that are published in the future will
be linked from this section.

## Install

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://downloads.fuxicode.com/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://downloads.fuxicode.com/bootstrap.ps1 | iex
```

### Windows (CMD)

```bat
curl -fsSL https://downloads.fuxicode.com/install.cmd -o "%TEMP%\fuxi-install.cmd" && "%TEMP%\fuxi-install.cmd"
```

All three install to `~/.local/bin` (`%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` on Windows) and add
it to your **user** `PATH` if it isn't there already. Running the same command again
later upgrades an existing install in place — it's the same command for install and
upgrade.

By default they install the latest version; pin a specific one with an argument, e.g.
`./bootstrap.sh 0.1.2` or `./bootstrap.ps1 0.1.2`.

### Verify the install

```bash
fuxi --version
fuxi doctor      # environment sanity checks (config, API key, git, ripgrep, ...)
```

### Uninstall

```bash
# macOS / Linux
rm -f "$HOME/.local/bin/fuxi"
rm -rf "$HOME/.fuxi"   # optional: also drop config/state

# Windows (PowerShell)
Remove-Item -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin\fuxi.exe"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.fuxi"   # optional
```

## Getting started

Launch the TUI:

```bash
fuxi
```

On first run FuXi creates its config under `~/.fuxi/`. You need a model to talk to,
via one of two paths:

1. **Sign in** — `fuxi login` opens a browser to authenticate with your FuXi
   account, which provisions FuXi-managed models automatically. No API key needed.
2. **Bring your own key** — set a provider API key via environment variable, or
   write `~/.fuxi/config.yaml` directly (`fuxi init` generates a starter template,
   auto-detecting a provider from whatever env vars are already set):

   ```yaml
   provider: openapi
   base_url: https://your-endpoint/v1
   api_key: <your-key>       # or export FUXI_API_KEY instead
   model: your-model
   ```

   Managing several providers/models instead of one? Use the layered schema — a
   `providers:` catalog plus a `model:` selection layer:

   ```yaml
   providers:
     custom:
       type: openapi
       base_url: https://your-endpoint/v1
       api_key: <your-key>
       models:
         - id: your-model-id
   model:
     active: { provider: custom, id: your-model-id }
   ```

   The layered schema supports multiple providers and per-model settings.

   Or run `fuxi wizard` for an interactive setup flow (pick a provider, enter the
   base URL/key, choose a model, test the connection).

Once a model is configured, pick it any time with `/model`, and manage the rest of
your settings with `/config` — everything (permissions, hooks, skills, plugins) is
driven from inside the TUI via slash commands.

**Keyboard & input:** `/` then Enter opens the command browser · `Tab`
autocompletes a slash command · `Ctrl+R` searches prompt history · `Ctrl+V` or
terminal paste pastes directly into the input · bracketed paste handles large
pastes. The full shortcut reference is in
[docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

### Updating

FuXi checks for new versions in the background and prints a one-line notice when
one is available. Update in place with:

```bash
fuxi update            # latest
fuxi update 0.1.2      # a specific version
```

`fuxi update` downloads the target build, verifies its SHA-256 against the
published manifest, and atomically replaces the running binary — it never leaves
you with a partially-installed version. Suppress the background check with
`--no-update-notifier` or `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1`.

### Configuration

- **Config directory:** `~/.fuxi/` (override with `FUXI_CONFIG_DIR`).
- **Config file:** `~/.fuxi/config.yaml` — provider, model, thinking/effort,
  routing preferences, and per-endpoint overrides. Changes hot-reload while
  FuXi is running. `fuxi init` generates a starter template, and `/config`
  manages settings from inside the TUI.
- **Precedence:** environment variables > `config.yaml` > built-in defaults.
- **Project settings:** a checked-in project settings file (permissions, hooks)
  is honored per-project.
- **Plugins:** first-party marketplace at `fuxicode.com/plugins`.

Key environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `FUXI_BASE_URL` / `FUXI_API_KEY` / `FUXI_MODEL` | OpenAPI-compatible provider config |
| `FUXI_THINKING_MODE` / `FUXI_THINKING_EFFORT` | `auto\|enabled\|disabled` / `low\|medium\|high\|max` |
| `FUXI_CONFIG_DIR` | Override the config directory (default `~/.fuxi`) |
| `FUXI_DEBUG` | Set to `1` to enable debug logging |
| `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER` | Set to `1` to suppress the background update-check notice |
| `FUXI_TEMPERATURE` / `FUXI_TOP_P` / `FUXI_SEED` | Sampling controls |

See [`docs/environment.md`](docs/environment.md) for the full
environment-variable reference — including bridge/remote control, sandbox
limits, and MCP resource caps.
