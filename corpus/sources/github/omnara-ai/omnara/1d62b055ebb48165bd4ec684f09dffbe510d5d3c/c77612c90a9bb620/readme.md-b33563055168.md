# Omnara

**The API for production-grade agents.**

Omnara is an open source platform for running managed agents. It handles
execution and state while you choose the models, tools, machines, and how users
interact with each agent.

## Who it is for

- **Developers.** Build agents for internal use or customer-facing products with
  the API. Your application controls who can use each agent, what input it
  receives, and how its output reaches users. Omnara handles execution and state
  in between.
- **Teams.** Interact with agents directly through Omnara's dashboard or
  first-party Slack connector.

## Getting Started

1. Create your agent
```yaml agent.yaml
instruction: |
  You are a coding agent running gpt-5.6-sol. Use the tools
  you have available to solve coding problems for the user.
model:
  provider_config: omnara-openrouter
  name: openai/gpt-5.6-sol
# ...
# add more tools, sandboxes, mcps
```

2. Upload your agent profile
```bash
$ npx omnara login
$ npx omnara profiles create --name agent --file agent.yaml
id                  aprf_aej3...
name                agent
[...]
```

3. Launch the agent from the profile and chat with it

```bash
$ npx omnara agents launch --profile $AGENT_PROFILE_ID --file agent.yaml
$ open https://app.omnara.com/projects/[$PROJECT_ID]/agents/[$AGENT_ID]
```

## Features

- <ins><strong>Durable agents</strong></ins>. Agent state is committed
  atomically to Postgres. Agents recover automatically from crashes, restarts,
  and temporary machine disconnects.
- <ins><strong>Machines</strong></ins>. Use sandboxes from Blaxel, Daytona, Modal,
  or Unikraft (more coming soon), or connect your own laptop or VM. An agent
  can run with no machines or use several at once. These can be sandboxes, your own
  machines, or both. You can add or remove machines while the agent is running.
- <ins><strong>Models</strong></ins>. Bring your own API keys and use any model
  exposed through a compatible endpoint, including OpenRouter, LiteLLM, and
  Ollama. Omnara supports OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Chat Completions, and
  Anthropic Messages, with more API formats coming soon.
- <ins><strong>Tools</strong></ins>. Use built-in tools, custom tools, skills,
  and HTTP MCP servers.
- <ins><strong>RBAC</strong></ins>. Assign organization and project roles to
  users and API keys. Separate who can manage access, configure agents, operate
  them, or only view them.
- <ins><strong>Cloud or self-hosted</strong></ins>. Use Omnara Cloud or run it
  yourself under Apache 2.0.
  - <ins><strong>Queryable state</strong></ins>. Self-hosted deployments can
    query agent history directly in Postgres for analytics, evals, prompt
    analysis, and training datasets.
- <ins><string>CLI and SDK</strong></ins>. Use Omnara programmatically via the CLI, Typescript CLI, or REST API.

## Get started

### Omnara Cloud

Sign up at [app.omnara.com](https://app.omnara.com), add a model provider,
define an agent profile, and launch it from the console, Slack, or API.

See the [quickstart](https://docs.omnara.com/quickstart) for the complete flow.

### Self-host

#### Requirements

- Docker with Compose

#### Run published images

```sh
git clone https://github.com/omnara-ai/omnara.git
cd omnara
docker compose -f compose.yaml --profile app up -d
```

#### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/omnara-ai/omnara.git
cd omnara
docker compose --profile app up -d --build
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Local authentication email
is written to `docker compose logs api`, so you can complete signup without
configuring an email provider.

Add a model provider credential in the console, create an agent profile, and
launch an agent.

Local development uses intentionally insecure defaults. Do not use those
defaults in a deployed environment. Follow the
[self-hosting guide](https://docs.omnara.com/self-hosting/deployment) and
[configuration reference](https://docs.omnara.com/self-hosting/configuration)
for production setup.

## API

The API is defined in [`api/openapi/openapi.yaml`](api/openapi/openapi.yaml) and
served under `/api/v1`. See the
[API overview](https://docs.omnara.com/api/overview).

## Development

Source development requires the Go version declared in [`go.mod`](go.mod),
Node.js 24 or newer with Corepack, and Docker with Compose.

Run the fast repository gate.

```sh
make verify
```

To include React Doctor against the current branch changes, run
`make web-check-all`.

Run database-backed integration tests.

```sh
make test-integration
```

Run deterministic service end-to-end tests.

```sh
make test-service-e2e
```

Provider-backed live tests are available through the `make test-live-*` targets
and require the corresponding credentials.

request expectations.
