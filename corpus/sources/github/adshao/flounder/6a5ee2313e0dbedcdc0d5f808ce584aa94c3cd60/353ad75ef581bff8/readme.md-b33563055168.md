Flounder turns modern coding agents into an end-to-end security audit system. Give it a public-source or authorized target boundary - a repository, source tree, package, deployed clue, or prior run - and the agent can prepare the workspace, read the code and supporting material, map the attack surface, dig into promising regions, construct exploit paths, run local proof tests, and then reproduce confirmed findings against real-world ground truth.

The important distinction is that Flounder is not a scanner for one stack, a checklist runner, or a set of hand-written bug rules. It is a thin white-hat audit workflow around the model: the model decides how to reason about the target, while Flounder supplies the sandbox, command policy, durable state, execution gates, daemon control plane, and reporting needed to make that reasoning usable.

## Use It With An Agent

Install the skill once from GitHub, even when you do not have the source
checkout locally:

```bash
npx skills add adshao/flounder --skill flounder -g -a codex -a claude-code
```

If you are already in a local checkout, install the checked-out copy instead:

```bash
npx skills add . --skill flounder -g -a codex -a claude-code
```

Then ask Codex, Claude Code, or another skills-aware agent naturally:

```text
Audit this repository with Flounder.
```

The installed skill should trigger from requests about Flounder audits, public-source or authorized source review, smart-contract or ZK audit work, daemon/provider setup, verifying suspected findings, confirming real findings, or collecting execution-backed bug reports. The source of truth is [skills/flounder/SKILL.md](skills/flounder/SKILL.md).

## Why Flounder

- **Autonomous audit loop.** `flounder run <clue>` can execute prepare -> map -> dig -> synthesize -> verify -> confirm -> report as a tracked workflow. Prepare can turn a transaction, address, project, repository, or link into staged source and materials; map inventories the audit surface; dig writes and runs proof tests; synthesize composes cross-scope candidates; verify confirms or refutes candidates by local execution; confirm reproduces findings on the real target; report packages reproduced bugs into Markdown reports. The operator does not have to build a custom scenario pipeline for each target.
- **Framework-agnostic reasoning.** Flounder does not encode a Solidity/EVM, ZK/proof-system, Rust, Go, JavaScript, protocol, or crypto-specific audit strategy. Source, corpus, and optional profiles are inputs; the audit strategy comes from the model. As coding models improve, the audit capability can improve without rewriting the framework around every new stack.
- **Execution-grounded findings.** A finding is not real because the model says it is plausible. It must cite a passing local command that exercises the vulnerable path. Stronger findings also pass differential confirmation, independent refutation, and faithful-PoC appeal checks.
- **Versioned coverage and composition.** Scope inventories and model memory are bound to the prepared-material fingerprint. Independent Map inventories are unioned without dropping singleton scopes; every Dig writes a separate obligation/composition outcome, incomplete outcomes stay visible, and cross-scope synthesis runs even when individual scopes produced no finding.
- **Blind discovery plus capability-scoped reproduction.** Discovery runs network-sealed, so findings are derived from the target material rather than copied from disclosures. During `flounder confirm`, only explicit read/fork/fetch commands receive egress for white-hat reproduction and novelty checks; arbitrary model code remains network-sealed.
- **Sandboxed execution boundary.** Model-generated code, PoCs, dependency installs, and local tests run in a copied workspace, not directly in the host checkout. The default OCI backend refuses silent host execution, bind-mounts only the copied workspace and package cache, drops Linux capabilities, uses `no-new-privileges`, read-only root filesystems and tmpfs temp dirs, applies process/memory/CPU limits when configured, and disables network for sealed audit commands. This reduces the blast radius of malicious dependencies, unsafe PoCs, and model mistakes before they can pollute the host machine.
- **Multiple audit scenarios.** Use the same product for blind capability audits, incident investigation from suspicious on-chain evidence, open-world bug-bounty audits, targeted follow-up on suspected findings, and disclosure preparation. Whether Flounder prepares the target itself or you provide source paths is an input path, not the scenario.
- **Durable evaluation groups.** `flounder group` runs validated positive, negative, control, replay, and multi-target work items through the same daemon queue and audit kernel. Group concurrency, attempts, blocked setup, evidence outcomes, and reports survive control-plane restarts. Manifest-provided commands are never executed directly, host execution is rejected, and lifecycle state stays separate from security/scoring outcomes.
- **Governed maintainer experiments.** When the control plane is explicitly started with `flounder ui --maintainer`, `flounder experiment` helps a Flounder maintainer agent mine verifier-grounded Evaluation failures, constrain source proposals to an allowlist, and compare paired baseline/candidate runs. It is not triggered by ordinary Projects and is absent from the default user surface. Promotion requires distinct cases and bug families, passing hidden holdouts and controls, and no paired regressions; merge and deployment remain human gates.
- **Strong fit for Solidity and ZK.** Solidity/EVM targets work well because local forks and Foundry/Hardhat tests can prove real on-chain effects. ZK/proof-system targets work well because local prover and constraint harnesses can turn subtle missing constraints into executable counterexamples. These are high-signal examples, not hard-coded limits.
- **Designed for agent tooling.** Flounder exposes the audit workflow through a CLI, React dashboard, self-describing REST API, pi extension, provider profiles, and daemon execution plane. Codex-style and Claude Code-style providers can be routed through the same sandbox and audit contract.
- **Local control of code and credentials.** The UI server is a control plane. Audits run on a daemon, optionally on another machine, so target code and provider credentials stay on the executor host.
- **Visible, bounded storage retention.** The dashboard warns when the local audit volume is low, attributes run/history/workspace bytes to projects, finds orphaned timestamped runs, and can remove a terminal project's local files while preserving every database record. CLI cleanup is dry-run first and refuses active work.

## Core Scenarios

| Scenario | Start with | How Flounder should behave |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blind capability audit | A public-source or authorized project, repo, package, source tree, or project link, with no bug hint | Let Flounder prepare the target when possible, or provide source/build paths when you already have them. Do not include incident reports, known bug names, exploit theories, or answer-bearing corpus. Judge the result by coverage and execution-backed findings, not by a claim that the target is safe. |
| Incident investigation | A suspicious transaction, address, exploit link, or factual incident clue | Use Prepare to collect chain facts, deployed source, official project material, and reproduction requirements. The clue is evidence, not proof; the output should explain the root cause and whether it reproduced on attacker-real local ground truth. |
| Open-world public-source audit | A public-source target, repository, package, deployment, project, or bounty scope | Let Prepare actively collect official docs, deployments, provenance, package metadata, and bounty scope when available. The audit remains model-directed, but the allowed context is broader than a blind capability test. |
| Normal bug bounty | A public bounty scope, source or deployment, and a private disclosure path | Match technical evidence to the program's official minimum. Keep mandatory scope/live-impact terms separate from duplicate and award uncertainty, and never describe source-only execution as a fork or deployed-target reproduction. |
| Bug bounty contest | A time-limited contest with source, rules, and a venue-specific report format | Use short settled batches so findings reach verify/refute and report quickly. Source-only local confirmation can be reportable when the contest rules do not require live-target reproduction, but suspected-only findings are still not submissions. Preserve prior coverage and submitted findings with append-map expansion instead of remapping from scratch. |
| Targeted follow-up | A suspected finding, scope id, file/region, or prior run | Use `audit --verify`, `audit --scope`, `confirm`, or selected project actions to settle a narrower question by execution. |
| Disclosure preparation | Confirmed or reproduced findings | Consolidate duplicates, run real-target confirmation when required, regenerate selected reports, and package only non-ignored, evidence-backed bugs. |

## Engagement Modes

Projects can record how the audit will be judged without changing the thin audit
kernel. The default `standard` posture is for general authorized review.
`bug-bounty` records normal bounty context: Prepare may collect public program
scope and deployments, Confirm remains expected for live-target reproduction,
and reporting should wait for scope, novelty, known-issue, impact, and payout
gates. `bug-bounty-contest` records a time-limited contest posture: the project
can run short batches, skip real-target confirmation when the rules are
source-only, settle reports before opening the next batch, and append novel
scopes when the inventory is exhausted.

These modes are workflow and evidence gates, not audit strategy. The model still
chooses what to inspect and test; Flounder preserves coverage, duplicate state,
resource blockers, and report readiness so the operator can move quickly without
flattening suspected, confirmed, reproduced, duplicate, and submitted items into
one bucket.

## Preparation Paths

Preparation is about how Flounder receives the target, not what kind of audit it is.

- **Framework-prepared target, recommended by default**: start from a clue such as a project link, repo, package, bounty page, transaction, or address. `flounder run <clue>` runs prepare -> map/dig -> synthesize -> verify -> confirm -> report, and the dashboard uses the same path when the project has a task/clue.
- **Source-provided target**: use `--source`, `--build-root`, and optional `--corpus` when the code is already staged locally or the user explicitly wants no external preparation. This enters the sealed map/dig/synthesize/verify audit directly.
- **Hybrid project**: provide local source/build paths and a task/clue. This is useful for open-world bounty work where Flounder should audit the local checkout but still collect official public context, scope, deployments, and provenance.

## What Flounder Automates

Flounder is built for the parts of security work that usually require a human to keep switching tools and context:

| Step | What Flounder does |
| --- | --- |
| Target preparation | Turns a repo, source tree, package, project link, address, transaction, or prior run into staged audit material. |
| Source and corpus review | Lets the model read source plus project-owned specs, docs, prior audits, and design material. |
| Scope mapping | Enumerates the audit surface and scores scopes before spending deep-audit time. |
| Deep audit | Digs selected scopes obligation-by-obligation instead of doing a shallow one-shot prompt. |
| Exploit construction | Writes local PoCs, tests, fixtures, or harnesses inside an isolated workspace. |
| Sandboxed execution | Runs model-generated tests and PoCs away from the host source tree, credentials, and user environment. |
| Execution proof | Runs the proof locally and only upgrades findings when command evidence exists. |
| Discovery health | Writes run-health and backlog artifacts so a zero-finding run can be distinguished from a shallow run, a missing-resource blocker, or coverage that still needs a later dig. Toolchain warm-up failures are captured as resource requests even when the model did not write one itself, and backlog rows are classified for the project Next Actions queue. |
| Evaluation and replay | Runs positive, negative, control, regression, and multi-target work items with durable concurrency and evidence accounting; regenerates group reports without rerunning model work. |
| Maintainer Harness | Explicit `--maintainer` capability that teaches a repository agent to turn Evaluation failures into bounded source candidates and a reviewable PR; hidden and disabled for ordinary users. |
| Real-target confirmation | Reproduces confirmed findings against real-world ground truth, such as a local fork of a deployed target. |
| Reporting | Tracks one canonical record per exact finding, every occurrence and phase attempt, confirm decisions, formal reports, and submission state across projects. |

## Quickstart

Use Node 24 LTS. This repository includes `.nvmrc` and `.node-version` pinned to
24.13.0, the version used by the test suite.

```bash
nvm use
npm install
npm run build
npm run sandbox:build
```

Command examples below use the installed `flounder` binary. In a fresh source
checkout before installing or linking the package, use `node dist/cli.js` in its
place:

```bash
# Start the local control plane and dashboard.
node dist/cli.js ui
```

After installing the package globally, the same command is:

```bash
flounder ui

# On each executor machine, authenticate the providers it will run.
flounder daemon provider login openai-codex
flounder daemon provider check openai-codex

# For a daemon on another machine, mint a control-plane token first.
flounder server daemon-token mint remote-1
flounder daemon start --server http://<server>:4500 --token <token>
```

`openai-codex` uses pi subscription/OAuth auth. An agent can trigger the user
login by running `flounder daemon provider login openai-codex`; the command
prints a browser URL or device-code instructions for the user to complete. If
the same provider is already logged in through pi at `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`,
Flounder imports that provider entry into its daemon-local auth file on
`login`/`check`.

For other models, follow the [model setup guide](skills/flounder/reference/models.md): choose a provider from the installed pi catalog, configure OAuth or an API key on the execution daemon, and assign the profile to your project. DeepSeek and GLM Coding Plan examples are included.

Then create a project in the dashboard, describe the audit task in the task/clue box, choose its execution daemon and default provider profile, and start a run. The project directory defaults to the project UUID under the daemon workspace, so it stays stable even if the display name changes. A fresh install seeds starter profiles for `openai-codex · gpt-5.6-sol · xhigh`, `openai-codex · gpt-6-astra · medium`, and `claude-code · opus 4.8 max`; each selected daemon still needs local auth for the providers it will run. Settings -> Providers also accepts custom/allowlisted model ids: choose a known model from the same provider as the compatibility base, and Flounder sends that in-memory definition with the job to the project's selected daemon. Any profile can be marked as this control plane's local default for new projects, evaluations, and API/CLI launches that omit an explicit model selection; resetting it restores the product fallback `gpt-5.6-sol`. No credentials or daemon-local pi configuration are stored in the profile. Existing projects keep their explicitly selected profile until an operator changes it. The CLI can drive the same control plane:

```bash
# Recommended default: let Flounder prepare the target, then audit, confirm, and report.
flounder run <tx-or-address-or-project-or-repo-or-link>

# Existing local source: enter sealed map/dig directly.
flounder run --target my-target --source ./src --build-root . --corpus ./docs

# Confirm a finished run against real-world ground truth.
flounder confirm ~/.flounder/my-target-<timestamp> --source ./src --build-root .
```

For a blind capability audit, the clue should name only the public-source or authorized target,
not a suspected bug. For an incident investigation, the clue should be factual
evidence such as a transaction or address. For open-world bounty work, combine
local source paths with a task/clue that names the public program or project so
Prepare can gather official context.

`--mock-llm` runs offline for development. See [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md) for commands, materials, daemon setup, provider profiles, budgets, and the API.

## Scenario Commands

These are starting points. Replace placeholders with public-source or authorized targets and keep
private material out of command lines that may be shared.

### Blind Capability Audit

Use this to measure Flounder's unaided audit ability. Do not include an incident
writeup, known bug name, exploit theory, or answer-bearing corpus.

```bash
# Let Flounder prepare a public-source target.
flounder run https://github.com/org/protocol

# Or audit source that is already staged locally.
flounder run \
  --target protocol-blind \
  --source ./contracts \
  --build-root . \
  --corpus ./docs/specs \
  --max-scopes 30 \
  --dig-samples 2
```

### Incident Investigation

Use this when the input is a suspicious transaction, address, or factual exploit
clue. The clue is evidence, not the root-cause answer.

```bash
flounder run 0x<transaction-hash>
flounder run <deployed-address-or-incident-link>
```

### Open-World Public-Source Audit

Use this when Flounder should collect official public context, deployments,
package metadata, provenance, and bounty scope when available.

```bash
flounder run "Open-world public-source audit for https://github.com/org/protocol; use official docs, deployments, and public scope where available."

# Hybrid project when source is already checked out but Prepare should still gather public context.
# "dir" is under the daemon workspace; source/corpus paths are relative to it.
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"protocol-audit","providerId":1,"daemonId":1,"dir":"protocol","sourcePaths":["contracts"],"buildRoot":".","corpusPaths":["docs"],"config":{"prepareClue":"Open-world public-source audit for <program-or-project-link>; use official docs, deployments, and public scope where available."}}'

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects/<uuid>/runs \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"verb":"run"}'
```

### Scope Mapping And Directed Dig

Use this when the operator wants a scope inventory first, then a specific
follow-up on chosen scopes or regions.

```bash
flounder map --target protocol-map --source ./contracts --build-root . --corpus ./docs/specs
flounder audit --scope <scope-id> --source ./contracts --build-root . --dig-samples 3
flounder audit src/Vault.sol:120-220 --source ./contracts --build-root .
```

### Verify Existing Suspicions

Use this for claims from a prior run, a human review, or an imported JSON file.

```bash
flounder verify claims.json --source ./contracts --build-root .
```

`flounder audit --verify claims.json --source ./contracts --build-root .` is
equivalent.

### Real-Target Confirmation

Use this after a sealed run has locally confirmed findings that need
deployment-level reproduction.

```bash
flounder confirm ~/.flounder/protocol-<timestamp> --source ./contracts --build-root .
```

### Report Regeneration And Finding Triage

Project report generation is project-scoped because it uses tracked findings.
Without a selection it generates only missing formal reports. Selected findings
are regenerated even if a report already exists; `--all` regenerates every
current reportable finding.

```bash
PROJECT_UUID=<uuid>

flounder report --project "$PROJECT_UUID"
flounder report --project "$PROJECT_UUID" --finding 123 --finding 456
flounder report --project "$PROJECT_UUID" --all

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects/$PROJECT_UUID/runs \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"verb":"report","findingIds":[123,456]}'

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects/$PROJECT_UUID/runs \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"verb":"report","regenerateReports":true}'

curl 'http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects/'"$PROJECT_UUID"'/findings?tracking=ignored'

curl -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/findings/123/tracking \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"status":"open"}'
```

### Resumable Coverage And Sampling

Use `--map-samples` for independent inventory enumeration, `--dig-samples` for
independent deep passes, and `--dig-max-samples` for an adaptive ceiling.
`--no-adaptive-dig` disables extra outcome-driven passes. `--eager-prepare`
checks the isolated toolchain before digging. `--verify-concurrency` controls
parallel finding verification. After settling a round,
`flounder continue --project <uuid> --continue-coverage` opens another mapped
batch. See [Coverage Controls](docs/USAGE.md#coverage-controls) for defaults,
material fingerprinting, and the distinction between sampling and new coverage.

## Sandbox Runtime

Real audits execute model-generated commands through the sandbox. The safe default is `--sandbox-backend auto`: on Apple silicon macOS it first uses Apple's `container` runtime when the selected image and sealed network are ready; otherwise it uses Docker-backed OCI when the image is available. If no sandbox engine is ready, it fails closed instead of silently running tests on the host.

For the Docker-backed path, install and start Docker or a Docker-compatible runtime, then build the default image with `npm run sandbox:build`. For the Apple path, install and start Apple's `container` runtime, build or pull the selected sandbox image into that runtime, and let `auto` select it on Apple silicon macOS. `--sandbox-backend apple-container` requires that path explicitly. Sealed Apple commands use an internal host-only, no-DNS `flounder-sealed` network.

The default image is a baseline, not a promise to cover every target stack. It includes common build and audit toolchains so the first run has a safe execution boundary, but specialized targets should use a daemon- or operator-provided image with the exact compiler, prover, chain tooling, or package manager they require:

```bash
flounder run --source ./src --build-root . --sandbox-image your-audit-image:latest
```

For a Rust repository with an exact `rust-toolchain.toml` or `rust-toolchain`
release pin, build the reviewed matching image outside the audit loop:

```bash
npm run sandbox:rust:target -- --target <target-root> --execute
flounder run --source ./src --build-root . --sandbox-image flounder-sandbox:rust-1.86.0
```

Use `--runtime container` to build into Apple's container runtime. The command
prints the exact build plan by default and rejects moving/non-exact channels.

Image construction is part of the trusted execution base. The audit model may report missing toolchains or propose an image recipe, but it should not receive unrestricted `docker build` / `docker pull` capability inside the audit loop. A safe automation path is to generate a reviewable target-specific image plan, build it in a controlled daemon/operator step, then pin and reuse that image by name or digest.

For trusted local smoke tests only, use `--sandbox-backend host --allow-host-execution` or set `FLOUNDER_ALLOW_HOST_EXECUTION=1`. Host mode still uses the copied workspace plus isolated `HOME` and package-cache paths, but it cannot enforce command-level network sealing or provide kernel-level filesystem isolation and should not be used for untrusted targets, malicious dependencies, or real model-generated exploit code.

## Use It Yourself

Agents can drive everything through [skills/flounder/SKILL.md](skills/flounder/SKILL.md), but every step is also exposed directly:

- **Dashboard**: `flounder ui` for projects, daemons, provider profiles, runs, scopes, findings, live activity, and reports.
- **CLI**: workflow verbs (`prepare`, `run`, `map`, `audit`, `verify`, `confirm`, `report`), run-history import, control-plane resources under `flounder server ...`, daemon-local operations under `flounder daemon ...`, and `config`.
- **REST API**: `GET /api` returns the self-describing catalog; agents can create projects, enqueue runs, watch logs, and read findings without the UI.
- **pi extension**: `flounder_prepare`, `flounder_run`, `flounder_map`, `flounder_audit`, and `flounder_confirm` expose the agent-session workflow tools when loaded through pi.

## How It Works

The tracked workflow is:

1. **Prepare**: acquire or stage source, corpus, dependency closure, and deployment-match evidence when the run starts from a clue.
2. **Map**: enumerate and score the audit surface without producing findings.
3. **Dig**: deep-audit selected scopes and attempt to prove each new finding locally while its source context is still active.
4. **Synthesize**: compose per-scope findings into distinct cross-scope bug candidates.
5. **Verify candidates**: settle only the suspected or synthesized candidates that Dig did not already prove or refute. Each claim runs in an isolated workspace with bounded concurrency; an unchanged blocked attempt waits for changed materials or an explicit retry instead of draining again. Standalone `verify` also accepts imported prior claims.
6. **Confirm**: reproduce confirmed findings on real-world ground truth and decide whether they are submission candidates.
7. **Report**: generate formal Markdown reports for reproduced or source-provided locally confirmed bugs.

You can run that end to end or drive each phase directly:

| Command | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `flounder prepare <clue>` | open-world acquisition from a transaction, address, project, package, repository, or link into staged source, corpus, dependency closure, and deployment-match evidence |
| `flounder run <clue>` | one-command prepare -> sealed map/dig/synthesize/verify -> confirm -> report from a transaction, address, repo, package, project, bounty, or link |
| `flounder run --source <paths...> --target <name>` | source-provided sealed audit: map -> dig -> synthesize -> verify on source already staged locally |
| `flounder map --target <name> --source <paths...>` | enumerate and persist the scope inventory only; no findings |
| `flounder audit <region> --source <paths...>` | deep-audit one named file/function/region without a new map |
| `flounder audit --scope <id,...> --source <paths...>` | deep-audit selected inventory scopes after `flounder map` |
| `flounder audit --verify <file> --source <paths...>` | confirm or refute suspected findings from JSON by execution |
| `flounder verify <file> --source <paths...>` | alias for `audit --verify`; confirm or refute suspected findings from JSON by execution |
| `flounder confirm <run-dir> --source <paths...>` | reproduce locally confirmed findings on real-world ground truth |
| `flounder report --project <uuid\|name> [--finding <id>...] [--all]` | generate missing formal reports, regenerate selected reports, or regenerate every current reportable finding |
| `flounder history import-run --target <name> --run <dir>` | import an existing run directory into tracked history |
| `flounder server project list` | list tracked projects |
| `flounder server run list [--project <name>]` | list global or project run history |
| `flounder server finding list [--project <name>] [--status <s>] [--tracking <s>]` | list findings globally or for one project |
| `flounder server daemon list` | list registered execution daemons |
| `flounder server daemon-token mint [name] [--server <url>]` | create a token for a remote daemon |
| `flounder daemon start --server <url> --token <token>` | run an executor that claims queued jobs |
| `flounder daemon provider list/check/login [provider]` | manage provider auth on the executor machine |
| `flounder config list/get/set/unset/path` | read or write persisted CLI defaults |
| `flounder storage report [--json]` | show disk pressure and per-project local storage |
| `flounder storage clean --project <uuid\|name> [--apply]` | preview or apply metadata-only retention cleanup |
| `flounder storage compact [--apply]` | preview or remove terminal-run inspection copies |
| `flounder ui [--port <n>] [--host <h>] [--no-daemon]` | start the local control-plane dashboard, REST API, store, and optional co-located daemon |

Formal report generation is available from the dashboard More actions menu or
the project runs API with `{"verb":"report"}`. It is intentionally tied to a
tracked project because it needs finding ids, tracking state, and confirm
decisions.

A finding's status is the framework's verdict from execution:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `confirmed-differential` | The exploit ran and the model's minimal fix blocked it while the test still ran. |
| `confirmed-executable` | A cited local confirmation test triggered the bug. |
| `confirmed-source` | Source-backed evidence is present, but local executable verification is still required. |
| `needs-evidence` | Local review completed, but the claim needs external evidence to settle. |
| `suspected` | Credible but not execution-proven, or downgraded by refutation. |
| `refuted` | A skeptic or real-target reproduction broke the claim. |

Confirm decisions expose four independent axes in the API, dashboard, and
generated decision reports: **program minimum** (`met`, `not-met`, or
`unknown`), **technical evidence boundary** (from reasoned/source-supported
through source execution, local integration, local fork, or deployed-target
reproduction), **submission advice**, and **reward/duplicate adjudication
risk**. “Eligible to submit” therefore means the configured mandatory program
terms and evidence minimum are met. It does not promise acceptance or an award,
and the decision also lists stronger evidence that was not demonstrated.

## Outputs

A run produces private artifacts under the output directory. By default, Flounder keeps local state under `~/.flounder`:

- `~/.flounder/flounder.db`: local tracking database for projects, runs, scopes, canonical findings and occurrences, phase attempts, evaluations, discovery backlog, daemon tokens, and jobs.
- `~/.flounder/<target>-<timestamp>/`: run artifacts, copied workspaces, logs, transcripts, findings, and reports.
- `~/.flounder/history/<target>/`: durable memory, scope inventory, build cache, and project history.
- `~/.flounder/workspace/`: default daemon workspace for project directories.
- `~/.flounder/agent/auth.json`: daemon-local provider auth, created by `flounder daemon provider login` or imported from an existing pi auth entry.

System temp directories are used only for short-lived scratch such as non-interactive CLI subprocess working directories or inline verify payloads; they are not the default tracking store.

A run artifact directory contains:

- scope inventory and coverage (`audit_scopes.json`, `summary.json`)
- findings and hypotheses (`audit_findings.json`, `audit_hypotheses.json`)
- command evidence (`audit_command_runs.json`)
- discovery health and backlog (`run_health.json`, `coverage_gaps.json`, `resource_requests.json`, `followup_scopes.json`)
- live/replay trace (`events.jsonl`, `audit_transcript.json`, `calls/*.json`)
- private report drafts (`audit_report.md`, `report_<id>.md`)
- confirm decision sheets (`confirm_decision.json`, `confirm_report.md`, `confirm_equivalence.json`, and bounty-like `impact_inventory.json` when live exposure evidence is attempted)

The dashboard stores metadata, run health, discovery backlog rows, and artifact paths in SQLite so an agent can inspect progress without scraping run directories.

## Dashboard

`flounder ui` is a local control plane and dashboard for projects, evaluations, daemons, provider profiles, runs, scopes, findings, reports, and live activity. A project is pinned to an execution daemon and a default provider profile, with optional per-phase provider overrides for prepare, map, dig, and confirm. A profile may register a custom model id by naming a known same-provider compatibility base; the selected definition travels with the job and is resolved in memory by the chosen daemon. The selected daemon must be authenticated for every provider profile the project can use. New projects start from a prominent task/clue input, can run immediately after creation, and default their daemon workspace directory to the project UUID.

The project view shows the prepare -> map -> dig -> synthesize -> verify -> confirm -> report workflow, current phase, scope coverage, run health, a **Next Actions** queue, live provider reasoning summaries, findings as they land, per-finding confirm actions, real-target reproduction status, and reports. Concurrent Dig work is separated into one Activity lane per scope, with pipeline events kept in their own lane. Dig attempts local proof during discovery; **Verify candidates** is the explicit follow-up for unresolved or synthesized claims, not a second full audit. Continue resumes an interrupted Dig batch first, but when only verify/confirm/report work remains it starts directly at that evidence tail instead of creating an empty Dig run. Next Actions is an agent-owned work queue: coverage work can Continue, Expand map, or prioritize scopes; setup work asks the agent to resolve toolchain, sandbox, dependency, source, or auth blockers when possible; routing work asks the agent to inspect ambiguous rows and choose the next safe workflow action. The operator is asked only for explicit credentials, authorization, or unavailable external resources. The primary action is **Run** before the first pipeline run and **Continue** after one exists; finer-grained Prepare, Map, Dig, Verify candidates, Confirm, and Report actions live under More actions. The project list can pin projects, archive them to Settings, unarchive them later, and drag active projects into a manual order. **Settings -> Storage** reports local disk pressure and project ownership, then previews a metadata-only retention cleanup before removing files.

A cross-project Findings view tracks every project finding through submission states. Each row shows only the current phase and its blocker or next action; opening the workflow/report detail reveals the full local-verification, real-target, and formal-report attempt history plus focused retry controls. Evaluation evidence is excluded by default and can be inspected with the explicit source filter; those rows link back to their Evaluation and do not expose disclosure tracking controls.

The Evaluations view creates and operates durable audit, benchmark, regression, and verification run groups. Ordinary users see only this evidence workspace. When a Flounder source maintainer explicitly starts the control plane with `--maintainer`, an additional **Harness · Maintainer** mode becomes available for governed baseline/candidate experiments. Each item uses a hidden tracking project, and every attempt receives a fresh scope/memory/transcript namespace while sharing only the target dependency cache. Project jobs are claimed ahead of queued Evaluation jobs on a shared daemon; already-running work is never preempted. Lifecycle completion is never presented as an evidence pass by itself, and a promotion recommendation never merges or deploys code.

Every UI operation is also a REST call. `GET /api` returns the API catalog, `GET /api/projects/:uuid/backlog` lists discovery backlog rows with `actionability`, `action_owner`, and `recommended_action` metadata, `GET /api/findings/:id/lifecycle` returns occurrences and phase attempts, `POST /api/findings/:id/retry` reopens one blocked phase, `PATCH /api/backlog/:id` updates operator state, and `GET /api/runs/:id/log` streams the executing daemon's provider reasoning summaries, output, tool calls, and milestones with per-stream identifiers.

## White-Hat Boundary

Flounder supports white-hat audits of publicly available source, your own code, client-authorized targets, or public bug-bounty scope. Sealed discovery is local-only. Model-generated files and commands run inside the copied sandbox workspace instead of directly mutating the host checkout. Open-world confirmation can fetch, search, fork, and read, but it must never broadcast transactions, move funds, submit writes, persist access, or target systems outside the declared target boundary. Replay exploits only against local tests, local forks, or isolated harnesses, and disclose public-source findings privately unless a bounty program defines another path. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
