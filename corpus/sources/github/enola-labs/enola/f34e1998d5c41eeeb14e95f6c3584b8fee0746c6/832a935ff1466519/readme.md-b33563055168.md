**Catch structural regressions that builds and tests cannot see:** new dependency cycles, violated layer boundaries, undeclared service dependencies, and changes that spread beyond their intended scope.

Enola maps your codebase before a change and compares it with the structure afterward. The result is about **this change** — not every problem already in the repository — and only the rules you choose can fail the build.

- **Exact, local measurement.** Parsed source and graph algorithms; no model, embeddings, upload, account, or license check.
- **One graph across the repository.** [23 languages and formats](#supported-languages), detected automatically and combined into one baseline and verdict.
- **One loop everywhere.** Your coding agent reads the graph before it edits and receives the verdict afterward; the same check runs from the CLI or in CI.

**Documentation:** [Choose a guide by task](docs/README.md) · [CLI reference](docs/CLI.md) · [Architecture internals](ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Try it read-only

After installing the one binary, run Enola against a repository you already have:

```bash
enola --explain /path/to/your/repo
```

No baseline, config file or MCP client. Nothing is written to disk. Enola prints the architecture it measured — patterns, cycles, layer violations, hotspots, blast radius and structural outliers — then exits.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enola-labs/enola/main/install.sh | sh
enola --explain .
```

If that map looks right, regression testing is the same measurement with a *before* to compare against.

## One change, one verdict

A helper added to `storage` imports the delivery layer. The code builds and every test passes. The dependency now points against the layer order the repository declared:

```
FAIL — 1 structural regression introduced.

Regressions (fail):
  - [layers] 1.00 — Layer violation: storage -> delivery
      import of notify

Policy: fail on new findings from [layers] at confidence >= 1.00.
```

Exit code `1` lets the agent fix the regression before it reports done, or lets a commit hook or CI stop it. Enola shipped with no opinion about your layers; it graded this crossing because the repository declared the order:

```yaml
# enola-intent.yaml
layers:                          # outermost first
  - {name: delivery, paths: ["web/**", "notify/**"]}
  - {name: api,      paths: ["api/**"]}
  - {name: storage,  paths: ["storage/**"]}
```

[`examples/layers-gate/`](examples/layers-gate/) is the complete five-package example in one command. [What fails the build](#what-fails-the-build) explains every policy; [the full verdict](#what-the-verdict-tells-you) names the symbols and edges the change added.

## Quickstart: close the loop around a coding agent

**1. Install the binary.** No Go toolchain, no C compiler - Linux, macOS (amd64/arm64) and Windows:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enola-labs/enola/main/install.sh | sh
```

That drops one binary into `~/.local/bin`. If the next command comes back `enola: command not found`, that directory isn't on your `PATH` yet:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Or install it from a package index. Every route delivers the same binary, and the command is always `enola`:

```bash
pip install enola-cli
```

```ruby
gem "enola"   # then: bundle exec enola
```

The PyPI project is called `enola-cli` because `enola` was already taken there. The Ruby gems are maintained at [enola-labs/enola-rb](https://github.com/enola-labs/enola-rb) and fetch the same release on first use.

**Ruby and Rails?** There is a community-maintained gem that wraps the same release, fetches the binary on first use and forwards every command - and `enola-rb` adds a Rails generator plus `enola:snapshot` / `enola:check` rake tasks:

```bash
bundle add enola-rb
bin/rails generate enola:install
bin/rake enola:check
```

Both Ruby fact providers are on by default there. The gems are maintained by [Muhamed Isabegović](https://github.com/misabegovic) at [misabegovic/enola-rb](https://github.com/misabegovic/enola-rb); issues and pull requests belong there. See [docs/RAILS.md](docs/RAILS.md).

**2. Tell your agents it exists, and close the loop automatically:**

```bash
enola install --hooks
```

This writes enola's instructions into the files your agents already read - Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Codex, Pi, opencode - and `--hooks` adds the two hooks that grade each session for you. In opencode, which has no hook configuration of that shape, `--hooks` installs a plugin instead: the first `grep`, `glob` or `list` of a session is refused with the enola tool that answers it from the index, bounded to two refusals and dropped the moment any enola tool is called. Without `--hooks` you get instructions and nothing else, which an agent is free to read and then ignore - on a small local model it usually does. It previews every change and asks before writing, never creates a shared file like `AGENTS.md` that wasn't already there, and `enola uninstall` reverses everything byte-for-byte, including the files and directories it created itself.

**3. Give your agent the graph over MCP.** Pick your client:

| Client | Do this |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `claude mcp add enola enola` |
| **Copilot (VS Code)** | `code --add-mcp '{"name":"enola","command":"enola"}'` |
| **Cursor** | add the block below to `.cursor/mcp.json` (or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for every project) |
| **opencode** | already done by step 2 - it is the one client `enola install` registers for you |
| **Codex** | `codex mcp add enola -- enola` |
| **Other MCP clients** | add the block below to its MCP config |

<details>
<summary>MCP config block</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "enola": {
      "command": "enola"
    }
  }
}
```

Copilot's `.vscode/mcp.json` uses `servers` as the top-level key instead of `mcpServers`. A config path in `args` is optional everywhere - omit it to run on built-in defaults. Full details and per-client restart instructions: [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md).

</details>

**4. Confirm it actually works.** After your next session:

```bash
enola doctor
```

A report, not a gate - it always exits `0`. It is the fastest way to find out that something has gone quietly wrong:

- **whether the hooks fired.** A hook configuration is a contract with your agent, and one it silently ignores looks exactly like one it honours, so `doctor` reports when each hook last ran rather than whether it is configured.
- **whether your baseline still counts.** One pinned by a different enola version, or under different ignore rules, is not comparable - and nothing is graded against it until you re-pin.
- **whether there is a newer release** - and specifically whether the **extractors** changed, which means your snapshots are missing facts a current build would find. `enola upgrade` installs it.

**5. Explore the architecture visually.** Once a snapshot exists, open the read-only local dashboard:

```bash
enola dashboard --open
```

It stays attached to the terminal until you press Ctrl-C. Use **Refresh** when you want to load a newer snapshot written for that repository, so the graph does not change while you inspect it. The opening screen prioritizes findings and architectural changes; lifetime usage has its own screen, while ports, processes, and paths live under Diagnostics. If no snapshot exists yet, the dashboard shows the exact generation command. Repository data never leaves your machine. See the **[dashboard user guide](docs/DASHBOARD.md)** for a walkthrough of every tab.

### Not using an agent?

The gate is a plain CLI. No MCP, no hooks, no config file:

```bash
enola baseline pin              # freeze the architecture before you edit
#   …make your change…
enola check                     # report what it did - always exit 0
enola check --fail-on=layers    # …and exit 1 on the part you named
```

Same commands and same exit codes in CI, on every pull request. Every flag and all four exit codes: **[docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md)**.

## What the verdict tells you

A verdict you can't act on is just a red light. Here is the `storage`/`notify` run from the top of this page in full - verbatim output, nothing trimmed:

```
FAIL — 1 structural regression introduced.

Regressions (fail):
  - [layers] 1.00 — Layer violation: storage -> delivery
      import of notify

Policy: fail on new findings from [layers] at confidence >= 1.00.

What changed
  symbols      +1
  dependencies +1
  edges        +4  (imports +1, calls +2, declares +1)

Added (2):
  symbol     storage.LoadPrice                            storage/storage.go:11
  dependency storage -> layersgate/notify                 storage/storage.go:3

New coupling (4):
  storage                                      --imports--> notify
  storage.LoadPrice                            --calls--> notify.SendReceipt
  storage.LoadPrice                            --calls--> storage.ReadPrice
  storage.LoadPrice                            --declares--> storage

New coupling is reported, not failed: an added call edge is what ordinary work
looks like. Inspect the list above if it is more than you expected.
```

Every line is the change, and nothing else. Five packages here, for readability - but on a 68,000-fact repository already carrying 268 findings it behaves identically, reporting the one thing this change introduced and none of the other 268. Long lists are capped at twelve entries with a `… N more` line; `--detail` prints all of them, `--json` emits the whole delta.

Note what the compiler had to say about that import: nothing. `go build ./...` is perfectly happy, `go vet` is silent, and no test fails - the file that introduces it looks entirely reasonable on its own. The defect is the edge, not the line, and the only thing it contradicts is an order you wrote down somewhere else.

Run the same change without naming a policy and you get the other half of the contract - the finding, and an explicit statement that nothing was enforced:

```
PASS — 1 new finding reported, nothing enforced: no policy set.

New findings (reported — no failure policy set):
  - [layers] 1.00 — Layer violation: storage -> delivery
      import of notify

No --fail-on policy is set, so nothing in this run could fail the build. These are
reported for you to judge. Enforce the ones you want enforced: --fail-on=layers
(`enola check --help` lists all 17).
```

A gate that enforces nothing has to *say* it enforces nothing. Silence there is indistinguishable from an all-clear, and that is the one failure mode a green exit code cannot report on its own.

## The loop

**Before a change**, your agent has the real structure of the codebase: a deterministic graph of modules, symbols, routes and storage, and how they depend on each other, extracted from source rather than inferred. It can look up what actually depends on the thing it's about to touch, instead of guessing from a grep.

**After a change**, enola grades what happened. It compares against the pinned graph and reports the delta: findings introduced or resolved, coupling added, symbols added and removed. It shows you everything the change actually did, and stays silent about everything that was already there.

It runs in three places, each usable on its own:

| | |
|---|---|
| **In your agent** | a hook grades each session and hands the verdict back, so the agent reports what it moved - or fixes its own regression - before telling you it's done |
| **In your shell** | `enola check` - reports the delta, and exits `1` on whatever `--fail-on` names |
| **In CI** | the same command, same exit code, on every pull request - or [`enola-action`](https://github.com/enola-labs/enola-action), which wires it to the pull-request base for you |

Add the CI gate from **[Enola Architecture Check on the GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/enola-architecture-check)**,
or start from the [complete workflow example](examples/ci/architecture-gate.yml).

The whole loop, unedited - the change is reported and nothing fails, the same run under a stated policy fails on the layer it crossed, and the fix lets it through:

![enola check on the layers-gate example: a helper added to storage imports the delivery layer, the default run reports it and exits 0, --fail-on=layers fails the same change, and after the fix the re-run passes](docs/images/layers-gate.gif)

<sub>Three runs of one command on the same change. `&& echo` never fires while the gate is red - and in the first run there is no gate to be red, which the output says out loud. Recorded from [`examples/layers-gate/`](examples/layers-gate/) with [`docs/images/layers-gate.tape`](docs/images/layers-gate.tape).</sub>

## What fails the build

Two separate things decide that, and confusing them is the fastest way to be surprised by this tool: **what enola finds**, and **what your policy fails on**. enola runs all nineteen of its checks - it calls them **explainers** - on every single run. The policy picks which of their findings are allowed to set the exit code.

**Out of the box that policy is empty.** Every finding is reported, the run exits `0`, and the output says in as many words that nothing was enforced. Nothing breaks until you name what should break:

- code reaching across a layer order you declared, like storage talking straight to the delivery layer (`layers`)
- two modules that ended up depending on each other (`cycles`)
- a cross-repo seam nobody declared, or a declared one the graph never measured (`intent`)
- a single function or type that a large part of the codebase depends on (`god-class`)
- a function that nearly everything calls (`hotspots`)
- an import chain ten modules deep (`dependency-depth`)
- a function far more complicated than the rest of your code (`complexity-outliers`)
- a package that exports almost everything it contains, instead of a small surface (`exported-surface`)
- API routes that nothing in the code you loaded ever calls (`unused-routes`)
- outbound calls enola could not match to any route it loaded (`coverage`)
- messaging call sites without an AsyncAPI contract, and contract operations without detected code (`messaging-coverage`)
- which repositories in a cluster ended up depending on which (`crossrepo`)
- directories that look like vendored third-party code, reported so you can decide whether to ignore them (`vendored-candidates` — informational, so it can never fail a build)
- what `import yourpackage` executes in Python, and the package `__init__.py` files responsible for most of it (`import-closure` — the summary is informational; the barrels it names are gateable)

**enola holds itself to this.** This repository declares its own layer order in [`enola-intent.yaml`](enola-intent.yaml) - six layers, entrypoint down to the fact model - and its CI runs `enola check --fail-on=layers` against it. Not `--fail-on=cycles`: enola is written in Go, where the compiler already refuses an import cycle between packages, so gating on one would enforce a rule the toolchain enforces first. The layer order is the part the compiler cannot see. Nothing but that file stops `internal/upgrade` importing `pkg/cli` today, and the build is green either way until something says otherwise.

**Why nothing is on by default.** enola used to fail on a new dependency cycle out of the box. A cycle is exactly measurable - Tarjan's SCC algorithm, no estimate anywhere - and that made it a tempting default. But *exactly measurable* is not the same as *unwanted*: Go's compiler forbids import cycles between packages outright, so a Go team's answer to the finding is usually "the compiler already has this covered"; a Rails app wires most of its graph at runtime, and two `app/` directories referencing each other is not something that community reads as a defect at all. A tool that arrives asserting otherwise spends its first impression being argued with, and the first thing those teams learn about it is which flag turns it off.

So enola states what it measured and stops there. The exception it makes for itself is the one above: an unenforced run must say it enforced nothing, because a silent green is exactly what a broken gate looks like.

**Any of the nineteen can fail the build.** `--fail-on` takes the names above as a comma-separated list, and `--min-confidence` sets the floor within them. Two more things can fail it that are not findings at all:

- **scope spillover** - packages your change reached outside the area you declared with `--target`, gated with `--max-spillover=N`. A change can trip this with zero failing findings.
- **a gate that could not run.** A missing baseline or a bad flag exits `2`; a baseline that isn't comparable to the current code exits `3` and enola declines to grade rather than blaming your change. Neither is a judgement about the code, and neither is suppressed by `--warn-only`.

**Which of them can actually fail at the default floor: three.** `cycles`, `intent`, and `layers` when the order is declared in `enola-intent.yaml` are the ones enola computes with certainty, so only they reach `1.00`. Everything else is an estimate measured against your own repository - "this file has unusually many dependents *for this codebase*" - and caps below `1.00` by design ([`MaxHeuristicConfidence`](internal/explainers/common/common.go) is `0.95`). Naming an inferred explainer in `--fail-on` and nothing else therefore changes nothing at all; it needs `--min-confidence` too.

### Changing what counts

| You want | Run |
|---|---|
| The default: report everything, fail nothing | `enola check` |
| Fail on violations of a layer order you declared | `enola check --fail-on=layers` |
| Also fail on a cross-repo seam nobody declared, a declared rule breached, and new cycles | `enola check --fail-on=layers,intent,cycles,constraints` |
| Everything above, plus every explainer enola infers rather than proves | `enola check --fail-on=layers,intent,cycles,constraints,crossrepo,coverage,unused-routes,messaging-coverage,god-class,hotspots,dependency-depth,exported-surface,complexity-outliers,domain,query-loops,entry-points,dead-methods --min-confidence=0.8` |
| Fail if the change spread outside the area you named | `enola check --target=internal/auth --max-spillover=0` |
| Enforce a policy you set, but only warn this time | `enola check --fail-on=layers --warn-only` |

That fifth row is a different question from the others. `--target` is you saying *"this change is about `internal/auth`"*; enola works out which packages depend on it, then reports any package your change touched that isn't in that group - something you edited that your own description didn't cover. Two snapshots can tell you what changed; only you can say what you meant to change.

<details>
<summary><b>Four things that will bite you</b></summary>

- **A run with no `--fail-on` cannot fail.** That is the default, and it is deliberate - but it means a CI job that pins a baseline, runs `enola check` and reports green has enforced nothing. The output says so in a line; a job that only reads the exit code will not see it.
- **`--min-confidence` lowers the bar; it doesn't raise it.** The default floor is `1.00`, which is already the strictest setting there is. `--min-confidence=0.8` makes the gate fail on *more*, not less.
- **Confidence is per finding, not per explainer.** `layers` is the one that catches people: violations of a layer order you *declared* score `1.00`, violations of a pattern it *recognised* score `0.80`. So on a repo with no declared layer order, `--fail-on=layers` changes nothing until you also pass `--min-confidence=0.8`.
- **A misspelled name is not an error.** It just never matches anything, so the gate goes quiet instead of complaining. `enola check --json` prints the policy that actually ran - compare it against what you typed.

The policy lives in flags, not in `mcp-arch.yaml`, so a pre-commit hook and a CI job can deliberately hold you to different standards.

</details>

### A failure with no failing finding

Scope is graded separately from findings, so a change can break the build having violated nothing at all. This run names no `--fail-on` whatsoever - the layer violation is reported and explicitly not enforced - and it still exits `1`, because the change touched a package its author never said it was about:

```
## Scope

**Reached beyond the declared scope.** 1 of 2 package(s) touched were predicted or declared, match ratio 0.5.

Spillover — touched but neither predicted nor declared:
  - telemetry

A package here was changed by something the declaration did not describe.
That is worth reading even when every finding is clean.

Predicted but not touched (usually fine — the change was narrower than its blast radius):
  - api
  - web
FAIL — 1 structural regression introduced.

Measurements over threshold:
  - [fail] 1 package(s) reached outside the declared scope

New findings (reported — no failure policy set):
  - [layers] 1.00 — Layer violation: storage -> delivery
      import of notify

No --fail-on policy is set, so no FINDING could fail this run — only the threshold
above grades it. These are reported for you to judge; enforce the ones you want
enforced: --fail-on=layers (`enola check --help` lists all 17).
```

The `--target` you declare is a claim about intent, and this is the gate holding you to it. Nothing here is a judgement about `telemetry` - the code may be perfectly good. It is a report that the change did something its own description didn't cover.

## Limitations

What enola does not do, and where each limit is documented in full.

- enola models structure: modules, symbols, routes, storage, dependencies and the edges between them. It has no representation for runtime behaviour - a timeout, a retry budget, whether a message can be lost - and cannot report on any of it.
- Of the nineteen explainers, only `cycles`, `intent`, `constraints` and a declared layer order produce findings at confidence `1.00`. That is the floor `check` gates at, so naming the others in `--fail-on` has no effect unless you also lower `--min-confidence`. See [docs/EXPLAINERS.md](docs/EXPLAINERS.md).
- Most findings are advisory. Across the benchmark corpus, 96.3% of them could not fail a build under the default policy.
- The gate grades the delta against a baseline, so pre-existing findings stay silent and a repository can carry them indefinitely while every check passes. Read the findings directly to pay down existing debt.
- Outlier thresholds are computed per repository. A uniformly complex codebase produces few findings, and a clean check means the change introduced nothing new rather than that the repository is clean.
- The graph has an explicit analysis scope and visible limits. Ignore rules define which files are included; each snapshot separately reports configured exclusions, parse failures and relationships that enola detected but could not resolve. Per-language extraction limits are documented in [docs/extraction/](docs/extraction/), and explainers that under-report say so in [docs/EXPLAINERS.md](docs/EXPLAINERS.md). [docs/BLIND-SPOTS.md](docs/BLIND-SPOTS.md) records how such gaps were found.
- Confidence is comparable within an explainer but not across explainers, so enola does not rank findings or say what to fix first.

## Why not CodeGraph, graphify, or codebase-memory-mcp?

Several open-source projects turn a repository into a queryable graph for an AI agent. They are well built and they optimize for different things:

| | Optimizes for |
|---|---|
| CodeGraph | returning the matching source in the payload, so the agent never opens a file |
| graphify | code alongside PDFs and transcripts in one knowledge base |
| codebase-memory-mcp | indexing Kubernetes manifests next to code, in C, on in-memory SQLite |
| **enola** | the graph **plus a before/after verdict** - `check` exits `1`, so it can gate a build |

All of them answer *what does this codebase look like*. enola also answers *what did this change just do to it*, which is why it pins a baseline and why it has an exit code.

A benchmark-backed teardown of all four - storage engines, memory profiles, what each choice costs, and where each of the others is the better pick - is here, with links to every project: **[Four code graphs, four storage engines](https://menges.dev/writing/four-code-graphs-four-storage-engines/)**.

### And what about the tools you already have?

| | Tells you |
|---|---|
| **Git diff** | which lines changed |
| **Tests** | whether the behaviour you tested still works |
| **Linter** | whether local rules were violated, file by file |
| **Code review** | whatever a human notices, after the work is finished |
| **`enola check`** | **what the change did to the structure of the system** |

A layer crossed the wrong way, an endpoint no client calls any more, a change that quietly reached three packages further than its author described: each one spans files, breaks no test, and is easy for a reviewer to miss. AI agents can write more code than you can carefully review; that gap is where structural damage accumulates, and it usually surfaces months later when the package is too tangled to refactor.

## How it works

enola parses your source with tree-sitter and language-specific extractors, normalizes it into a typed fact model, links it into a directed graph, and runs graph algorithms over it: Tarjan's SCC to find groups of modules that can all reach each other (a cycle), cycle-safe longest-path for the deepest import chain, and mean+2σ outlier tests to flag what sits two standard deviations above your own repository's average. No language model, no embeddings. Terms enola uses in its own output are defined in **[docs/GLOSSARY.md](docs/GLOSSARY.md)**.

**Deterministic.** The same commit yields the same answer, every time: across 81 open-source repositories indexed three times each, all 81 produced a byte-identical snapshot ID and a byte-identical fact file, over 7.0 million facts with zero parse errors ([BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md)). Every snapshot carries a **receipt**: enola's version, the git ref and whether the tree was dirty, the extractors used, and a snapshot ID that's a `sha256` fingerprint of the facts rather than a random UUID. Before comparing two snapshots, enola checks they were built the same way - a different extractor set or changed ignore rules makes a diff meaningless, and it reports that instead of treating the mismatch as your change.

**Fast enough for every commit.** On that same corpus, a warm re-index of an unchanged tree took 7.5s for grafana (10,313 files, 167,987 facts) and 52.6s for the Linux kernel (55,408 files, 1.9M facts). Full per-repository numbers, cold and warm, are in [BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).

**Local.** enola runs as a local binary reading local files. Nothing leaves your machine, and there is no license check anywhere in this repository.

**[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** has the fact model, the pipeline, the MCP tool reference and the analysis internals.

## Beyond one repository

Point enola at your backend *and* the things that call it - a web app, a mobile app, another service - and it joins them into one graph. Your agent can then answer the question that normally costs you a morning and two colleagues:

> *If I change this endpoint, what breaks?*

It joins the two sides wherever they meet: a web client's `fetch()` to the route that serves it, a mobile app's call to that same route (an iOS endpoint enum, an Android Retrofit interface), a gRPC call to the service behind it, one service's Kafka producer to another's consumer.

**The hard part is that the two sides rarely spell the endpoint the same way.** Your frontend calls `/api/courses`. Your backend file says:

```go
r.HandleFunc("/courses", listCourses)
```

The `/api` was attached somewhere else entirely - in whatever function set this router up, quite possibly in another package. Compare the two strings literally and you find nothing, so enola follows that prefix across function and package boundaries (*interprocedurally*) and files the route under the address it actually answers on: `/api/courses`. Same story for an Express router declared in `routes/webhooks.js` and mounted in `index.js`, Axum's `.nest()`, Rails' `scope` and `namespace`, and a Swift endpoint enum whose version prefix lives three files away in a protocol extension.

Once both ends line up, `enola check` grades a change spanning two repos exactly the way it grades one that doesn't.

**It also tells you what it missed.** Some calls can't be resolved - a URL assembled at runtime, a client library enola doesn't know - and a tool that quietly drops those looks identical to one that found everything:

```bash
enola coverage cluster.yaml
```

That reports, per service, how many outbound calls it found, how many it matched to a route, and **how many it couldn't**. Which is the difference between a service that genuinely talks to nothing and a service whose edges enola just failed to follow.

[`examples/cross-repo/`](examples/cross-repo/) is a two-service demo you can run in one command. It contains one deliberately unresolvable call, so you can see what a miss looks like before you go looking for them in your own code.

## Supported languages

Nothing here is a setting. enola looks for the markers below and runs whatever it finds, so a repository that is two languages is indexed as two languages without being told - and a language you don't see listed is a gap worth [reporting](https://github.com/enola-labs/enola/issues), not a verdict on whether enola is for you.

| Language   | Detected by |
|------------|-------------|
| Go         | `go.mod` (gorilla/mux + chi route composition / gRPC clients / Kafka topics aware) |
| Java       | `pom.xml` (Maven) or `.java` sources (Spring routes / JPA / Lombok DI / Dubbo SPI aware) |
| JavaScript | `tsconfig.json` / `package.json` with TypeScript (parsed by the TypeScript extractor) |
| TypeScript | `tsconfig.json` / `package.json` with TypeScript (Next.js, React Navigation & monorepo aware; Express sub-router mounts composed across files) |

| Ruby       | `Gemfile`, any loose `.rb`/`.rake`, or a Rails **engine** (`config/routes.rb` beside `lib/**/engine.rb`) — Rails routes across every engine and plugin route file, `mount` composed into the mounted engine's own routes, controller actions resolved from `resources`; **Grape** APIs found by transitive inheritance with mount prefixes composed across files; ActiveRecord / Sequel / Packwerk aware |
| Rust       | `Cargo.toml` (workspace or single crate; crate/module/`impl`/trait aware; Axum route DSL aware) |

| Terraform / HCL | any `.tf`/`.hcl` file (blocks as Terraform addresses; prefixed and declared-set bare references; local module sources draw directory dependencies) |
| Ansible    | `ansible.cfg` or a `roles/` directory beside plays (plays → roles by name; `include_role`/`import_role`; templates counted, never rendered) |
| AsyncAPI   | any AsyncAPI 2.x/3.x YAML or JSON spec (channels and producer/consumer operations → messaging topics; local `$ref` and payload-schema identity) |
| OpenAPI    | any spec with an `openapi:` / `swagger:` key |
| gRPC       | any `.proto` file (proto services → routes; TypeScript gRPC-web client calls detected) |
| GraphQL    | graphql-ruby root types (server) + gql tags, `.graphql` operation documents and Ruby operation strings (clients); operation documents activate detection without a TypeScript root |

Framework- and platform-specific detection for each language is described in **[ARCHITECTURE.md → Supported languages](ARCHITECTURE.md#supported-languages)**.

> Python, Ruby, PHP, Rust and Dart are parsed with tree-sitter and contribute call and dependency edges to the graph, so `traverse`, `find_path`, and `impact_analysis` reach into them - not just modules and routes.

## Staying current

enola releases often. It checks for a new release at most once every 12 hours, in the background, and caches the answer in `~/.enola/update.json` - no command ever waits on the network, and a machine that is offline behaves exactly like one that is up to date. When there is a newer release, `enola check`, `enola --generate` and `enola doctor` say so in one line, and `enola upgrade` installs it.

The notice reports one thing beyond the version: whether the **extractors** changed. That is the bit worth acting on - it means snapshots taken with your build are missing facts a current enola would extract, which is a data problem rather than a housekeeping one. Your agent gets the same notice once per session over MCP, worded so it tells you rather than upgrading your machine mid-task.

It is silent for builds from source, never runs when `CI` is set, and turns off entirely with `export ENOLA_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.

## Found it useful?

If `enola --explain` told you something about your codebase you didn't already know, a star helps other people find it.

And if it missed something it should have caught - an unresolved edge, a route it didn't match, a language construct it walked past - [open an issue](https://github.com/enola-labs/enola/issues). Coverage gaps are the most useful bug reports this project gets, because `enola coverage` is built on the premise that a miss should be visible rather than quiet.

## License

Apache License 2.0 - see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

**This repository is the full engine, not a trial edition.** Nothing in it is gated, metered, or degraded without a key: there is no license check anywhere in this repository, and no snapshot, fact, or usage counter ever leaves your machine. The only outbound request enola makes is to GitHub's release API, and only when you explicitly run `enola upgrade`.

Everything ships here:

- **Every language** - Go, TypeScript/JavaScript/Vue/Svelte/Ember/Angular, Python, Java, Kotlin, Scala, Dart/Flutter, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Rust, C/C++, .NET (C#/VB.NET/F#/Razor/XAML), Terraform/HCL, Ansible, gRPC/Protobuf, OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, GraphQL
- **All 19 MCP tools**, plus the cross-repo linker
- **All nineteen explainers** - `cycles`, `layers`, `crossrepo`, `coverage`, `unused-routes`, `messaging-coverage`, `god-class`, `hotspots`, `dependency-depth`, `exported-surface`, `complexity-outliers`, `intent`, `constraints`, `domain`, `query-loops`, `entry-points`, `dead-methods`, `vendored-candidates`, `import-closure`
- Baselines, `diff_snapshot`, snapshot receipts, the `--explain` report, and the localhost dashboard
