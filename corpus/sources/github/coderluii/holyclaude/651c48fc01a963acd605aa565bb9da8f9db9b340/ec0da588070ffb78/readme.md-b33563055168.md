### Stop configuring. Start building.

One command. Full AI development workstation. Claude Code, web UI, headless browser, 8 AI CLIs, 50+ dev tools — containerized and ready.

**You were going to spend 2 hours setting this up manually. Or you could just `docker compose up`.**

**Works with your existing Claude Code subscription.** Max/Pro plan, API key — whatever you have, it just works.

> [!TIP]
> **Stop maintaining. Start building.**
>
> A hosted AI workstation. Always-on Linux box.
>
> [holycode.cloud](https://holycode.cloud/?ref=hclaude-readme)

## What is this?

You know the drill. You want Claude Code. But you also want it in a browser. With a headless browser for screenshots and testing. With Playwright configured. With every AI CLI. With TypeScript, Python, deployment tools, database clients, GitHub CLI.

v1.6.0 refreshes the workstation tools and adds nano, ShellCheck, yq, DNS utilities, MySQL-compatible clients, Python testing tools and Atuin. Your `.bash_aliases` now persists with the managed CLI state. If a broad home-directory mount hides Claude's executable, startup points you to recovery steps that preserve your existing files.

Release-sensitive facts are also published in [`contracts/product-facts.json`](contracts/product-facts.json). The release workflow checks that contract against the Dockerfile and Compose files before building images.

So you start installing things. One by one. Then Chromium won't launch because Docker's shared memory is 64MB. Then Xvfb isn't configured. Then the UID inside the container doesn't match your host and everything is permission denied. Then you realize Claude Code's installer hangs when WORKDIR is root-owned. Then SQLite locks on your NAS mount. Then—

**HolyClaude is the container I built after solving every single one of those problems.**

I've been running this daily on my own server for weeks. Every bug has been hit, diagnosed, and fixed. Every edge case has been handled. Every "why doesn't this work in Docker" has been answered.

You pull it. You run it. You open your browser. You build.

### :credit_card: Use Your Existing Subscription

**This runs the real Claude Code CLI.** Not a wrapper. Not a proxy. Not a knock-off.

Your existing Anthropic account works directly:
- **Claude Max/Pro plan** — authenticate through the web UI (OAuth), same as desktop Claude Code
- **Anthropic API key** — set it through the web UI, same billing as always
- **No extra cost** — HolyClaude is free and open source. You only pay Anthropic for what you use, like you already do.

> HolyClaude operates no credential relay. Bundled tools read credentials from container files, bind mounts, or environment variables, then contact the providers you configure directly.

## :zap: Quick Start

**1.** Create a folder for HolyClaude:

```bash
mkdir holyclaude && cd holyclaude
```

**2.** Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file. Copy one of the templates below:
- [Quick template](#whale-docker-compose--quick) — minimal, zero config, just works
- [Full template](#whale2-docker-compose--full) — all options, fully documented

**3.** Pull and start:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**4.** Open the web UI:

```
http://localhost:3001
```

**5.** Create a CloudCLI account (takes 10 seconds), sign in with your Anthropic account, and you're live.

> No `.env` files. No pre-configuration. No reading 40 pages of docs before you can start. It just runs.

> **Want to reach it from outside your network?** Don't port-forward it. See [Remote Access & Exposure](#shield-remote-access--exposure) — use Tailscale or Cloudflare Tunnel instead.

## :star2: Why HolyClaude

I built this because I was tired of re-doing the same setup every time. Installing Claude Code, wiring up a web UI, configuring Chromium in Docker, fixing permission issues, debugging process supervision. Every time.

So I made a container that does all of it. And then I hit every possible bug so you don't have to.

| | HolyClaude | Doing it yourself |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | 30 seconds | 1-2 hours (if it goes well) |
| **Claude Code** | Pre-installed, pre-configured, ready | Install, configure, debug installer hanging, fix WORKDIR |
| **Web UI** | CloudCLI included with plugins | Find a web UI, install it, configure it, wire it to Claude |
| **Headless browser** | Chromium + Xvfb + Playwright, configured | Install Chromium, install Xvfb, configure display :99, fix shm, fix sandbox, fix seccomp... |
| **AI CLIs** | 8 providers, one container | Install each one separately across 3 package managers |
| **Dev tools** | 50+ tools, ready | `apt-get install` / `npm i -g` / `pip install` for the next hour |
| **Process management** | s6-overlay (auto-restart, graceful shutdown) | Write your own supervisord config or hope Docker restart works |
| **Persistence** | Bind-mounted tool config and workspace survive rebuilds | Figure out Docker volumes, debug "why is this a directory not a file" |
| **Updates** | `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` | Update 50 tools manually, pray nothing breaks |
| **Multi-arch** | AMD64 + ARM64 | Pray your Dockerfile builds on ARM |

**The last row of every manual setup is "works on my machine."** HolyClaude works on every machine.

## :credit_card: Subscription & Authentication

HolyClaude runs the **official Claude Code CLI** from Anthropic. Your existing account works out of the box.

### What works:

| Authentication method | How | Cost |
|----------------------|-----|------|
| **Claude Max/Pro plan** (subscription) | Sign in through CloudCLI web UI — same OAuth flow as desktop | Your existing subscription, no extra charge |
| **Anthropic API key** | Paste your API key in the web UI | Pay-per-use, same Anthropic billing |

### What doesn't work:

| | Why |
|---|---|
| OpenAI API key for Claude | Different company, different API. OpenAI keys work with the **Codex CLI** (also pre-installed) |

> **ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscribers:** Your subscription works with the **Codex CLI**. Run `codex login --device-auth` inside the container to authenticate with your ChatGPT account. If you need Codex's browser callback flow from your host, expose port `1455` in the full compose template below.

### Other AI CLIs included:

| CLI | What you need |
|-----|--------------|
| Gemini CLI | Google AI API key (`GEMINI_API_KEY`) |
| OpenAI Codex | OpenAI API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) or ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription (`codex login --device-auth`) |
| Cursor | Cursor API key (`CURSOR_API_KEY`) |
| TaskMaster AI | Uses your AI provider keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) |
| Junie | JetBrains account (JetBrains AI subscription) |
| OpenCode | Configure via `opencode` TUI (OpenRouter and other providers) |
| Pi Coding Agent | Configure through `pi` (supports multiple providers) |

> **HolyClaude is free and open source.** You only pay your AI providers for usage, same as you already do. HolyClaude does not relay provider credentials. Bundled tools read them from container files, bind mounts, or environment variables and contact providers directly.

## :package: Image Variants

Two flavors. Same quality. Pick your weight class.

| Tag | What you get | Best for | Docker Hub compressed size |
|-----|-------------|----------|----------------------------|
| **`latest`** | Everything pre-installed — every tool, every library, every CLI | Most users. Zero wait time. Claude never has to stop and install something. | [Check by architecture](https://hub.docker.com/r/coderluii/holyclaude/tags?name=latest) |
| **`slim`** | Core tools only — Claude installs extras on-demand | Smaller VPS, limited disk, metered bandwidth | [Check by architecture](https://hub.docker.com/r/coderluii/holyclaude/tags?name=slim) |
| `X.Y.Z` | Full image, pinned version | Production stability — you control when to update | Same as `latest` for that release |
| `X.Y.Z-slim` | Slim image, pinned version | Production + small footprint | Same as `slim` for that release |

```bash
# Full — batteries included (recommended)
docker pull coderluii/holyclaude

# Slim — lean and mean
docker pull coderluii/holyclaude:slim
```

> **`latest` is always the full image.** Slim users: don't worry — when you ask Claude to do something that needs a missing tool, it installs it in seconds. You get the same capabilities, just with a smaller initial download.
>
> Download size varies by release and architecture; check the matching tag on Docker Hub. It reports compressed transfer size. Docker, Synology Container Manager, and NAS filesystems can show a larger unpacked size after layers are extracted. Use `slim` when disk space or bandwidth matters more than having every tool ready on first boot.

## :whale: Docker Compose — Quick

The "I just want it running" template. Copy this entire block into a `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
# ==============================================================================
# HolyClaude — Quick Start
# Just run: docker compose up -d
# Then open: http://localhost:3001
# ==============================================================================

services:
  holyclaude:
    image: coderluii/holyclaude:latest     # Full image (use :slim for smaller download)
    container_name: holyclaude
    hostname: holyclaude
    restart: unless-stopped
    shm_size: 2g                           # Retained browser default for this release
    network_mode: bridge
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN                          # Current browser profile for this release; hardening is separate
      - SYS_PTRACE                         # Debugging-related capability
    security_opt:
      - seccomp=unconfined                 # Current browser profile for this release; hardening is separate
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3001:3001"              # CloudCLI web UI, localhost only
    volumes:
      #
      # ./data/claude — Your settings, credentials, API keys, and Claude's memory.
      #                  This is what survives container rebuilds.
      #                  NEVER delete this folder — your auth lives here.
      #
      - ./data/claude:/home/claude/.claude
      #
      # ./workspace — Your code. All projects go here.
      #               Bind-mounted so you can access files from your host.
      #
      - ./workspace:/workspace
    environment:
      - TZ=UTC                             # Your timezone (e.g., America/New_York, Europe/London)
```

Then:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:3001`. Create a CloudCLI account. Sign in with your Anthropic account. Build something.

**That's the whole setup. You're done.**

> **Why these browser caps?** This release keeps HolyClaude's current browser container profile in place. Chromium does not universally require `SYS_ADMIN`, `SYS_PTRACE`, or `seccomp=unconfined`, and `SYS_PTRACE` is debugging-related. Keep the web UI bound to `127.0.0.1` unless you put a real private tunnel or access layer in front of it. Treat any hardening pass as a separate change.

> **Why `shm_size: 2g`?** Docker gives containers 64MB of shared memory by default. HolyClaude keeps 2GB as the retained browser default for this release because Chromium uses `/dev/shm` heavily for tab rendering. At 64MB, tabs crash randomly. For heavy browser use (many tabs, complex pages), increase to 4GB.

Then:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you want to change the host-side port or bind-mount paths without editing compose, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set:

```dotenv
HOLYCLAUDE_HOST_PORT=3003
HOLYCLAUDE_HOST_CLAUDE_DIR=./data/claude
HOLYCLAUDE_HOST_WORKSPACE_DIR=./workspace
```

These values are read by Docker Compose on the host. They are not container environment variables.

### What each section controls:

| Section | What it does | When to change it |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Timezone** | Container clock | Always — set to your local TZ |
| **Performance** | Node.js memory ceiling | Only if you hit OOM errors on large projects |
| **User mapping** | File permissions between container and host | Docker users: match `id -u` and `id -g`. Rootless Podman users: use the Podman compose file below. |
| **SMB/CIFS** | File watcher polling mode | Only if your volumes live on a NAS or network share |
| **Notifications** | Push alerts via Apprise (Discord, Telegram, Slack, Email, 100+ services) | If you want to walk away and know when your AI agents are done |
| **AI providers** | API keys for Gemini, Codex, Cursor, Junie, OpenCode | If you want to use AI CLIs other than Claude |

> **Every single environment variable is optional.** The container runs perfectly with just `TZ=UTC`. Everything else has sensible defaults or is handled through the web UI.

## :robot: AI CLI Providers

The full image ships eight AI CLIs. The slim image ships the five core CLIs.

| Provider | Command | How to authenticate | Subscription works? |
|----------|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Claude Code** | `claude` | CloudCLI web UI (OAuth) | **Yes** — Max/Pro plan or API key |
| **Gemini CLI** | `gemini` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` env var | API key (pay-per-use) |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `codex` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `codex login --device-auth` | **Yes** — ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Team/Enterprise or API key |
| **Cursor** | `cursor` | `CURSOR_API_KEY` env var | API key |
| **TaskMaster AI** | `task-master` | Uses existing AI provider keys | Works with configured keys |
| **Junie** | `junie` | JetBrains AI subscription | JetBrains account required, full image only |
| **OpenCode** | `opencode` | Configure via TUI | OpenRouter and other providers, full image only |
| **Pi Coding Agent** | `pi` | Configure through Pi | Supports multiple providers, full image only |

> Claude Code is the primary CLI. The others are there because sometimes you want a second opinion, or a specific model's strengths, or you're comparing outputs. Having all of them one `Tab` away is the whole point.

OpenCode is the full-image path for [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs/cookbook/coding-agents/opencode-integration) and multi-provider model routing. Configure it inside `opencode`; free model availability depends on OpenRouter and provider account limits, not HolyClaude.

## :mag: Desloppify

Desloppify ships in both images as the `desloppify` command. It is passive by default. HolyClaude does not run scans, create `.desloppify/`, edit `.gitignore`, or change your mounted workspace unless you run Desloppify yourself.

Use it inside a project:

```bash
desloppify scan --path .
desloppify next
```

After you use scans in a project, add `.desloppify/` to that project's `.gitignore`.

Optional global skill setup is controlled by `HOLYCLAUDE_DESLOPPIFY_SETUP`.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `off` | Default. No global skill setup. The CLI is still installed. |
| `claude` | Runs `desloppify setup --interface claude` at container start. |
| `codex` | Runs `desloppify setup --interface codex` at container start. |
| `gemini` | Runs `desloppify setup --interface gemini` at container start. |
| `all` | Expands to `claude,codex,gemini`. |
| `claude,codex` | Any comma-separated subset of `claude`, `codex`, and `gemini`. |
| `opencode` | Full image only. Sets up the OpenCode-native global skill path. |

OpenCode can also discover Claude-compatible skills from `~/.claude/skills`, so `all` does not include `opencode`. Do not combine `claude` and `opencode` in automatic setup; HolyClaude warns and skips `opencode` to avoid duplicate skill discovery. If `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` is set, HolyClaude also skips automatic OpenCode setup because Desloppify writes to the standard `~/.config/opencode` path.

Desloppify also supports these manual upstream targets if you want to configure them yourself: `cursor`, `copilot`, `windsurf`, `qwen`, `amp`, `rovodev`, `droid`, and `hermes`.

## :llama: Using Ollama

HolyClaude works with [Ollama](https://ollama.com) as an alternative to an Anthropic subscription. The supported setup path is `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=ollama` plus `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=<your Ollama endpoint>`.

See the full setup guide: **[docs/ollama.md](docs/ollama.md)**

```

### How the pieces fit together

1. **Container starts** — `entrypoint.sh` runs as root for Docker and remaps UID/GID there. In rootless Podman keep-id mode, it skips root-only repairs because the container is already running as the target user. In both paths it restores the saved Claude Code session and prepares persistent Git and GitHub CLI configuration before checking if this is a first boot.

2. **Every boot** — HolyClaude links global Git config, XDG Git config, and GitHub CLI config into the existing `.claude` mount. Missing identity values are seeded without replacing manual changes.

3. **First boot only** — `bootstrap.sh` copies default settings and the memory template, then creates `.holyclaude-bootstrapped`. Your customizations are safe from that point on.

4. **s6-overlay takes over as PID 1** — This isn't supervisord. It's [s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay), purpose-built for Docker. Supervises CloudCLI, Xvfb, Claude session sync, and optional `sshd` when you explicitly enable it. Auto-restarts on crash. Forwards signals. Reaps zombies. Shuts down gracefully.

5. **CloudCLI serves the web UI** — Port 3001. Browser-based interface to Claude Code with project management, multiple sessions, and plugins (project stats + web terminal included).

6. **Xvfb provides a compatibility display** — Xvfb stays available at `:99` for tools that use a headed display. Modern headless Chromium, Playwright, and Lighthouse do not universally require Xvfb.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full technical deep-dive — including why we chose s6 over supervisord, why plugins are baked into the image, and why `runuser` instead of `su`.

## :floppy_disk: Data & Persistence

| What | Where (container) | Where (host) | Survives rebuild? |
|------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Claude settings and persisted tool config | `/home/claude/.claude` | `./data/claude` | **Yes** |
| Claude Code session (OAuth, onboarding) | `/home/claude/.claude.json` | `./data/claude/.claude.json.persist` | **Yes** |
| Git global and XDG configuration | `/home/claude/.gitconfig`, `/home/claude/.config/git` | `./data/claude/.gitconfig`, `./data/claude/.config/git` | **Yes** |
| GitHub CLI configuration and authentication | `/home/claude/.config/gh` | `./data/claude/.config/gh` | **Yes** |
| Bash aliases | `/home/claude/.bash_aliases` | `./data/claude/.bash_aliases` | **Yes** |
| Your code and projects | `/workspace` | `./workspace` | **Yes** |
| CloudCLI account | `/home/claude/.cloudcli` | *(container only by default — see below)* | No (opt-in available) |

HolyClaude restores the saved Claude Code session before startup can create a fresh default file. That keeps container rebuilds and recreates from replacing a real OAuth/API session with onboarding state.

### What survives `docker compose down && docker compose up`:
- File-based Anthropic authentication and Claude Code API-key settings
- Claude Code settings, memory (`CLAUDE.md`), and OAuth session (no re-login)
- All your code in `./workspace`
- Git global configuration, aliases, and XDG Git settings
- GitHub CLI configuration and authentication
- Bash aliases saved in `~/.bash_aliases`
- Codex and Gemini file-based config and authentication stored below `/home/claude/.claude` (since v1.1.7). Cursor uses `.claude/.cursor` only when HolyClaude creates the managed alias; an existing real directory or custom link remains user-managed, so inspect and migrate it before relying on `.claude` persistence. Environment-provided keys remain in your Compose or host environment.

### What you'll redo (10 seconds):
- CloudCLI web account — quick signup, that's it (unless you opt into persistence below)

### Re-triggering first-boot setup:
```bash
# Delete the sentinel file — NOT the whole folder
rm ./data/claude/.holyclaude-bootstrapped
docker compose restart holyclaude
```

> **Protect `./data/claude/`.** It contains saved Claude Code sessions and may now contain GitHub credentials in `.config/gh/hosts.yml`. Do not commit it, share it broadly, or place it in an unencrypted backup. Delete only the specific state you intend to reset.

### Persisting the CloudCLI account (optional, local storage only)

By default, the CloudCLI account database (`~/.cloudcli`) is container-local and gets wiped on rebuild. Re-creating the account takes 10 seconds, so most people leave it as-is.

CloudCLI is a single-user service. Remote access shares the same CloudCLI account, `/workspace`, and mounted credential context; it does not create separate users or tenant isolation.

If you want it to survive rebuilds, add a **named Docker volume** to your compose file:

```yaml
services:
  holyclaude:
    volumes:
      - ./data/claude:/home/claude/.claude
      - ./workspace:/workspace
      - cloudcli-data:/home/claude/.cloudcli   # add this line

volumes:
  cloudcli-data:                                # and this block
```

HolyClaude prepares this directory before CloudCLI starts. Fresh Docker volumes inherit the image's `claude:claude` ownership. Existing volumes are repaired to the configured `PUID`/`PGID` during normal root-starting Docker startup. If the mount is read-only or cannot be repaired, startup stops with the exact path and UID/GID instead of letting CloudCLI repeat `unable to open database file`.

For rootless Podman, use `docker-compose.podman-rootless.yaml`. Its `keep-id` mapping and `:Z` labels let the existing host user write the mounted state without a privileged ownership repair. `:Z` handles SELinux labeling; `:U` rewrites host ownership and is not the default.

> **Keep CloudCLI's SQLite database off network shares (NAS, SMB/CIFS, NFS).** Network filesystem locking can cause `database is locked` errors. Use a named volume backed by the default local driver without remote mount options, or a local-disk bind mount. A volume name alone does not guarantee local storage; remote drivers and NFS/CIFS options still place the database on a network share.

A bind mount to a local SSD path is fine too, just keep it off any network share.

## :lock: Permissions

Claude Code runs in **`acceptEdits`** mode by default. This is the shipped setting:

| Action | Allowed? |
|--------|----------|
| Read files | Yes |
| Edit / create files | Yes |
| Run shell commands | Depends on Claude Code's current permission prompt |
| Install packages | Depends on Claude Code's current permission prompt |

### Want full bypass? (power users)

This is how I personally run it. Edit `./data/claude/settings.json` on your host:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "bypassPermissions"
  }
}
```

> **Bypass mode means Claude executes commands without confirmation.** It is powerful, but it can also run destructive commands quickly. Keep the shipped `acceptEdits` default unless you trust the workspace and every prompt you run.

### Codex Permission Modes

HolyClaude also ships configurable near-parity permission modes for Codex, with separate controls for CloudCLI Codex chat and the raw `codex` CLI.

| Setting | Applies to | Default | When it is read |
|---------|------------|---------|-----------------|
| `HOLYCLAUDE_CODEX_CHAT_PERMISSION_MODE` | CloudCLI Codex requests that omit `permissionMode` | `acceptEdits` fallback | Runtime container config, used only when the request has no explicit value |
| `HOLYCLAUDE_CODEX_CLI_PERMISSION_MODE` | Raw `codex` CLI config at `~/.codex/config.toml` | `default` | First boot only, when the file does not already exist |

Valid values for both are `default`, `acceptEdits`, and `bypassPermissions`. `acceptEdits` is the fallback recommended for trusted self-hosted workspaces. The current CloudCLI browser client sends an explicit `permissionMode`, and that request value wins. `HOLYCLAUDE_CODEX_CHAT_PERMISSION_MODE` is only the fallback for direct WebSocket/API clients or custom frontends that omit it. For the raw `codex` CLI, `default` is the first-boot default; the setting only seeds a new `~/.codex/config.toml`, existing configs are not overwritten, and the generated value persists until you edit that file yourself.

`bypassPermissions` maps Codex to full access with no approval. Inside Docker, that still runs within the container and mounted volumes, but it can read and change anything reachable through those mounts, especially `/workspace` and persisted config under `/home/claude`. Use it only for trusted local workspaces, and don't expose CloudCLI directly to the public internet.

  <a href="#top">↑ back to top</a>

## :shield: Remote Access & Exposure

HolyClaude binds CloudCLI to `127.0.0.1:3001` by default. That keeps the web UI on the Docker host only, which is right for a laptop or a home server you reach over SSH.

**The moment you want to reach it from outside your network, read this section.**

### Don't port-forward it to the public internet

I'll say it flat out: do not punch a hole in your router and expose `3001` to the open internet. Not even with a password. Here's why:

- CloudCLI exposes a full shell through the web terminal plugin
- It can run arbitrary code, install packages, and read/write your mounted `/workspace`
- It holds your Anthropic OAuth tokens and API keys
- Basic auth / app-level passwords get brute-forced, credential-stuffed, and scraped out of logs
- One leaked password = someone else has a paid Claude Code instance running on your box with your money

A password is a speed bump, not a door. Treat HolyClaude like you'd treat an SSH session: never on the open internet without a proper tunnel in front of it.

### Use a proper tunnel instead

These are the two options I actually recommend:

| Option | Who it's for | Why |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| **[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)** | Personal use, small teams | WireGuard mesh VPN. Install Tailscale on your server + your laptop/phone, and you reach `http://holyclaude:3001` from anywhere as if you were on the LAN. No ports opened, no DNS, no certs. Free for personal use. |
| **[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)** | Sharing with others, public hostname | Cloudflare proxies the connection, so port `3001` stays closed. You get a real domain with HTTPS, and you can put Cloudflare Access (Google/GitHub SSO) in front of it. Free tier covers most personal use. |

Both avoid forwarding HolyClaude's application port through your router. Tailscale provides encrypted mesh transport and identity controls. Cloudflare Tunnel provides encrypted transport to Cloudflare's edge; configure Cloudflare Access separately when you need identity-based access controls and Access audit logs.

### Tailscale subpath mounts

If you mount HolyClaude below a path, set the same path inside the container:

```yaml
environment:
  - HOLYCLAUDE_BASE_PATH=/holyclaude
```

Then publish that path with Tailscale Serve:

```bash
sudo tailscale serve --bg --https=443 --set-path=/holyclaude http://127.0.0.1:3001
```

Use no trailing slash in `HOLYCLAUDE_BASE_PATH`. If you serve HolyClaude at the hostname root, leave this unset.

### Optional SSH and Mosh

HolyClaude also ships `sshd` and Mosh for people who want a direct terminal from a phone, laptop, NAS, or VPN connection. It is off by default. Nothing listens on port `22` unless you enable it.

This is a remote shell into the same container that holds your `/workspace` and Claude state. Treat it like SSH to your dev box:

- key-only login as `claude`
- no password auth
- no root login
- no `authorized_keys` under `.claude` or `/workspace`
- no public internet port forwarding

Safe setup shape:

```yaml
services:
  holyclaude:
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:2222:22"
      - "127.0.0.1:60000-60010:60000-60010/udp"
    volumes:
      - ./data/ssh/authorized_keys:/run/holyclaude-ssh/authorized_keys:ro
      - holyclaude-ssh:/var/lib/holyclaude-ssh
    environment:
      - HOLYCLAUDE_SSH_ENABLE=true
      - HOLYCLAUDE_MOSH_ENABLE=true

volumes:
  holyclaude-ssh:
```

Prepare the public key file on the host:

```bash
mkdir -p data/ssh
cp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub data/ssh/authorized_keys
```

Connect over SSH:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 claude@127.0.0.1
```

Connect over Mosh when UDP is reachable:

```bash
mosh --ssh="ssh -p 2222" -p 60000:60010 claude@127.0.0.1
```

Bind those ports to localhost, a VPN interface, or a firewall-restricted address. If you change `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0`, you are taking responsibility for that exposure.

### If you insist on exposing it directly (please don't)

If you absolutely have to skip the tunnel (self-hosting tutorial, isolated lab network, whatever), at the very minimum:

1. **Put a reverse proxy in front of it** (Caddy, nginx, Traefik) with real TLS
2. **Add IP allowlisting** at the firewall or proxy level — only your known IPs
3. **Keep the shipped `acceptEdits` default** unless you have a clear reason to use `bypassPermissions`
4. **Rotate your Anthropic credentials** if anything looks off
5. **Run behind Cloudflare Access or similar SSO**, not basic auth

Even with all that, the risk surface is huge. Use Tailscale or Cloudflare Tunnel. They're free, they take five minutes to set up, and they're what I personally use.

## :bell: Notifications

Walk away from your computer and know when a task is done. Claude Code hooks, raw CLI hooks for Codex and Gemini CLI, and CloudCLI Codex chat completion/failure events use the same [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) setup. Apprise supports 100+ services including Discord, Telegram, Slack, Email, Pushover, Gotify, and more.

**To enable:**

1. Add one or more `NOTIFY_*` variables to your compose `environment`:
   ```yaml
   - NOTIFY_DISCORD=discord://webhook_id/webhook_token
   - NOTIFY_TELEGRAM=tgram://bot_token/chat_id
   ```
2. Inside the container: `touch ~/.claude/notify-on`

Telegram uses Apprise's `tgram://` scheme. Legacy Telegram values are still accepted, but new setups should use `tgram://`.

Test the setup without sending a message:
```bash
docker compose exec holyclaude /usr/local/bin/notify.py test --dry-run --debug
```

See [configuration docs](docs/configuration.md#notifications-apprise) for all supported variables and URL formats.

**To disable:** `rm ~/.claude/notify-on`

**Events that trigger notifications:**
| Event | What happened |
|-------|--------------|
| `stop` | Claude Code hooks, raw CLI hooks for Codex and Gemini CLI, or a CloudCLI Codex chat run finished |
| `error` | A Claude Code hook, raw CLI hook, or CloudCLI Codex chat run failed |

> Completely silent when not configured. No `NOTIFY_*` vars set? No flag file? Zero network calls. Zero log spam. Zero overhead.

## :arrows_counterclockwise: Upgrading

> Upgrading from a version before v1.5.5? If the current container holds `git config --global` or `gh auth` state that is not already in `./data/claude`, migrate it before recreating the container. Follow [Git and GitHub CLI recovery](docs/troubleshooting.md#git-identity-or-gh-auth-disappears-after-recreate). Removing the old container first can discard that state.

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker compose pull

# Recreate the container with the new image
docker compose up -d
```

Your data persists in `./data/claude` and `./workspace` — upgrading only replaces the container, not your files.

Do not update CloudCLI inside the container with `cloudcli update` or `npm install -g @cloudcli-ai/cloudcli@latest`. HolyClaude ships a patched CloudCLI runtime, so the supported update path is the Docker image:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

To pin a specific version instead of `latest`:

```yaml
image: coderluii/holyclaude:1.5.5   # instead of :latest
```

## :construction: Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>CloudCLI shows wrong default directory</strong></summary>

CloudCLI opens to `/home/claude` instead of `/workspace`.

**Cause:** A custom or modified CloudCLI service script did not set `WORKSPACES_ROOT=/workspace` before launching CloudCLI.

**Fix:** Already handled in HolyClaude. The s6 run script uses `with-contenv`, exports `WORKSPACES_ROOT=/workspace`, then starts CloudCLI as the `claude` user.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>CloudCLI says "Failed to browse filesystem"</strong></summary>

CloudCLI cannot open `~`, `/workspace`, or a broad NAS mount such as `/volume2/docker:/workspace`.

**Cause:** HolyClaude `1.3.3` could remove CloudCLI's `expandWorkspacePath` helper while disabling CloudCLI's in-container self-update path.

**Fix:** Update to HolyClaude `1.3.4` or newer:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Broad NAS mounts work, but `/workspace` is the CloudCLI boundary. Anything readable under that mount is visible to authenticated CloudCLI users. Use a narrower project mount when you do not want the whole NAS folder tree exposed inside CloudCLI.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>CloudCLI Web Terminal shows black squares or missing characters</strong></summary>

The Web Terminal output is hard to read. Box drawing, emoji, CJK text, or CLI banners may show as black squares or broken characters.

**Cause:** Older images built the CloudCLI Web Terminal plugin with string-based PTY output handling and a narrow xterm.js font stack. If a multibyte character was split between PTY chunks, or if WebGL picked a weak fallback font, terminal output could render as replacement blocks.

**Fix:** Update to HolyClaude `1.3.5` or newer:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

HolyClaude now patches the baked Web Terminal plugin before it is built. If your browser still shows black squares after updating, open browser DevTools on the CloudCLI page, run this once, then reopen the Web Terminal:

```js
localStorage.setItem('web-terminal-disable-webgl', 'true')
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>SQLite "database is locked"</strong></summary>

**Cause:** SQLite databases on SMB/CIFS network mounts. CIFS doesn't support the file-level locking SQLite requires.

**Fix:** Don't store SQLite databases on network shares. HolyClaude keeps `.cloudcli` in container-local storage for exactly this reason. If you have your own SQLite databases in `/workspace` on a NAS, move them to a local path.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Chromium crashes / blank pages / tab failures</strong></summary>

**Cause:** Usually insufficient shared memory. Docker defaults to 64MB. If the process exits immediately with SIGTRAP or exit 133, treat that as a separate browser/runtime failure instead of a shared-memory symptom.

**Fix:** Ensure `shm_size: 2g` in your compose file. For heavy browser use (many tabs, complex pages), increase to `4g`. If you still get an immediate SIGTRAP, re-check the browser build path before only raising shm.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>File watchers not detecting changes (hot reload broken)</strong></summary>

**Cause:** SMB/CIFS network mounts don't support `inotify`.

**Fix:** Enable polling in your compose environment:
```yaml
- CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=1
- WATCHFILES_FORCE_POLLING=true
```
Note: Polling uses more CPU than inotify. Only enable on network mounts.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Permission denied errors</strong></summary>

**Cause:** Container UID/GID doesn't match host file ownership.

**Fix for Docker:**
```bash
# On your host machine
id -u  # → this is your PUID
id -g  # → this is your PGID
```
Set them in your compose file:
```yaml
- PUID=1000
- PGID=1000
```

**Rootless Podman on SELinux:** `PUID`/`PGID` changes the container user, but rootless Podman still maps container IDs through your subordinate UID/GID range unless you use `keep-id`. Use the Podman profile instead:

```bash
mkdir -p data/claude data/cloudcli workspace
podman compose -f docker-compose.podman-rootless.yaml up -d
```

That file uses `userns_mode: "keep-id:uid=1000,gid=1000"` and `:Z` labels. Do not add `:U` to `/workspace`; it rewrites host ownership and can make host editing worse.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Docker creates .claude.json as a directory</strong></summary>

**Cause:** If a bind-mount target file doesn't exist before container start, Docker helpfully creates it as a directory. Thanks, Docker.

**Fix:** Already handled — `entrypoint.sh` restores the saved session file first, or creates a safe default file when no saved session exists.
</details>

## :warning: Known Issues

These are not HolyClaude bugs — they're upstream issues or intentional trade-offs.

| Issue | Why | Workaround |
|-------|-----|------------|
| "Continue in Shell" button broken | CloudCLI upstream bug (race condition in terminal init) | Use the **Web Terminal** plugin instead (pre-installed) |
| Cursor CLI "Command timeout" | No API key configured — cosmetic only, doesn't affect anything | Set `CURSOR_API_KEY` or ignore |
| CloudCLI account lost on rebuild | `.cloudcli` is container-local by default | Add the documented local named volume, or re-create the account (~10 seconds) |
| Web push notifications "not supported" | Browser limitation in CloudCLI, standard behavior | Use Apprise notifications instead (see [Notifications](#bell-notifications)) |

## :hammer_and_wrench: Building Locally

Want to build the image yourself instead of pulling from Docker Hub? Go for it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoderLuii/HolyClaude.git
cd holyclaude

# Build full image
docker build -t holyclaude .

# Build slim image
docker build --build-arg VARIANT=slim -t holyclaude:slim .

# Build for ARM (Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi, AWS Graviton)
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t holyclaude .
```

This source release vendors the patched CloudCLI package under `vendor/artifacts/`, so `docker build` installs that bundled `@cloudcli-ai/cloudcli` tarball instead of downloading a moved package from npm.

Then use `image: holyclaude` instead of `image: coderluii/holyclaude:latest` in your compose file.

## :bar_chart: Alternatives

How does HolyClaude compare to other approaches?

| Approach | Web UI | Multi-AI | Pre-configured tools | Headless browser | One command setup | Persistence |
|----------|--------|----------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **HolyClaude** | CloudCLI | 8 CLIs | 50+ tools | Chromium + Xvfb + Playwright | `docker compose up` | Bind mounts |
| Claude Code (bare metal) | No | No | Install yourself | Install yourself | Multi-step install | Manual |
| Claude Code + oh-my-openagent | No | Yes (multi-model) | Some | No | npm install | Manual |
| DIY Docker + Claude Code | Maybe | Maybe | Whatever you add | If you configure it | If you write the Dockerfile | If you set up volumes |
| Cursor IDE | Built-in | Cursor only | IDE-bundled | No | Download app | App data |

HolyClaude isn't competing with coding agents — it's the **infrastructure layer** that makes them all work better. It's the container you run them inside.
