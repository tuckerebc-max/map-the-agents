# Agents

repomon runs every agent the same way (each in its own durable session window), but it learns each agent's *status*
differently, because each CLI stores its session state differently.

## How agents run

When you spawn an agent (New Lane, the `e` key, or `agent.spawn`), the daemon launches its CLI in a window named
`lane-<id>` inside the configured session (default `repomon`). On macOS/Linux that window is a tmux window:

```
tmux new-window -t repomon -n lane-7 -c <worktree> '<agent-binary> [task]'
```

On **Windows** there is no tmux: the daemon spawns a detached host process, `repomon-agent-host.exe`, per window
(`\\.\pipe\repomon-<session>-<window>`). The host owns a ConPTY child and a server-side terminal emulator with
scrollback, and it plays the exact durability role tmux plays on Unix. Either way the daemon reads output with
`capture_named` (`capture-pane` / host `capture`), sends input with `send_*` (`send-keys` / host `send_text`), and
attach hands you the raw session. Because the session backend owns the process (a tmux server or a detached host), the
agent survives the daemon and the TUI. The spawned kind is recorded on the lane so repomon can identify it later.

Several agents can share a worktree. Further spawns or adoptions take slots `lane-<id>-2`, `lane-<id>-3`, and so on,
alongside the first agent. Fleet and sidebar show an `×N` badge. In Split/Focus, Tab and Shift+Tab select the agent that
receives input and attach.

### Initial tasks and spawn warnings

`agent.spawn` passes an initial task as a launch argument when the runtime supports it. Claude and Codex receive a `--`
separator before the positional prompt. This boundary prevents Claude's trailing variadic `--allowedTools` option from
consuming the task as another tool name. OpenCode and Antigravity use their respective prompt flags. Hermes remains on
the typed-input path because its single-turn query mode exits instead of keeping the interactive session alive.

Typed task delivery or recovery waits for an empty, idle composer with no detected dialog, usage-limit menu, or active
spinner. Startup polling has an eight-second budget. The daemon checks the first 40 task characters in the pane,
normalizing ANSI escapes and whitespace, and attempts argument-delivery recovery once when confirmation is missing.
Typed recovery uses a paste buffer on tmux and checks the opening text before submission. A retry requires an empty,
ready composer; a partially filled composer is not blindly overwritten or given a duplicate task.

The RPC result includes `spawn_warnings` when task delivery or slash-command effort input cannot be confirmed. A warning
means the agent was launched but its initial input needs inspection. The MCP spawn result preserves these warnings in
its text, and the desktop keeps them visible while disabling another spawn from that completed dialog. Inspect the
agent before resending the task. A hidden or collapsed prompt can produce a conservative warning even if its contents
arrived intact.

An effort setting available only as a slash command is applied when the launched session is idle. The initial task uses
its launch effort; if the session remains busy through the startup budget, the result warns that the slash setting was
not confirmed and should be applied when the agent is idle.

## Choosing an agent

New Lane lists the **auto-detected** built-ins (claude-code / codex / hermes / opencode / antigravity / aider / cursor,
marked available if on PATH) plus any **custom agents** you define - cycle them with Tab (Shift+Tab to go back). The
**default** agent (marked default) is preselected.

### Multiple Claude accounts

Claude keeps each account's data in a config dir (`~/.claude` by default; a second account is typically run with
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-work`). repomon scans for these - the default `~/.claude` plus any `~/.claude-*` holding a
`projects/` dir, and `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` - and offers **one agent per account**: `claude-code` (default) and e.g.
`claude-work` (→ `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-work claude`). No custom config needed. Detection and adopt are
account-aware: a work-account session is read from `~/.claude-work/projects` and adopting it resumes against that
account. (A shell *alias* like `claude-work` isn't a real binary, so a custom agent pointing at `claude-work` won't
launch - use the autodetected entry instead.)

## Managing agents in-app

Press **`A`** from Fleet (or **`Ctrl+A`** from New Lane) to open the agent manager:

| Key | Agent manager action |
|---|---|
| `n` | Add a custom agent name and launch command, run in the lane worktree. Tab switches fields; Enter saves. |
| `e` | Edit a custom agent, including its name; built-ins are read-only. |
| `d` | Delete the selected custom agent. |
| `*` | Set or clear the default agent; built-ins may be defaults too. |

Changes are written straight to `~/.config/repomon/config.toml`. You can still hand-edit it:

```toml
# ~/.config/repomon/config.toml
default_agent = "claude-yolo"

[agents]
claude-yolo = "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"
claude-resume = "claude --continue"
```

> Note: editing agents in-app rewrites `config.toml` via the serializer, so hand-added
> comments in that file are not preserved.

`agent.detect` returns the combined list (with a `default` flag); `agent.add` / `agent.remove` / `agent.set_default`
mutate the config and persist it; `agent.spawn` resolves a chosen name to its custom command (if any) or the built-in
binary, appends an optional task, and runs it.

## Interacting

Attach opens the native terminal; insert mode sends keystrokes while keeping the TUI visible.

### Open it as a real terminal (the native way) - `↵`/`Right arrow`/`a`

Pressing **`↵`** (Split/Grid), or **`↵` / `Right arrow` / `a`** (Focus), **attaches** to the agent's own tmux pane. This
is a *genuine terminal* - there is **no difference** from running the agent in a plain terminal window: native wheel
scrolling and scrollback, character-precise mouse selection, **⌘V image paste** straight into Claude, full color, every
key.

**To come back to repomon, press `F12`** (single key) - or `Ctrl-b d`, or `Ctrl-b q`. A thin status bar along the bottom
of the attached pane always shows this. Detaching leaves the agent **running in the background**; don't type `exit` or
`Ctrl-C` unless you actually want to end it.

repomon configures its tmux server to feel native: `mouse on` (wheel scroll + drag-select), `set-clipboard on` (OSC-52
passthrough), a 50k-line scrollback, drag-select copies straight to the system clipboard via `pbcopy`, and a status bar
showing the detach key. Because you're in the real process, anything the agent supports in a terminal - including image
paste - works exactly as it would standalone.

> Why attach rather than emulate? The in-app view is a `capture-pane` *picture* plus
> `send-keys`; it can't carry a nested terminal's scroll wheel or real clipboard-image paste.
> Attaching hands you the actual PTY, so the focused agent is indistinguishable from native.

#### On Windows

There is no tmux to hand off, so attach works in two layers. The **embedded focus view** renders the agent from the
host's server-side terminal (`capture` + `cursor` + `alternate_on`) and forwards input the same way it does on Unix. For
a genuine terminal, `↵`/`Right arrow`/`a` **pops out** the agent into a new Windows Terminal tab running `repomon
attach-host <window>`, a raw byte proxy that subscribes to the host's byte stream (`subscribe_bytes`), pipes your
keystrokes back, and tracks console resizes. Because a subscribed connection ignores client frames, the attach client
opens a second control connection for input and resize while the first streams the pane. **Press `F12` to detach**
(tmux-parity); detaching leaves the agent running in its host process. If Windows Terminal (`wt.exe`) is not available
the client falls back to a new console window.

### Quick mediated type - `i`

For a fast one-liner without the attach context-switch, **`i`** enters **insert** mode and forwards each keystroke via
`send-keys` - printable chars, Enter, Backspace, arrows, **Shift+Tab** (Claude's mode cycling), `Ctrl-<key>` (e.g.
`Ctrl-C`), and **`Esc`** (the agent needs it to interrupt/clear). Because `Esc` is forwarded, leave insert with
**`Ctrl-O`**. **Option/Alt + Arrow** (word jump) and **Alt + Backspace** (word delete) forward too - set Terminal.app →
Profiles → Keyboard → "Use Option as Meta key". This view is a snapshot, so:

- **Scroll back** with **`PgUp`/`PgDn`** (work in both modes; always reach repomon). Typing or `↵`/`esc`
  returns to the live tail.
- **Select & copy**: drag over lines - copied to the clipboard on release (line-granular).
- **Paste an image**: press **`v`** - repomon saves the clipboard image to a temp PNG and inserts its
  path (Claude reads images referenced by path).

For anything the snapshot can't do (precise selection, wheel scroll, ⌘V image paste), just open the real terminal with
`↵`.

`AgentKind::command()` maps kinds to binaries:

| Kind          | Binary         |
|---------------|----------------|
| `claude-code` | `claude`       |
| `codex`       | `codex`        |
| `hermes`      | `hermes chat --tui` |
| `opencode`    | `opencode`     |
| `antigravity` | `agy`          |
| `aider`       | `aider`        |
| `cursor`      | `cursor-agent` |
| other         | the kind string itself |

## Auto-continue on usage limits

When a Claude agent hits its usage limit it prints "limit reached · resets at <time>" and stops mid-work. repomon
**auto-continues** it: a background watcher in the daemon scans each managed agent's pane (~every 20 s), and when it
sees the blocking message it schedules a resume - at the parsed reset time (+60 s), or on a 5-minute periodic retry if
the time can't be read - then types the continue message (`continue` + Enter). The lane shows **` rate-limited · resume
3:00 PM`** while it waits. This runs even with the TUI closed, so durable agents you left running get resumed on their
own.

- **On by default** for every repomon-managed agent. The transcript doesn't record limit info, so
  detection reads the tmux pane; the "approaching usage limit" warning never triggers it.
- **Per-lane off:** press **`C`** on a lane to disable auto-continue for it this session (it then shows
  the normal `! needs you` when paused). **Globally:** set `auto_continue = false` in `config.toml`.
  Change the typed message with `auto_continue_message` (default `"continue"`).
- **Give-up:** after 6 attempts that don't take, it stops and flags the lane **needs you** so you can
  step in.
- Only **managed** agents (with a tmux window) are touched - external sessions have no window to type
  into. The detection/parse and the state machine are pure and unit-tested (`agent/limit.rs`,
  `auto_continue.rs`).

## Usage and cost tracking

The desktop Usage view (`mod+3`) reads local transcripts into a per-turn token ledger, separately from the optional
quota probe below. Settings > Usage controls tracking and price refresh, edits model rates, and shows or hides today's
equivalent API cost in the sidebar. A reader revision recounts older sources in bounded batches; the view shows progress
until the totals settle. See [desktop.md](desktop.md#usage) for supported readers and pricing.

## Usage corner (usage probe)

With `usage_probe = true` (a Settings toggle, **off by default**), the TUI shows agent usage in the **bottom-right
corner** - e.g. `5h 38% · wk 12% · 3:00 PM` (limit windows + the soonest reset) - for the **account the focused agent
runs under**. It's provider-aware and per-account: a Claude agent shows its account's `/usage` (`~/.claude` vs
`~/.claude-work`), a Codex agent shows its `/status`; switch focus and the corner follows.

Subscription usage has no CLI flag, file, or supported endpoint - the only source is an interactive command (Claude
`/usage`, Codex `/status`). So a daemon watcher (`usage_watch.rs`), **only while a local desktop or TUI client is
active**, spawns a hidden throwaway session per account every ~5 minutes, sends the usage command, captures and parses
the pane (`agent/usage.rs`, fixture-tested), then dismisses (`Esc`) and kills the window. It never sends a model prompt.
Numbers are normalized to **% used** across agents (Codex reports "% left"); windows shown are whatever the tool reports
- Claude's 5-hour + weekly, Codex's 5-hour/weekly or (Free plan) monthly. Caveats, by design:

- It **spawns a background agent process** briefly per probe (hence opt-in). The probe window is named
  `usage-probe-…` (not `lane-…`) and runs in your home dir, so it never inflates a lane's `×N` agent
  count. The first run accepts the one-time folder-trust prompt for that dir; each probe leaves a tiny
  (promptless) transcript/session behind. Codex is probed only when it's installed (`~/.codex` exists).
- The `/usage` and `/status` layouts are undocumented and change between versions. The parsers anchor on
  labels (not positions) and return nothing rather than wrong numbers; when usage can't be read, the
  corner **falls back** to the focused lane's rate-limit countdown (` resume 3:00 PM`), or shows nothing.
  If a tool restyles its screen, recapture the fixture (`crates/repomon-core/src/agent/fixtures/`) and
  adjust the parser.

## Expanded agent rows + rename

By default a lane running several agents shows as one sidebar row with an `×N` badge. Turn on **`expand agent rows`** in
Settings (`,`) to instead show the lane as a small tree: the lane header (keeping `×N`) with one indented row per agent
- `↳ <summary>  <status>`. The summary is auto-derived (the first 1–4 words of that agent's opening prompt), and each
agent's own status glyph is shown, so you can see and select individual agents directly in the Fleet/Split sidebars.
Up/down navigate the rows; selecting an agent row makes it the active agent (Enter/focus/attach/stop/keys target it).

Press **`R`** on a selected agent row to **rename** it inline (Enter saves, Esc cancels; an empty name clears the custom
label). The label persists in the daemon keyed by the agent's transcript id, so it survives refreshes and daemon
restarts, and never bleeds onto a different agent that later reuses the slot. (Sessions without a transcript id yet - a
just-spawned placeholder - can't be renamed until their transcript appears.) See `session.rename` in `docs/protocol.md`.

## Fleet mail for managed agents

Managed Claude, Codex, Hermes, OpenCode, Antigravity, and Cursor sessions receive a restricted local `repomon` MCP
server at spawn or adopt time. It exposes `fleet_status`, `message_send`, `message_inbox`, and `message_mark_read`, plus
the read-only `supervision_status` and `supervision_audit` tools for the caller’s own lane. It does not expose
repomind's mutating fleet tools. The agent process inherits a one-time identity token; only its SHA-256 hash is stored,
and the generated MCP config contains no token.

OpenCode receives the registration through the runtime-only `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` merge, so managed settings with
higher precedence remain authoritative. Antigravity requires its global `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` registration.
Cursor requires its global `~/.cursor/mcp.json` registration. repomon merges only `mcpServers.repomon`, never writes
`.agents/mcp_config.json` in a repository, and keeps identity in the managed process environment. Antigravity may still
show its normal workspace trust and tool permission prompts; Cursor's `--approve-mcps` flag is available for
headless/non-interactive workflows.

Hermes is launched in its persistent modern TUI. Because Hermes filters nonstandard variables before starting stdio MCP
servers, repomon registers `${REPOMON_MCP_*}` placeholders through Hermes's own atomic config writer; the per-session
values are resolved only in the managed process. An opening task is submitted after Hermes reports that its composer is
ready (`-q` is deliberately not used because it exits after one turn). Adopt resumes with `hermes chat --resume <id>`
and keeps the lane worktree with `--no-restore-cwd`.

**Aider**: has no native MCP client support as of its current release. The identity token and socket are still passed
via the process environment in case a future version adds support, but fleet mail tool calls will not reach the MCP
server.

**Custom/Other agents**: the daemon inspects the command's binary name (`kind_from_command`) to detect whether a custom
agent wraps a known binary. Wrappers like `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` receive ClaudeCode's `--mcp-config`
wiring; `agy --mode plan` receives Antigravity's `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` registration; `cursor-agent
--approve-mcps` receives Cursor's `~/.cursor/mcp.json` registration. Completely unknown binaries (e.g.
`my-exotic-agent`) receive no MCP registration, though the three environment variables are always set.

Messages are durable in the daemon database. Terminal injection is only attempted when the recipient has a live managed
window and is waiting, idle, or at an ended turn with no dialog, rate limit, or stall. Agent-to-agent injection is off
by default. Operator and repomind injection is on by default. Inbox access works even when injection is disabled or
unsupported. See `docs/messaging.md` for addressing, threading, limits, and UI behavior.

## Fleet mail and MCP wiring by agent kind

Fleet mail and the orchestrator role both ride on the restricted MCP surface the daemon exposes (`message_send`,
`message_inbox`, `message_mark_read`, `fleet_status`). Mail is addressed by `lane-X/slot`, never by kind, so any wired
agent can mail any other; see `docs/messaging.md` for the address grammar. What differs per kind is how the MCP server
gets registered and whether the kind can run as an orchestrator.

| Kind | Worker fleet mail | Orchestrator | Transcript |
|------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| Claude Code (`claude`) | yes, `--mcp-config` | yes | full JSONL under `~/.claude/projects/` |
| Codex (`codex`) | yes, `-c mcp_servers.repomon...` | yes | pane view only |
| Antigravity (`agy`) | yes, `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` | yes | pane view only |
| OpenCode (`opencode`) | yes, `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` | yes | pane view only |
| Cursor (`cursor-agent`) | yes, `~/.cursor/mcp.json` | no | pane view only |
| Aider (`aider`) | no, Aider has no MCP client | no | mtime only |
| Custom (`[agents]` entries) | routed by the binary's dialect, see below | no | none |

Every wired kind satisfies four pillars on both the spawn and the adopt path: a registration mechanism for the MCP
server, `REPOMON_MCP_MODE=agent`, `REPOMON_MCP_SOCKET`, and `REPOMON_MCP_IDENTITY_TOKEN` in the process environment. The
three environment variables are set for every kind, Aider and unknown custom agents included, so a future MCP-capable
version or an operator wrapper picks them up without changes here. No token or socket path is ever written to a config
file on disk; the registered command only names the `repomond mcp` executable.

All kinds can be adopted. Claude Code, OpenCode and Antigravity resume their session (`--resume`, `--session`,
`--conversation`); Codex, Cursor, Aider and custom agents re-launch fresh in the worktree because Repomon’s adoption
path relaunches them instead of resuming an exact session.

### Custom agents

An `[agents]` entry is classified by its binary name before flags are applied, so a custom command inherits the wiring
of the agent it wraps:

```toml
[agents]
claude-yolo = "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"   # Claude Code wiring
my-agy      = "agy --mode plan"                         # Antigravity wiring
my-cursor   = "cursor-agent --approve-mcps"             # Cursor wiring
exotic-tool = "my-exotic-agent"                         # unknown binary: no MCP wiring
```

### Cursor notes

The CLI is `cursor-agent` (`-p <prompt>` for headless runs, `--approve-mcps` to auto-approve MCP tools, `cursor-agent
mcp list` to inspect registrations). Registration goes into the global `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (or the path in
`REPOMON_CURSOR_MCP_CONFIG`) with the standard `mcpServers` shape; a project-level `.cursor/mcp.json` also works. Cursor
cannot act as an orchestrator.

### Aider notes

The core Aider CLI has no MCP client, so Aider workers get no fleet mail. Community wrappers (`mcpm-aider`, `AiderDesk`)
exist but need a wrapper repomon cannot know about; the environment variables are still set so such a wrapper can use
them.

## External sessions (running in another terminal)

Because status comes from the transcript, a `claude` you start in any other terminal inside a registered repo's worktree
is **detected automatically** - its status and "needs you" show up on that lane, tagged `·ext` (external: repomon didn't
spawn it, so it has no tmux window).

If you run **several** Claude sessions in one worktree, each (a distinct `<session-id>.jsonl`, active within the last
few hours) shows as its own entry in the lane detail - `Tab`/`⇧Tab` move the cursor (`‣`) between them.

repomon can't type into a plain terminal process, so to drive an external session press **`o` to adopt** the highlighted
one (Fleet/Split/Focus): repomon relaunches it in a managed tmux lane.

Every agent kind is adoptable. Claude, OpenCode, and Antigravity resume *that exact* session with the backend's exact
resume flag: Claude uses `--resume <id>`, OpenCode uses `--session <id>`, and Antigravity uses `--conversation <id>`
(without an ID, each backend's continue flag is used instead).

For Codex, Cursor, Aider and custom agents, Repomon’s adoption path relaunches the same command fresh in the worktree
rather than resuming the prior conversation.

The original terminal window is left as-is, so close it once you've adopted. repomon can manage several agents in the
same worktree, each in its own tmux window (`lane-<id>`, `lane-<id>-2`, …), so adopting an external session adds a
managed agent alongside any already running - and you can observe every external session in the lane detail and choose
which to adopt.

## How status is detected

Each agent kind has an `AgentMonitor` (`crates/repomon-core/src/agent/`). Monitors are tried in priority order; the
first to return a summary wins. If no monitor returns a summary, a live managed window starts as **Idle**. The pane
overlay promotes it to **Running** only when working-footer or subagent evidence is visible; a detected permission
dialog becomes **Waiting**.

### Claude Code - rich status

Transcripts live at `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session>.jsonl`, where the directory name is the working
directory with `/` and `.` replaced by `-`. repomon derives:

- **tool-call count** - `tool_use` blocks across assistant messages,
- **status** - *Waiting* (the last entry is an assistant turn with no tool call → **needs you**),
  *Running* (mid tool-loop), or *Idle* (no activity for 10 min),
- **title** - first user message or a `summary` entry.

The encoding scheme has changed before, so it's isolated in `claude::encode_project_dir` and fixture-tested; matching
also falls back to the `cwd` recorded inside each transcript.

### Aider - coarse status

Aider writes `.aider.chat.history.md` into the working directory. repomon uses that file's modification time:
**Running** if it changed in the last two minutes, else **Idle**. (There's no reliable "needs you" signal yet.)

### Codex - pane-based status

`CodexMonitor::summary_for` returns no transcript summary for live status. Managed Codex status comes from the window
placeholder and pane overlay described above. Usage accounting is separate: the ledger parses supported Codex JSONL
usage records. A future transcript-based live-status implementation belongs in `CodexMonitor::summary_for`.

### OpenCode

OpenCode 1.15.5 stores sessions, messages, and parts in its SQLite data store. repomon opens that store read-only,
validates every required table and column before querying, and returns no summary when the schema is incompatible. The
latest assistant finish state and any running tool part produce Running, Waiting, or error attention. Exact adoption
uses `opencode --session <id>`.

OpenCode local token and cost statistics do not satisfy repomon's quota UI contract. Usage is therefore degraded and no
percentage or reset window is displayed.

### Antigravity

Antigravity 1.1.12 documents and maintains `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/cache/last_conversations.json`, a
cwd-to-conversation map. repomon uses that stable cache for external identity and exact `agy --conversation <id>`
adoption. Transcript databases contain protobuf payloads without a stable status contract, so managed windows and pane
dialog detection supply live state. Antigravity's `>` selection cursor is recognized for trust and permission attention.

Because the pane is the only live signal, its layout is read on Antigravity's own terms. It streams the eight-dot
braille spinner cycle (U+28FE, U+28FD, U+28FB, U+28BF, U+287F, U+28DF, U+28EF, U+28F7) rather than the four-dot one, and
prints `esc to cancel` at the head of its status line for exactly as long as a turn is in flight, swapping it for `? for
shortcuts` when the turn ends; both read as "working", and the footer covers a capture that lands between spinner
redraws.

Its menus are boxless, sit above key hints (`Navigate`, `Amend`) that the box-drawing scan reads as content below the
menu, and wrap at the pane width, which splits the contiguous option run at the 80 columns the tmux server usually runs;
`detect_dialog` therefore falls back to a dedicated Antigravity recognizer anchored on the question and one of those
live footers.

A background shell task ticking in the footer is not the agent working, and a quota wall (`Individual quota reached`)
reports itself as `quota exhausted` so an idle row says what stopped it.

The live `/usage` panel was not stable enough to fixture-test percentage and reset fields, so usage is degraded.
Antigravity and OpenCode are both valid repomind orchestrator backends alongside Claude and Codex (`orchestrator.start`
with `agent: "antigravity"`/`"agy"` or `"opencode"`/`"open-code"`); neither has a parseable on-disk transcript, so both
are monitored pane-only, the same tradeoff Codex makes (no `orchestrator.transcript` chat view, no `end_of_turn`
attention, no `session_id`). `aider` and `cursor` have no MCP client repomon can drive as an orchestrator, so
`orchestrator.start` rejects them with `invalid_params` rather than spawning a broken window.

## Adding a new agent

1. Add a variant (or use `Other`) and a binary in `AgentKind` (`model.rs`). 2. Implement `AgentMonitor` for it in
`crates/repomon-core/src/agent/` and add it to    `default_monitors()`. 3. Add it to `AGENT_KINDS` in the TUI so New
Lane can spawn it (Tab to cycle).
