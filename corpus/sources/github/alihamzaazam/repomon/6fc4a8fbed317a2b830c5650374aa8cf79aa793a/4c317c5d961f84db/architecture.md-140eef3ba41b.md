# Architecture

Repomon shares a core library between a background daemon and a thin TUI client. The daemon owns state and git/session
work; the TUI renders cached state and forwards input, keeping interaction responsive and agents alive after the UI
closes.

The agent runtime is abstracted behind a `SessionBackend` trait: a tmux backend on macOS/Linux and a host-process
backend on Windows (see [Session backends](#session-backends-tmux-on-unix-host-processes-on-windows) below). Local IPC
runs over a Unix socket on macOS/Linux and a named pipe on Windows; the JSON-RPC wire protocol is identical on both.

## Crates

- **repomon-core**: the engine. No UI, no socket server. Holds the data model, the SQLite store (a
  dedicated writer thread; never blocks the runtime), the gix-backed git reader and `git worktree`
  shellout, the notify watcher, the repo registry and lane manager, the agent runtime behind the
  `SessionBackend` trait (tmux on Unix, host processes on Windows) and the agent monitors, the local
  transport abstraction (Unix socket ⇄ named pipe), the Phase-3 analytics/sessions/indexer, service
  management (launchd on macOS, systemd user units on Linux, Task Scheduler on Windows), and the shared
  JSON-RPC protocol + framing.
- **repomon-daemon** (`repomond`): hosts core behind a length-prefixed JSON-RPC endpoint (a Unix socket
  on macOS/Linux, a named pipe on Windows). Owns the `Ctx` (store, registry, lanes, the `SessionBackend`,
  event bus, viewport + focus, and the overlay/status caches), the per-connection handling, RPC dispatch,
  the output streamer, the desktop/remote notification watcher, and the background indexer.
- **repomon-tui** (`repomon`): the terminal client and headless CLI. A `DaemonClient` over the transport,
  an async app loop, the four-zoom views, the `repomon attach-host` pop-out attach client (Windows), and
  the `repomon …` subcommands.
- **repomon-host** (`repomon-agent-host.exe`, Windows only) is a small per-agent host process: one ConPTY
  child, a server-side `vt100` screen with scrollback, and a named-pipe control server. It is the Windows
  equivalent of a tmux window and survives daemon restarts. Its control protocol is frozen in
  [../crates/repomon-host/PROTOCOL.md](../crates/repomon-host/PROTOCOL.md).
- **repomon-mcp**: the stdio MCP server library invoked as `repomond mcp` (see "repomind" below). It
  backs both the orchestrator's full fleet tool surface and the restricted `fleet_status` /
  `message_send` / `message_inbox` / `message_mark_read` surface managed worker agents get for fleet mail
  (see [messaging.md](messaging.md)). Bundles ship it a second time as `repomond-mcp`, a hard link to
  the daemon that runs the bridge with no subcommand: a process is named by its executable, so a
  bridge launched as `repomond` reads as another daemon in Activity Monitor. Installs without that
  executable (a plain `cargo install`, and every config written before it existed) keep using the
  `mcp` subcommand.

## Usage ledger

The daemon passively ingests local agent transcripts into `usage_events`, with per-source reader revisions and cursors.
Summary, timeline, session, and model-rate queries price events at query time, so Settings > Usage rate corrections also
re-price history. A new reader revision triggers a bounded recount; missing or unreadable sources retain existing events
and leave the queue. `usage.status.stale_sources` drives desktop progress. The optional account quota probe is separate
from this ledger.

The desktop bundle contains its daemon and CLI, portable tmux on macOS/Linux, and the ConPTY host on Windows. Settings >
System exposes CLI installation and boot diagnostics.

## Key flows

**Fleet refresh.** The TUI calls `lane.list`; the daemon enumerates worktrees (porcelain), computes live state with gix
off the runtime, overlays agent sessions (Claude transcripts, OpenCode SQLite, Antigravity cache, Aider history, then
runtime liveness), and returns lanes. The TUI renders cached state immediately on every keystroke; git never runs on the
UI thread.

**Live agents.** The daemon spawns each agent in its own session backend window: the first at `lane-<id>`, additional
agents sharing a worktree at `lane-<id>-2`, `lane-<id>-3`, … so several run side by side. (On Unix a "window" is a tmux
window; on Windows it is a host process; see [Session
backends](#session-backends-tmux-on-unix-host-processes-on-windows).) The TUI tells the daemon which lanes are visible
(and which agent window the focused lane should stream) via `viewport.set`; a streamer fast-polls only those panes
(`capture_named` / `capture-pane`) and pushes `event.agent.output`. Input goes back via `agent.send_input` (`send-keys`
on Unix, a host `send_*` op on Windows), routed to a specific window in a multi-agent lane; `agent.target` + a raw
attach (`tmux attach`, or `repomon attach-host` on Windows) gives the unmediated session.

**Change propagation.** A debounced notify watcher (250 ms; `.git/objects` and build/dependency churn like `target` and
`node_modules` excluded) plus the Claude projects directory feed `event.repo.changed`; the TUI refetches. A 60 s tick is
the safety net. The watcher is held in the daemon's runtime context and watches/unwatches a tree on `repo.add` /
`repo.remove`, so a removed repo stops churning fsevents instead of being watched until the next restart.

**Desktop notifications.** A `notify_watch` task runs the shared edge-detection over the fleet and fires an alert on
each meaningful agent transition. Remote clients get an `event.notification` broadcast (and APNs push) while `[remote]`
is enabled; locally, the daemon fires desktop popups itself only once the TUI stops covering them - it watches the TUI's
~1 s `lane.list` heartbeat and, after 3 s of silence (the TUI parked in a full-screen attach or closed), takes over so
an alert still reaches you when you're heads-down in an agent pane.

**History.** On startup and after `repo.add`, the indexer walks HEAD history into SQLite, so `timeline`, `sessions`, and
`commit.search` work over history rather than just live HEAD.

**repomind.** Repomind is an agent session in a lane of its own: the *controller lane*, the main worktree of the
repomind home repo (`~/repomind` by default, `[repomind] home`). The daemon ensures that repo on startup and on every
`orchestrator.start`: it creates the layout and runs `git init -b main` when it is missing, never overwrites a file that
already exists, registers it like any other repo, and marks its lane `role = "controller"` (`lanes.role`, migration
0022).

Every agent in that lane is a controller: it is launched with `REPOMON_MCP_MODE=orchestrator`, so `repomon-mcp` serves
it the full fleet catalog rather than the restricted worker one, and `[repomind] max_controllers` caps how many may run
there at once.

A worker agent (one holding an MCP identity bound to some other lane) cannot spawn into the controller lane, and
`delete_lane`/`merge_lane` on it are refused outright in the MCP policy layer, before the two-phase confirm and at every
autonomy level.

The primary controller starts with `orchestrator.start` (Claude by default, or Codex, Antigravity, or OpenCode, via its
`agent` param or `[repomind] primary_agent`, which falls back to the older `orchestrator_agent`). Only MCP-capable CLIs
qualify (aider and cursor can't drive the fleet tools, so both are rejected); a Codex/Antigravity/OpenCode-backed
session degrades to pane-only monitoring, with no parsed transcript chat, no end-of-turn attention, and no session
pinning (Claude is the only backend with a parseable on-disk transcript).

The `orchestrator.*` RPCs (`.stop`, `.target`, `.send_input`, `.key`, `.resize`, `.watch`) are now thin aliases onto the
controller lane's window and are deprecated in favor of the ordinary lane/agent RPCs; the daemon-owned `orchestrator`
tmux window survives only as an adoption fallback, so a window left by a pre-R1 daemon is still picked up rather than
duplicated. `repomind.status` reports the home path, its repo and lane, the controller window, the cap, the export
state, what the home holds, and the state of the boot context.

**Boot context.** A controller starts with no memory of the fleet, so the daemon assembles one before every spawn into
the controller lane (and on the `repomind.boot` RPC) and writes it to `<home>/.repomind/boot.md`, which is daemon-owned
and gitignored. `repomind::boot::assemble_boot` is pure: it reads the home and concatenates, in this order, the
operator's `REPOMIND.md` overlay whole, each `profile/*.md` body with its frontmatter stripped, one status line per
`plans/active/*.md` (title, status, owner, and the body's `Next step` line), yesterday's and today's journal day files,
and a fleet snapshot of one line per lane (repo, lane, branch, agent count, most urgent agent state). The snapshot is
the only live truth in the document; everything else is memory, and the persona in
`crates/repomon-mcp/assets/repomind.md` stays authoritative for tool semantics and safety.

The whole document is bounded by `[repomind] boot_budget_tokens` (12k by default, estimated at four characters to a
token). Over budget it drops whole files from the least important end, the journal first (older day before newer), then
profile notes, then plan lines, and ends with a `Trimmed: ...` line naming exactly what went, so a controller can tell
"nothing to say" from "it did not fit". The overlay and the fleet snapshot are never trimmed.

Delivery is per backend, because no two of these CLIs take context the same way. Claude gets
`--append-system-prompt-file <path>` *in addition to* the persona's `--append-system-prompt`, so the boot document is
appended and never substituted. OpenCode gets the path in the `instructions` list of the `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` the
daemon already synthesizes, preserving the operator's own entries. Codex and Antigravity have neither mechanism, so the
daemon types one line naming the file into the composer once the session is ready, through the same verified-composer
injection fleet mail uses (`inject::Payload::VerifiedLine`): it waits for a session with no dialog and no pending
prompt, gives up after 90 seconds, and writes at most three supervision rows. `repomind::boot::delivery` is the single
place that maps an agent kind to its mechanism.

**Journal trim.** Day files older than 90 days are rolled into `journal/archive/YYYY-MM.md` (one section per day, keyed
by an HTML comment so a re-run cannot duplicate one) and the day file is removed. The rollup runs in `repomind::start`
and once a day after that, and both the archive write and the day-file removal ride the ordinary export commit.

`repomon-mcp` (invoked as `repomond mcp`) is a stdio MCP server the orchestrator agent launches as a subprocess and
wires up as a tool server; it connects back to the same daemon socket as an ordinary client and keeps a fleet snapshot
refreshed by poll-and-diff (`lane.list` on a ~1.5s cadence, woken early on a structural event - a lane created/deleted).

Because the orchestrator session pre-approves its own fleet tool calls (`--allowedTools` on Claude, the approval policy
on Codex - no permission dialog to intercept, unlike a worker agent), the MCP server's own policy layer - autonomy
level, a per-session action cap, a send-dedupe window, two-phase confirm tokens for destructive actions - is the *sole*
gate on what repomind can do.

The daemon's `notify_watch` tick, the same one that fires desktop alerts for lane agents, also classifies repomind's own
attention (a pending dialog, or - Claude only - an idle end-of-turn) each pass and broadcasts it as
`event.orchestrator.status`.

## Session backends (tmux on Unix, host processes on Windows)

Every place the runtime spawns, captures, sends input to, resizes, streams, or kills an agent goes through one trait,
`SessionBackend` (`crates/repomon-core/src/agent/backend.rs`). There are two implementations and nothing else in the
daemon knows which is live:

- **Unix, `TmuxRuntime`.** tmux owns the durable, out-of-process agent runtime; the trait methods render
  to `tmux` subcommands (`new-window`, `capture-pane`, `send-keys`, `resize-window`, `pipe-pane`,
  `attach`, `kill-window`). tmux itself is resolved in order: a system install on `PATH`, then a portable
  tmux binary bundled with the app as a sidecar, so macOS and Linux need no separate tmux install.
- **Windows, `WindowsBackend`.** No tmux. Each agent runs in its own detached host process,
  `repomon-agent-host.exe`, which owns a ConPTY child plus a server-side `vt100` screen with 50 000 lines
  of scrollback (parity with tmux `history-limit 50000`). The backend is a named-pipe client of those
  hosts.

Commands are assembled structurally as a `SpawnSpec { program, args, cwd, env }` rather than a shell string: the tmux
backend renders it through its existing shell-quoting, and the Windows host feeds it straight to ConPTY, so there is no
`sh -c` or `cmd /c` quoting on Windows.

### tmux-parity mapping

| Concept | Unix (tmux) | Windows (host processes) |
|---|---|---|
| process registry | tmux window names on a dedicated tmux server | host registry dir + named pipes: `<data_dir>\hosts\<session>\<window>.json` |
| agent process owner | tmux server (out-of-process, durable) | one `repomon-agent-host.exe` per window, detached, survives daemon restarts |
| PTY | tmux-owned pty | ConPTY (`portable-pty`) inside the host |
| capture-pane | `tmux capture-pane -e -p` | server-side `vt100` screen render (the source of truth; ConPTY quirks do not leak) |
| byte stream | `pipe-pane` + `mkfifo` FIFO | host byte subscription over its pipe (`subscribe_bytes`) |
| send input | `tmux send-keys` | host writes translated VT sequences to the ConPTY |
| resize | `tmux resize-window` | host resizes the ConPTY + vt100 screen (last-client-wins) |
| attach | `tmux attach` (PTY handoff) | `repomon attach-host <window>` raw byte proxy in a new Windows Terminal tab |
| owner guard | `@repomon-owner` tmux server option | owner token in the registry file + `hello` handshake |
| kill-window | `tmux kill-window` | host kills the child, removes its registry entry, exits |

### Durability and re-adoption (Windows)

Hosts are spawned with `DETACHED_PROCESS | CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` and keep running when the daemon dies, the same
durability tmux gives on Unix. On startup `WindowsBackend` scans the registry directory, connects to each pipe, verifies
the `hello` (owner token + liveness), GCs stale entries whose pipe will not connect, and **re-adopts** the surviving
hosts with scrollback intact. This is the Windows equivalent of the daemon rediscovering an existing tmux server.
Liveness on Windows skips the Unix `ps`/`lsof`//proc probe entirely: a host authoritatively knows whether its child is
alive, so the backend asks it directly.

### Named-pipe control protocol

Each host serves one pipe, `\\.\pipe\repomon-<session>-<window>`, secured with a per-user DACL. The wire format is
length-prefixed JSON with request/response ops (`hello`, `capture`, `cursor`, `size`, `alternate_on`, `resize`,
`send_literal`, `send_text`, `send_key`, `scroll_wheel`, `subscribe_bytes`, `kill`). The full, frozen contract is
[../crates/repomon-host/PROTOCOL.md](../crates/repomon-host/PROTOCOL.md). Three points worth calling out because clients
(the daemon backend and the attach client) depend on them:

- **The byte stream is a raw byte channel.** `subscribe_bytes` switches the connection to stream mode;
  its **first** frame is a full current-screen replay (a client that starts a fresh emulator, applies
  frame 1, then applies subsequent frames verbatim converges exactly), and every later frame is a raw PTY
  output chunk.
- **A client derives the pipe name from config.** The `<window>` half of the pipe name is the tmux/host
  window id; the `<session>` half is `config.tmux_session` (default `repomon`), the same session name the
  tmux backend uses. A client that knows the window and the configured session name can compute the pipe
  without a lookup.
- **An interactive attach uses two connections.** Once a connection has issued `subscribe_bytes` the host
  ignores any further client frames on it (disconnect is the only unsubscribe), so an attach client opens
  a **second** control connection for `resize` / `send_*` while the first streams bytes to the terminal.

## Performance posture

- All git and tmux work runs in `spawn_blocking`; the reactor never blocks.
- SQLite writes go through one owned connection on a dedicated thread.
- The output streamer fast-polls only *visible* lanes, on an activity-driven backoff (the focused pane
  stays fast; idle/background panes back off to a cap) with a per-tick capture cap, and each tmux capture
  is a single fork; at rest it does nothing.
- Hot reads are cached so rapid client polls don't re-scan: the `lane.list` overlay (lanes + agent
  sessions) behind a short TTL invalidated only on structural changes, plus per-worktree gix-status,
  per-repo `git worktree list`, and per-window pending-prompt caches. A transcript write touches no
  worktree, so it never triggers a status walk.
- The TUI renders cached state, so first paint doesn't wait on the daemon.

### Measured (release, macOS, 3 fixture repos × 8 commits)

| Gate | Target | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| daemon cold start | < 500 ms | ~15 ms |
| `repomon --print-once` (warm daemon) | < 100 ms | ~38 ms median |
| daemon CPU, monitoring agents (idle) | < 2 % | ~1.35 % avg · median 0 % |
| daemon CPU, 8-pane Grid live-streaming | < 6 % | ~5 % avg · 2.5 % median |

(`hyperfine` wasn't available, so the latency rows were timed with a `perf_counter` harness over fixture repos; the CPU
rows were sampled live via `ps` CPU-time deltas.) The per-lane Claude status lookup is an O(1) encoded-directory check
on the hot path; the encoding-drift fallback scan is reserved for explicit use to keep refresh fast.

The CPU figures are post-optimization. The daemon previously pegged a core (~150 % sustained, all fork/exec overhead
from a flat-10 Hz multi-fork pane streamer and a per-call worktree-walk storm - the tmux server itself idled at 0.3 %);
the streamer backoff, single-fork captures, and the overlay/status caches above brought it down to the numbers shown.
