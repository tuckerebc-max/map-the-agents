# Mission Control (desktop app)

Mission Control is Repomon’s desktop client, with embedded agent terminals, Git, editing, usage tracking, fleet mail and
Repomind orchestration. It shares the daemon and fleet with the TUI and iOS client, so all three can watch the same
fleet at once.

The [GUI demo recorder](../scripts/record-gui-demo.sh) creates an isolated synthetic fleet for a 90-second tour of
multitasking, Git, editing, Usage, Repomail, Supervision and Repomind, or a 60-second problem-first
workflow with `--tour workflow`. `--dry-run` verifies the sandbox; `--dry-run
--tour` rehearses without recording. Capture requires Screen Recording permission for the invoking macOS terminal. The optional AX
driver also needs Accessibility and System Events Automation permission. `--still` captures the same opening hero at 1440x900. See the [recorder
guide](../scripts/gui-demo/README.md) for commands and isolation details.

## Install

Download the desktop app from the moving [desktop-preview release](https://github.com/AliHamzaAzam/repomon/releases/tag/desktop-preview).

| Platform | Download and install |
|---|---|
| macOS (Apple silicon and Intel) | `Repomon_<version>_universal.dmg`: open it and drag Repomon to Applications. |
| Windows | `Repomon_<version>_x64-setup.exe`: run the installer. No WSL or separate Visual C++ runtime is required. |
| Linux | An AppImage, deb or rpm: make the AppImage executable, or install the package with your distribution's package manager. |

The app bundles the daemon (`repomond`), the CLI/TUI (`repomon`), portable tmux on macOS and Linux, and the ConPTY agent host on Windows. No existing Repomon installation or separate tmux install is required for the desktop app.

Install Git and at least one agent CLI, such as Claude Code or Codex, and sign in to that agent. The setup wizard checks these prerequisites. To use the bundled CLI from a terminal, choose **Settings > System > Command-line tools > Install**.

The `desktop-preview` tag is the moving desktop release used by preview-channel installs for updates. "Preview" names that rolling testing channel, not a requirement to assemble the app yourself. The standalone CLI uses the [latest versioned release](https://github.com/AliHamzaAzam/repomon/releases/latest). The desktop app checks for updates on launch and in **Settings > General > Check for updates**.

Updates are cryptographically signed. The current desktop downloads do not yet have an OS-level code signature, so macOS Gatekeeper or Windows SmartScreen may prompt on first install. Those are separate signing systems. On macOS, use the system's Open Anyway approval for the downloaded app; on Windows, use **More info > Run anyway** if SmartScreen prompts.

Open Repomon after the OS approval. The bundled daemon starts automatically. The first-run wizard checks Git, the agent runtime and installed agent CLIs, then helps you add a repository, choose an agent and configure notifications and optional Repomind. Add a lane and start your agent; its terminal appears in the workspace.

When opened from the Dock or Finder, Repomon resolves your login shell's PATH at startup so tools in `~/.local/bin` or `/opt/homebrew/bin` can be found.

A **first-run setup wizard** takes a new install through seven steps: a welcome screen that says what Repomon does and
what a lane and a worktree are, a system check (the same tmux/git/agent-CLI probes as Settings > System, below, with
install commands and a re-check button), adding your first repositories, choosing a default agent from the CLIs that
were actually found, turning on desktop notifications and the needs-you alert, an introduction to the Repomind home at
`~/repomind` with an option to start it when setup finishes, and a summary of what was set up.

A rail across the top shows where you are and takes you back to any step you have already seen; Back and Continue sit in
the footer, Enter continues, and Skip setup (or Esc) leaves for the app at any point.

Each move is written to local storage, so quitting mid-way to install a CLI or clone a repo resumes on the same step
rather than at the start. Settings > General > Replay Onboarding reopens it from the top.

On Windows, one custom title bar contains the app toolbar and native-style minimize, maximize, and close controls. There
is no second system title bar above it.

## The app icon

The brand sources are kept outside version control (`docs/brand/` is gitignored and lives on the maintainer's machine);
the repository ships only the rendered icons under `apps/desktop/src-tauri/icons` and
`apps/desktop/src-tauri/macos/Assets.car`. The approved geometry is `docs/brand/repo-logo-final.svg`, including the
user's manual path adjustments. Preserve that file's paths, stroke widths, openings, and central square. The macOS Icon
Composer bundle at `docs/brand/final/macos/Repomon.icon` expands the source strokes into closed filled outlines and
separates the mesh and square into two SVG layers. This avoids the macOS 26 renderer filling across open stroke
interiors when applying layer colors. The source SVG remains unchanged. Icon Composer 2.0 and the Xcode 27 toolchain
supply the Liquid Glass lighting, refraction, masking, and appearance variants. The SVG layers contain no baked effects.

1. Save material, transparency, color and lighting edits in Icon Composer. If the canonical SVG geometry changed, refresh its two vector layers first as described below.
2. From the maintainer repository root, regenerate and install the rendered assets:

   ```bash
   python3 docs/brand/final/tools/build-macos.py
   python3 docs/brand/final/tools/install-macos.py
   python3 docs/brand/final/tools/install-windows.py
   ```

Save material, transparency, color, and lighting edits in Icon Composer before running the macOS build. The build
compiles the saved `.icon` document as-is and checks that its files remain byte-identical; it never resets Composer
settings. If the canonical SVG geometry changes, run `python3 docs/brand/final/tools/export-macos-layers.py` explicitly
first to refresh only the two vector layers while preserving `icon.json`.

To update an existing local installation's icon without rebuilding or restarting its executable:

```bash
python3 docs/brand/final/tools/install-macos.py --app /Applications/Repomon.app
```

This backs up and replaces only `Assets.car` and `icon.icns`, then verifies the executable is unchanged. Saving in Icon
Composer does not automatically update compiled or installed app icons. Dock or Finder can retain the previous cached
image until the app is reopened or the icon refreshes.

The macOS build needs Xcode's Icon Composer and native rendering services. It emits six 1024px appearance previews,
`Assets.car`, and the native static `Repomon.icns` fallback, plus a 256px preview extracted from the fallback for
compatibility inspection. The installer copies the catalog to `src-tauri/macos/` and the ICNS to
`src-tauri/icons/icon.icns`. `bundle.macOS.files` packages the catalog, and `CFBundleIconName=Repomon` selects it on
modern macOS. Older macOS uses the native ICNS fallback.

Windows and Linux use a separate flat warm-white tile with the exact approved graphite and orange mark. The Windows
build requires `rsvg-convert`, renders each size directly from the SVG, and packs a multiresolution RGBA ICO. It also
regenerates the Store logo sizes. These PNGs are not downsized from the macOS glass artwork. Preview and provenance
files live in `docs/brand/final/`.

The in-app mark (`src/components/BrandMark.tsx`) is the same glyph drawn from theme tokens rather than the icon's fixed
palette, so it follows the light/dark setting and your chosen accent. Only the OS-level icon is the glass artwork.

## Keyboard control

Everything the app does can be driven from the keyboard. Press `mod+?` (`⌘?` on macOS, Ctrl+? elsewhere) or a bare `?` outside a text
field to open a searchable cheat sheet overlay; **Settings > Keyboard** holds the same reference plus a conflict check
and a printable page. Both are generated from the same table that dispatches the shortcuts, so neither can drift from
what actually works.

Shortcuts use a modifier on purpose. A focused terminal forwards every bare keystroke to the agent running in it, so an
unmodified shortcut would steal the agent's input. `mod` below is **Cmd on macOS** and **Ctrl elsewhere**.

| `escape` | Close the finder |

Git, repomind, and the compact editor share one right-rail panel host: a resizable pane (drag its left edge) with one
header button per tab. Pressing a tab's chord (or clicking its header button) opens the rail on that tab if it is
closed, switches to that tab if the rail is open on another one, and closes the rail if it is already open on that tab.
Each header button's active state is scoped to its own tab, so opening on Git does not light up the Repomind button. The
**Repomind** button also carries a small state dot, the counterpart to Repomail's unread badge: teal while a controller
is running, amber (or red) when one wants you, and nothing at all when the home is off.

### Editor workspace

The toolbar **Editor** button is a split button: - Clicking **Editor** opens the full center-pane Editor workspace,
mutually exclusive with Multitasking. - Clicking the split chevron (or pressing `mod+2`) toggles the compact side-rail
editor.

Both the center workspace and the rail editor share the same in-memory editor store. Open tabs, unsaved buffer edits,
cursor positions, and scroll offsets remain intact when moving between the center workspace and the rail editor, or when
switching between lanes.

The center Editor workspace provides:

| Component | Features |
|---|---|
| File tree | A resizable file tree on the left (persisted width, min 180px, default 240px) with real-time filter search, SVG file-kind icons, keyboard navigation (arrow keys to navigate, Enter to open, Left and Right to collapse or expand), and a locate button to reveal the active file. |
| Editor tabs | A multi-tab editor in the center supporting syntax highlighting across every language, bracket auto-closing, code folding, word completion, multi-cursor editing, and image/binary/PDF viewers. |
| Status line | A status line at the bottom showing the syntax language (clickable to override), cursor position (line and column), detected indentation unit, and one-click toggles for line wrapping and rendering whitespace. |
| Markdown preview | For Markdown buffers (`.md` and `.markdown`), a live preview toggle in the status line (or `mod+shift+v`) opens a resizable side-by-side split. The editor and preview maintain scroll synchronization aligned to the nearest heading, with support for task lists, GitHub tables, fenced code highlighting, local image resolution, and external links. |
| SVG preview | For SVG buffers, the same preview toggle (and `mod+shift+v`) opens the rendered SVG in the same resizable split, live from the unsaved buffer (sanitized before render). `.svg` files stay text tabs otherwise - full syntax editing, not a dedicated image viewer. |
| Image viewer | The image viewer (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, ICO) streams bytes through the asset protocol, fills the tab, and supports fit/actual-size/free zoom (10-800%), `Mod` plus scroll-wheel zoom around the cursor, drag-to-pan, and double-click to toggle fit and actual size. |

### Editor

CodeMirror's own bindings, live only while the editor has focus - these are not in the global dispatcher above, so they
cannot be remapped from Settings and do not appear if you search the overlay without the editor focused.

| Chord | Action |
|---|---|
| `mod+s` | Save file |
| `mod+/` | Toggle line comment |
| `mod+d` | Select next occurrence |
| `mod+g` | Go to line |
| `alt+up` | Move line up |
| `alt+down` | Move line down |
| `shift+alt+down` | Copy line down |

### Layout

| Chord | Action |
|---|---|
| `mod+shift+1` | Focused layout, one pane |
| `mod+shift+2` | Split layout, active pane plus its peer |
| `mod+shift+0` | Grid layout, up to six panes |

### Fleet

| Chord | Action |
|---|---|
| `mod+shift+o` | Open the home screen |
| `mod+/` | Filter the fleet |
| `mod+u` | Show only lanes needing attention |
| `mod+r` | Refresh |
| `mod+n` | New lane |
| `mod+shift+n` | Add repository |
| `mod+g` | Jump to a lane needing attention |
| `mod+shift+h` | Hide the selected lane's project |
| `mod+shift+b` | Edit the selected lane's project notes |

#### The sidebar

Two lines per lane, with the same anatomy on every row so the columns can be read down rather than across. The first
line is the health dot, the lane name (the part that gives way if the sidebar runs out of room), and the most urgent
status, one short word from a fixed vocabulary that never truncates. The second line is the branch (truncating from its
start so the identifying tail stays visible, unlike the name), the agent count or agent icon, and one change cell
holding either uncommitted files or divergence from upstream (the tooltip carries both, and the status pill's tooltip
carries the daemon's fuller explanation). The sidebar scrolls once a project's lanes outgrow the visible height.

A project header names its own count ("12 lanes") and carries an amber pip with the number of its agents that need you,
so a collapsed project still reports. Hidden projects sit behind one disclosure at the bottom; expanding gives one dense
line each, with an unhide button on hover.

Above the projects sits one pinned **Repomind** row, in the same two-line anatomy. Its first line is the brain mark, the
name, the needs-you pip, and the same one-word status pill every lane carries, reading "off" when no controller is
running. Its second line is the home path and what the home holds: the number of controllers in the lane and the number
of goals in `plans/active`. Clicking it focuses the controller lane's agents in the terminal bay exactly as clicking a
lane row does; right-clicking offers **Start Repomind** (or **Stop Repomind**), **Open panel**, and **Open home in
editor**. The row is the sidebar's first stop, so `j` / `k` and the arrow keys walk from it into the project groups.

The repomind home is not one of those groups. It is registered like any other repo, but the sidebar files it under the
pinned row instead, and its controllers are counted there rather than in the project headers or the "Needs you" and
"Running" chips, so nothing is counted twice.

A worktree lane whose branch is already contained in the repository's default branch is marked "merged": the work
landed, and the worktree is bookkeeping. Right-clicking a lane row offers "Pin lane to top" and, for a worktree lane,
"Remove worktree", which raises the usual confirm and keeps the branch.

The two filter chips ("Needs you", "Running") are toggles over the same per-agent state the rows show, so a chip's
number always matches the rows it selects. Below a measured width they drop their labels for an icon plus the count,
with the full label moved to the tooltip, rather than truncating the text mid-word.

#### Agent status

Every pill, chip, count and filter in the sidebar is derived from one per-agent state, so a lane row and the chip above
it can never disagree. The daemon decides the state; the frontend only projects it, and never re-reads pane text or runs
timers of its own.

| State | Means |
|---|---|
| running | the pane is working: a spinner or streaming marker is on screen, background subagents are going, or the transcript is still being written |
| needs you | the turn ended with nothing pending, and the agent is waiting for the next instruction |
| decision | a permission, plan or question dialog is open on the pane |
| stalled | a running agent whose pane has not changed for longer than the stall threshold |
| limited | paused on a usage limit; repomon auto-continues it at the reset time |
| idle | at its prompt with no dialog and nothing running |
| external | a session running outside repomon, adoptable but not managed |
| inferred | the worktree is changing but the agent behind it could not be identified |
| exited | the agent's process ended; nothing is running in the pane |

The pane outranks the transcript on liveness, in both directions. A transcript only records when the last message
landed, so it decays to idle through a long tool call and reads "needs you" through a turn whose background agents are
still working; both of those are panes the operator can see are busy.

The other way round, an agent repomon has no transcript for (Codex, Antigravity, aider) is judged by how recently its
files moved, which a background task the agent started keeps moving after the turn is over: a pane with no dialog, no
subagent and no spinner ends that, reading "background file activity only, pane at rest" rather than "no output for 1s".

An agent whose transcript shows a turn genuinely mid flight is never demoted this way, because a capture taken between
redraws can miss a spinner; a frozen pane surfaces as stalled instead. A dialog outranks everything: a pane asking a
question is not working, whatever else is on screen.

Classification runs on the daemon every two seconds for every managed session, whatever any client has in view and
whether or not notifications are on, and each status transition is pushed as `event.agent.status` (`lane_id`, `session`,
`window`, `status`, `reason`, `previous`). The sidebar also polls, so a status change lands within one heartbeat even if
nothing is pushed.

Counts are agent counts, never lane counts. "Needs you" counts agents in needs you, decision, stalled or limited;
"Running" counts agents in running. A lane pill shows the most urgent state among its agents plus, for running, how many
of them are in it. Hovering a pill shows the daemon's `status_reason` for the agents behind it ("spinner on screen:
Thinking (2m 14s)", "dialog pending: Bash", "no output for 41m"), so a status you do not believe can be reported rather
than merely doubted.

### Lane

These need a selected lane. With nothing selected they do nothing.

| Chord | Action |
|---|---|
| `mod+e` | Spawn agent |
| `mod+shift+j` | Switch Terminal / Chat |
| `mod+t` | Open terminal |
| `mod+shift+p` | Pin or unpin lane |
| `mod+d` | Delete lane (asks first) |
| `mod+shift+m` | Merge lane (asks first) |
| `mod+.` | Stop the agent in the visible pane (asks first) |

### Agents

| Chord | Action |
|---|---|
| `mod+[` | Previous agent tab |
| `mod+]` | Next agent tab |

### Terminals

| Chord | Action |
|---|---|
| `mod+shift+f` | Find in the terminal |
| `shift+escape` | Leave the terminal, back to the fleet list |

`shift+escape` rather than plain Escape is deliberate: Claude Code uses Escape to interrupt its own work, so the
terminal keeps it. Once focus is on the fleet list, `j`/`k` and the arrow keys move the selection and `/` jumps to the
filter.

## Settings

**Settings > General** holds the default agent, the worktree path template, the auto-continue message, and the behavior
toggles (auto-continue rate-limited agents, prompt on spawn, probe account usage, expand multi-agent lanes, embedded
terminal renderer). The updater lives at the bottom.

**System** shows live checks for `tmux` (system install or the bundled sidecar), `git`, and every configured agent CLI,
each with a one-click-copy install command when it is missing. This is the same check the first-run wizard runs and the
footer connection pill opens when it has something to flag. It also holds the daemon's self-service controls: stop,
start, or reset the daemon, and bulk-restore agent sessions left orphaned by a crash or an update.

Two rows at the top of that tab do not go through the daemon, because they are what you need when the daemon is the
thing that is broken:

- **Bundled Daemon** runs `repomond --version` from the copy inside this bundle and reports the exact
  result. A daemon that cannot start at all (on Windows, a missing Visual C++ runtime kills it in the
  loader with `0xC0000135` before a single line reaches its log) shows up here as "Does not start", with
  the failure, the one line that fixes it, and a **Show log** button. Every other row on this tab goes
  blank in exactly that situation, which is why this one asks the binary directly.
- **Command-line tools** installs the `repomon` CLI out of the bundle. macOS and Linux get symlinks to
  `repomon` and `repomond` in `~/.local/bin`, so an app update carries through without reinstalling.
  Linux AppImage installs use copies instead because their mount disappears on exit; remove and install
  these tools again after app updates. Windows gets copies of `repomon.exe`, `repomond.exe`, and
  `repomon-agent-host.exe` in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\repomon\bin` plus that directory on the **user** PATH in
  `HKCU\Environment` (the machine PATH is never touched, so no elevation is needed). The card reports the
  installed version by running it, says whether a terminal can find the directory (it asks your login
  shell, not the app's own stripped `PATH`), and gives you the exact `export PATH` line to paste when it
  cannot. Shell probes run in the background with a two-second limit; a failed probe shows "could not
  read your shell PATH" and leaves PATH status unknown. Existing regular binaries in `~/.local/bin` move
  to `<name>.bak`, and an existing backup is preserved. **Remove** restores these backups after removing
  the app-installed links or copies, and removes the PATH entry on Windows. The last step of the setup
  wizard offers the same card.

**Agents** lets you add or remove custom agent CLIs (a name plus the launch command) and set the default agent, without
hand-editing `config.toml`. See `docs/agents.md` for the underlying `agent.add`/`agent.remove`/`agent.set_default`
mechanism, which this tab is a UI over.

**Notifications** has a master switch plus one toggle per event: needs-you, rate-limited, resumed, idle, sound,
show-why, coalescing, click-to-focus, and whether subagents count.

Mission Control asks for notification permission on first launch. That request is what registers it with Notification
Center, and it is why its alerts carry the repomon icon; decline it and the app posts nothing, leaving only the daemon's
fallback below.

It also holds **System popup when no window is open**. The daemon posts its own OS notification when no UI is covering
one, which on macOS goes out through `osascript` and so arrives from Script Editor, wearing Script Editor's icon. Turn
it off and that popup stops: Mission Control still notifies under its own identity while it is running, and the TUI
still pops its own while it is on screen. The trade is that a machine running neither UI stops notifying at the OS
level, which is why it ships on.

**Appearance** defaults to the brand orange accent with graphite ink and a warm light ground (or lifted graphite on a
dark ground). It sets the accent from a swatch or a custom hex value, picks the repomind agent and model, and holds
**Sort projects by activity**: with it on, sidebar project groups order by their most recent lane activity so whatever
you are working in floats to the top. Only the groups move. Lane order inside a group is deliberately left alone,
because sorting lanes by activity makes them bubble around on every line an agent prints.

**Policies** holds the standing rules: **Approvals** and **Supervision** defaults, as its own sub-tabs. The control
center's `⌘K` search can jump straight here via "Open Policies". Playbooks, standing duties, and the journal are not
settings; they live in the Repomind panel (`mod+9`), and the tab says so at the bottom.

**Keyboard** is the shortcut reference, with search, a conflict check (flags any two shortcuts that share both a chord
and a scope), a warning on Windows and Linux about the Ctrl-reaches-the-terminal caveat (see Known gaps), and a **Print
cheat sheet** button that opens a plain, printable page listing every shortcut.

Most settings are stored by the daemon and shared with the TUI; the modal saves those with **Save**. Usage tracking,
price refresh, and model-rate edits apply immediately. The sidebar cost switch is a local desktop preference and also
applies immediately.

If the daemon connection drops for more than a few seconds, a banner appears rather than letting the UI sit silently
stale; it clears as soon as the connection is restored.

## When the daemon will not start

The app spawns `repomond` detached and windowless, so a spawn that fails or a daemon that exits at once used to show up
as a connection pill saying "Retrying" and nothing else. It now watches the child for its first three seconds and
reports what actually happened:

- **The binary is not there.** A broken or partial install; the pill names the path it looked at.
- **The OS refused to start it.** The pill carries the spawn error.
- **It started and exited immediately.** The pill carries the exit code (in hex too, since that is the
  form every Microsoft page uses), and the tail of the daemon log goes into the diagnostics block.
- **It is running but nothing answers the endpoint.** The pill carries the connect error and the endpoint
  as the platform names it, which on Windows is the pipe name, not a file path.

Two Windows causes get a plain sentence instead of a status code. `0xC0000135` (`STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND`, a missing Visual
C++ runtime) and `0xC000007B` (`STATUS_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT`, a wrong-architecture one) both resolve to "install the x64
redistributable", with the link. A named pipe another session already owns (access denied, or all pipe instances busy)
resolves to "end the stale `repomond.exe` in Task Manager".

The retrying rail offers **Show log**, which opens `repomond.out.log` in the system's text viewer, and **Copy
diagnostics**, which puts the app version, the OS, the endpoint, the last error, the resolved daemon path, the log path,
and the log tail on the clipboard in one block.

## Hiding projects

A project you are not working in can be hidden from the sidebar with the `⊘` button on its header or `mod+shift+h`.
Hiding is not removing: the repo stays registered, stays watched, and keeps every lane and worktree it owns. Its lanes
leave the sidebar and stop counting toward the needs-you and running totals, and a **Hidden (N)** list at the bottom of
the sidebar brings any of them back.

The flag lives in the daemon, so the TUI honors it too and it survives a restart. The TUI has no unhide view of its own,
so a project hidden there stays hidden until you restore it here.

## Repo notes

Every registered project has a notes file: conventions, build and test commands, merge preferences, gotchas, anything
worth telling a worker every time. repomind reads them when it plans and folds them into the prompts of agents it spawns
there, so this is where you write something the orchestrator will still know next week.

Open them from `mod+shift+b`, or right-click a project header in the sidebar and choose **Repo notes**. They are plain
markdown on disk under the daemon's data directory and stay editable outside the app, so the editor loads fresh each
time rather than caching. The 8 KB cap is enforced by the daemon; the editor counts bytes (not characters) against it so
a doomed save is refused before it is sent.

## The orchestration journal

repomind writes every action it takes to a journal the daemon owns: what it did, which lane and repo it touched, and
whether it worked. The Repomind panel's **Memory** section has an **Activity** button that opens it newest first, so the
record sits beside the memory it describes rather than behind a settings modal.

## Playbooks

When repomind finishes a multi-lane goal it drafts a playbook: the pattern, the per-repo steps, the worker prompts that
worked, the failure modes it hit. The Repomind panel's **Playbooks** section lists them.

A draft is inert. repomind is only offered a playbook back once you approve it, which is deliberate: instructions the
orchestrator wrote feeding into its own future prompts unreviewed is a self-poisoning path. Approve is only reachable
once you have opened a playbook and its text is on screen, so nothing can be waved through from the list.

A playbook that was approved and then re-drafted reads **approved · revision pending**: the old approved text is still
what repomind follows, and the revision waits for you. Deleting asks first, since the procedure took real work to earn;
approving does not, because reading it and clicking Approve is the review.

## Standing orchestrations

A daily schedule such as `daily 09:00` runs its saved goal at that time.

The Repomind panel's **Standing duties** section runs repomind on a timer without you starting it. **Add** opens an
inline form there: a spec, a goal, and optionally an action cap. Results arrive as notifications and land in the
journal.

The spec grammar is `daily HH:MM`, `weekdays HH:MM`, `weekends HH:MM`, `every Nm`, or `every Nh`. The app deliberately
does not re-implement that grammar to pre-validate your input, because a second copy would drift from the daemon's; a
bad spec comes back with an error that names the accepted forms.

Unattended runs are bounded harder than attended ones: a lower action cap, and repomind refuses to merge or delete a
lane when nobody is watching. It reports and recommends instead. Leaving the cap blank uses the daemon's conservative
default rather than sending zero, which would produce a schedule that fires and does nothing.

## Approval policy

**Settings > Policies > Approvals** lists the command patterns repomind may approve on your behalf, grouped by project.
These are learned: after you approve the same pattern in the same repo enough times, repomind proposes a rule and you
confirm it. Revoke any of them here.

Two limits are structural, not settings. Destructive commands always reach you no matter what is listed here, and a
denial is never generalised into an auto-deny, it just keeps escalating. Rules are per-repo, so `cargo test` approved in
two projects is two rules and revoking one leaves the other standing.

## Repomind

The repomind panel is one tab of the right-rail panel host (alongside git and the editor, above) and opens with `mod+9`.
`mod+shift+9` blows it up to full screen, and Escape or **Exit** brings it back; going full screen opens the panel if it
was closed, so it has somewhere to shrink back to.

**Repomind lives in a lane.** Starting repomind creates (once) a home repo at `~/repomind` - its memory: plans,
playbooks, per-repo notes, a journal - registers it like any other repo, and runs the agent in that repo's lane, marked
as the *controller lane*. Everything the app already does with a lane therefore works on it: the terminal bay renders
its pane, Multitasking lists its agents (under their own **Repomind** group in the pane picker rather than under a
project), and Supervision edits its policy like any lane's. That lane cannot be deleted or merged from the fleet tools,
and a worker agent cannot spawn into it. The one place it is treated differently is the fleet sidebar, which gives it
the pinned row described above instead of a project group.

**Supervision defaults.** The first time the home is ensured, the daemon seeds the controller lane with `hold` on the
destructive dialog classes (deletion, push to a remote, credential access, install, device access): a controller holds
the full fleet catalog, so a permission prompt in its lane is about the whole fleet rather than about one worktree.
Supervision itself stays off until you turn it on, exactly as for any other lane, and the seed is written once - relax a
class in **Settings > Policies > Supervision** and your choice survives every restart.

**The panel is a control room, not a second chat.** The conversation with a controller happens in its pane in the
terminal bay, which is a real terminal with scrollback, dialogs and colour; the panel holds the state that conversation
is about. It carries no composer, no live feed and no transcript, and every row here that names a controller ends in a
way back to its pane.

**The header** states the controller lane in the fleet's own vocabulary, the number of controllers in it, and the
lifecycle: **Start** or **Stop**, plus a **+** that spawns another controller into the lane up to the configured
maximum. The line under it names the lane and the home path on disk. Below that, five sections in one scrolling column:

- **Plans** lists one row per file in `plans/active`, with its title, its next step, its owner and when
  it last moved; clicking one opens that file in the editor on the home lane. **Add goal** takes a title
  and one line of intent, writes `plans/active/<slug>.md` in the home's frontmatter conventions, and then
  tells the primary controller the goal exists. A home with no controller running still gets its file,
  and the panel says so rather than pretending the handoff happened. **Done** on a row asks for a
  one-line outcome, then moves the file into `plans/done/` with `status: done` and that outcome appended.
- **Playbooks** is the approval gate. Drafts from `playbooks/drafts/` sit at the top with **Approve** and
  **Reject**; approved ones follow, each opening its file. Rejecting moves the draft into
  `playbooks/rejected/` rather than deleting it, so the text stays readable in the home's history. An
  approved playbook with a revision waiting appears on both lists: the approved text is what agents get,
  and the revision is still a decision you owe.
- **Standing duties** lists the schedules, each with its spec, its goal, its action cap, when it last ran
  and when it runs next, and **Remove** behind a confirmation. **Add** opens an inline form in the same
  section: a schedule, a goal, and an action cap, validated the way the daemon validates them.
- **Memory** answers whether the memory feeding all of this is current. The boot line says when the
  context was last assembled, how big it came out, and what the token budget left out, with
  **Regenerate** and **Open**. The export line says when the daemon's one-way export last ran, whether
  one is pending, and what failed if anything did, with **Export now**. Below them the journal browser
  picks a day out of `journal/` (newest first, with archived months behind a disclosure) and shows that
  day's entries, with **Open** for the day file itself.
- **Controllers** lists the agents in the lane with their status pill and the daemon's reason for it,
  each with **Focus pane**, which selects the lane and brings that controller's pane to the front of the
  terminal bay.

Every section reads the home through the ordinary lane file RPCs, because the home is an ordinary lane. They re-read
when the home's own counts move, when an export lands, or when you act on something here, never on a heartbeat of their
own.

**A controller between instructions reads idle.** A worker that stops talking is waiting to be picked up, so it reads
"needs you". A controller is a standing coordinator: sitting at the end of its turn is its resting state, and you do not
owe it an answer for that. "Needs you" on a controller therefore means a pending dialog or an explicit question, and
nothing else. The pinned sidebar row, the toolbar dot and this panel all read it the same way, from the attention word
the daemon puts on the session.

**What a fresh repomind already knows.** It does not start blank. Before every start, the daemon assembles a boot
document from the home and hands it to the agent, so the first thing in its head is your `REPOMIND.md` house rules,
whatever standing facts you keep in `profile/`, one line for each goal in `plans/active/` (its status, its owner, its
next step), yesterday's and today's journal, and a snapshot of every lane in the fleet with its branch, agent count, and
state. That means you can open a brand new repomind and ask "what goals are active" or "who needs me" and get a real
answer without it calling a single tool.

The document is capped at about 12k tokens; when your home outgrows that, the oldest journal goes first, then profile
notes, then plans, and the document says at the end exactly what it dropped.

It lives at `~/repomind/.repomind/boot.md`, is rewritten every time repomind starts, and is not yours to edit: change
the files it is built from instead. Day files in `journal/` older than 90 days roll into `journal/archive/`, so the
journal stays the recent past rather than everything that ever happened.

**Answering a controller's prompt.** A controller sometimes stops on something only you can answer, like Claude Code's
"Do you trust this folder?" trust prompt. That happens in its pane, and it is answered there: **Focus pane** in the
Controllers section puts the pane in front, where the full terminal, its dialog and its keys are. Supervision can also
answer routine classes for you, per lane, from **Settings > Policies > Supervision**.

## Git explorer

The git panel is another tab of the right-rail panel host (`mod+1`), scoped to the lane that is currently focused:
branch status against the repo's base branch (commits ahead, with diffstat), the working-tree's changed and untracked
files, and commit history. Clicking a working-tree file opens a unified diff for it; clicking a commit in Branch or
History opens that commit's detail (message, author, full patch) via the `commit.show` RPC. Opening a diff or a commit
replaces the panel's list views rather than nesting a second scroll region inside them; closing it returns to the list.

## In-app editor

The editor is the third tab of the right-rail panel host (`mod+2`): a lazy file tree over the focused lane's worktree,
multi-file tabs with dirty tracking, and a CodeMirror 6 editor themed to match every Repomon theme. Saving is
conflict-safe: if an agent (or anything else) changed the file on disk since it was opened, the save is rejected and a
banner offers **reload** (discard your edits and take the on-disk version) or **keep mine** (leave your buffer as-is,
still marked dirty, and try again) instead of silently overwriting either side. A file deleted on disk while you had it
open shows the same banner, offering to write your buffer back out as a fresh file.

Opening a `.pdf` shows the document itself rather than the "not a text file" notice: a slim toolbar (file name, size,
and an **Open in system viewer** button) over the webview's own PDF renderer, which handles paging and zoom natively on
macOS and Windows. The file is streamed straight off disk through the Tauri asset protocol - scoped, on first open, to
that lane's worktree root - rather than round-tripped through an RPC's base64 payload, so there is no size cap tied to
the editor's normal read limit. Linux's WebKitGTK webview has no built-in PDF renderer, so there the toolbar's button is
the only way to view the file; the same fallback appears on macOS and Windows if the preview fails or never finishes
loading. A PDF tab is always read-only: it is never marked dirty, never saved, and closes without a confirmation prompt.

## Extensions

The Extensions view manages Claude Code marketplaces, plugins, and skills, either globally or scoped to one repository.

It is account-aware. If you run more than one Claude account (a default `~/.claude` plus a variant such as
`~/.claude-work`), an account picker appears and every listing and action targets the account you choose. Codex is
listed too, but it uses a different extension model, so it shows an empty state rather than pretending to have
Claude-style plugins.

## Usage

`mod+3`, or the Usage button in the header, opens the usage ledger: what every managed agent burned in tokens, what
those tokens would cost at published API rates, and what is worth changing.

The ledger is local and passive. A background pass reads the transcripts the agents already write to disk (Claude Code's
`~/.claude/projects` and any `~/.claude-*` account root, Codex's `~/.codex/sessions`, Antigravity's brain transcripts,
and OpenCode's SQLite store), records one row per billable turn, and attributes each row to a repo and lane by the
directory the turn ran in. Nothing is sent anywhere and no API key is needed. Sessions repomon did not start still
appear, marked as running outside a lane.

Claude Code writes a subagent's turns to its own transcript, one directory below the session file at
`<project>/<session>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`. Those turns are read too and folded into the session that spawned
them: same lane, same repo, same row, with the sessions table's **Sub** column saying what share of the row's tokens the
subagents spent. It writes an assistant message as one line per content block, all repeating the same running `usage`,
so a message is counted once, at the highest figure its lines reported, rather than once per block.

A correction to how a transcript is counted also corrects the history already recorded: each source carries the reader
revision that read it, and ingest re-reads the ones an older revision wrote, replacing what they produced. That runs a
bounded number of sources per pass, so a fresh version converges over a few minutes rather than in one stall;
`usage.status` says how many sources are still waiting. The Usage view shows "Recounting N of M transcripts" while that
queue is nonempty. Each pass attempts at most 25 old sources and promptly schedules another pass when a full batch
leaves work. Missing or unsupported sources retain previous events and leave the queue. Unreadable sources retain their
events and resume offset; after three failed attempts at least a minute apart they also leave the queue, so progress
cannot stay stuck forever.

The view carries:

- Headline figures for the window: equivalent API cost first, then tokens and cache hit rate, with turns
  and the estimated share behind them.
- The window itself, spelled out under the controls: which range is on, and the dates it resolves to.
  **Today**, **7 days** and **30 days** are the named ranges; **Custom** opens a calendar for any two
  days, with **This month** and **Last month** as presets. The calendar is keyboard navigable: arrows
  walk days and weeks, PageUp and PageDown walk months, Enter takes a day. A named range means local
  calendar days, not UTC ones: "today" starts at midnight where you are, and "7 days" is the six local
  days before it plus today, which is the same way the agent CLIs report their own totals. The desktop
  resolves a named range in the browser's zone and sends the two instants outright; a client that sends
  only the name gets it resolved in the daemon's zone, which on a local install is the same one.
- A timeline of cost or tokens per bucket, stacked by whichever dimension the "Split by" control names,
  with a measure toggle above it. Every bucket in the window is drawn, empty ones included, so the axis
  is a timeline rather than a list of the hours that happened to be busy. Weekends are shaded on day
  buckets, hovering shows a crosshair and a readout (including "No usage"), and a legend entry isolates
  its series.
- Clicking a bar narrows the window to it: a day opens as hours, an hour as quarter hours. The breadcrumb
  above the chart puts the window it came from back.
- A breakdown table for that same dimension: agent, model, repo, lane or account.
- Findings: the top cost drivers, models reading at a low cache hit rate, sessions that spent many turns
  retrying, and light sessions that a cheaper model would have handled. A finding names its session by
  task rather than by identifier, links to that session's row, and folds repeats of the same shape into
  one line with a count and a total.
- A sessions table with the task headline pulled from the transcript, the lane named the way the sidebar
  names it, turns, tool calls, the subagent share, retries, duration, tokens and cost. Headings sort, and
  a row opens to the token split, the subagent tokens, the lane, and the window the session ran in.
  Clicking a session's lane focuses it.
- Export to CSV or JSON. The daemon writes the file under its data directory and names the path.

Numbers are formatted once, everywhere, including the CLI: tokens as k, M or B with one decimal ("12.6B", never
"12580.0M"); money as whole dollars above a thousand and cents below a hundred; durations with an empty unit dropped, so
three hours reads "3h".

A session's headline is the first thing the operator actually wrote. The extractor skips the blocks the CLIs inject into
a turn (`<local-command-caveat>`, `<system-reminder>`, `<USER_REQUEST>`, `<task-notification>`, `<agent-message>`) and
lines that are slash commands, takes the first real sentence, falls back to the first assistant sentence, and otherwise
says "untitled session". The raw turn is kept as the row's tooltip.

Costs are what the tokens would have cost on the provider's API. On a subscription plan such as Claude Max or Google AI
Pro that is the value the plan returned rather than an invoice, which is why the figure is labelled "equivalent API
cost" and sits beside the plan's own quota percentages on the sidebar's rate-limits card. A model with no published rate
still contributes its tokens and is named under the breakdown rather than quietly costing nothing. A free-tier model id
(one ending in `-free`) is priced at zero instead, because zero is its published rate.

Antigravity keeps no token counts anywhere the CLI can read, so its rows are estimated from content length at four
characters per token and counted in the "estimated" share.

### Configuring the ledger

The `[usage]` table in `~/.config/repomon/config.toml`:

- `enabled` (default `true`) turns ingest on and off.
- `scan_interval_secs` (default `600`) is the floor between full scans.
- `max_files_per_scan` (default `200`) bounds the work in one pass, newest files first.
- `refresh_prices` (default `true`) fetches LiteLLM's public price list once a day and caches it under
  the data directory. Set it to `false` to keep the ledger fully offline; the built-in rate table is
  always there as a floor either way.
- `[usage.price_overrides."<model>"]` corrects a rate. Every field is optional, so naming just
  `input_per_mtok` leaves the rest of that model's rates alone. Cost is computed at query time, so a
  correction re-prices history.

`repomon usage today|week|month`, `repomon usage report`, `repomon usage ingest` and `repomon usage status` answer the
same questions from a terminal, with `--group-by` and `--csv`.

The sidebar Rate limits card keeps its refresh control and reading age. To hide or show its Today cost row, use
**Settings > Usage > Show today's cost in the sidebar**. This preference is on by default, applies immediately, and
persists with the other sidebar preferences.

### Model rates in Settings

Open **Settings > Usage** to turn tracking or daily price refresh on and off, inspect price provenance, or refresh
prices now. The **Model rates** table includes every model the ledger has seen and every model with an override.
Unpriced rows come first by default; filter by model id or sort any column, including last seen and 30-day tokens. The
Usage view's unpriced warning opens this tab with the first unpriced model already in the filter.

Rates are USD per million tokens. Choose **Edit**, type only the rates you want to change, and save. Blank fields keep
the currently resolved value, including any existing override; zero explicitly sets a free rate. **Reset** removes the
entire override for that model. **Add model** accepts a model id or family prefix before its first run. Changes take
effect immediately, including costs for past usage, without restarting the daemon.

For the same model id, an override wins over the LiteLLM snapshot, then the built-in table. Resolution checks an exact
id first, then known aliases, then the longest matching family prefix. For example, `claude-haiku-4-5` can price
`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` when no exact row exists. A published exact row takes priority over a broader family
override; edit the exact id to correct it. A partial override inherits the other rates from the resolved row.

The CLI uses the same live config patches:

```sh
repomon usage rates set claude-sonnet-5 --output 9
repomon usage rates set future-model --input 2 --output 10 --cache-read 0.2 --cache-write 2.5
repomon usage rates reset claude-sonnet-5
```

### Where prices come from

A price is resolved in this order: `[usage.price_overrides]` first, then the daily LiteLLM snapshot, and the rate table
repomon ships with as the floor everything else falls back to.

A few model ids a CLI logs (a Codex internal review model, a tiered Gemini label) don't match a LiteLLM key by name; a
small alias table in `pricing.rs` maps those to the closest LiteLLM entry rather than leaving them on the generic
built-in rate.

A model unpriced right after a refresh gets one retry ten minutes later; if it's still unpriced after that, it stays
flagged rather than being retried forever.

The Usage view's pricing footnote and `repomon usage rates` both report where the active rates came from (LiteLLM,
overrides, built-in, and how many of each), when the snapshot was last fetched, and the last fetch's error if one is in
progress; a Refresh button (and `repomon usage rates --refresh`) forces an immediate fetch.

Turn the daily fetch off entirely with `refresh_prices = false` in `[usage]`. No other change is needed, and nothing
about the ledger itself requires network access.

## Known gaps

- Agent terminal panes can occasionally show visual corruption (garbled or stale rows). The v0.7.0
  rendering fixes eliminated the main causes, but rare cases remain. Workaround: resize the pane or
  window slightly, which forces a clean refit and redraw.
- Agent terminal screens can occasionally freeze and stop updating even though the agent is still running
  underneath. Workaround: quit and reopen the app; the tmux-backed session is durable, so nothing is lost
  and the pane comes back live.
- On Windows and Linux, `mod` is Ctrl, which is also the terminal's own control modifier. A bound Ctrl
  chord pressed while a terminal is focused currently fires the GUI action **and** reaches the agent.
  macOS is unaffected, since Cmd is not a terminal control key.
- Hiding a project can only be undone from Mission Control. The TUI honors the flag but has no reveal
  list, so it cannot unhide.
- The iOS companion app is built but unreleased.

## Permissions for agents

On macOS, grant Accessibility and Screen Recording to the app responsible for launching an
agent. A command that works in Terminal can still fail in a Repomon lane because Terminal's
grant is separate. In a measured Repomon lane, macOS attributed both requests to Repomon.app,
even though the lane's tmux server had detached under launchd.

1. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility** and enable the installed
   **Repomon.app**. Use the add button if it is missing.
2. Open **Screen & System Audio Recording** and enable Repomon for screen recording. Older
   macOS versions call this **Screen Recording**. If macOS asks for **Automation > System
   Events**, allow that separately for UI scripting.
3. Quit and reopen Repomon if macOS requests it, then test from a Repomon lane:

   ```sh
   osascript -e 'tell application "System Events"' -e 'set frontApp to first application process whose frontmost is true' -e 'tell frontApp to get count of windows' -e 'end tell'
   screencapture -x /tmp/repomon-permission-probe.png
   rm -f /tmp/repomon-permission-probe.png
   ```

   The first command returns a window count when Accessibility access works. The second
   creates a screen image; the third removes it. Merely asking System Events for a process
   name does not prove Accessibility access.

A locally rebuilt or replaced app can retain an enabled settings entry whose stored signing
requirement belongs to an older executable. If permission still fails, remove the stale
Repomon entry from each affected permission list and add the current app again. Detached
agent sessions can also retain the previous app's responsibility after its window closes.
Save work and finish active commands before restarting the fleet or logging out and back in;
reopening the window alone does not restart an existing tmux server.

| Launch context | Grant to check |
|---|---|
| Repomon app launched the lane's process tree | The current Repomon.app |
| Terminal started a fresh tmux server | Terminal |
| An independently installed daemon or another launcher started the fleet | The responsible app or executable reported for that process tree; do not assume Terminal's grant applies |

The observed failure was a stale ad hoc signing requirement, not evidence that tmux always
loses app attribution. Stable signed releases avoid tying the app's identity to one local
build. See Apple's [Accessibility](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh43185/mac)
and [Screen Recording](https://support.apple.com/en-mide/guide/mac-help/mchld6aa7d23/mac)
permission instructions and its [responsible-code and signing explanation](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/678819).

## Runtime socket recovery

Desktop daemon discovery shares the CLI's socket resolution: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/repomon.sock` when set,
otherwise `~/Library/Application Support/repomon/run/repomon.sock` on macOS or
`~/.local/share/repomon/run/repomon.sock` on Linux. `REPOMON_SOCKET` and the configured `socket_path` remain
supported. For one release, a live legacy default listener is used with a deprecation warning if the new
endpoint cannot be reached.

If a cleaner removes a running daemon's socket, its ten-minute watchdog recreates the listener and sends
`event.daemon.rebound`; established streams survive and desktop reconnection succeeds once the path is back.
The desktop uses the daemon's returned tmux attach command, including the explicit runtime socket or an
adopted legacy path. Restoring agents resumes saved Claude and Codex sessions and reports the result through
`event.notification`. An unreachable living tmux server blocks restoration rather than starting a second fleet.
