# Daemon protocol

JSON-RPC 2.0 over a Unix domain socket on macOS/Linux or a named pipe on Windows. Each message is length-prefixed: a
**4-byte little-endian `u32`** length, then that many bytes of UTF-8 JSON.

- **Socket:** `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/repomon.sock` when set; otherwise
  `~/Library/Application Support/repomon/run/repomon.sock` (macOS) or
  `~/.local/share/repomon/run/repomon.sock` (Linux), overridable
  via config or `--socket`.
- **Requests** carry an integer `id`; the daemon replies with a matching `Response`.
- **Events** are notifications (no `id`) with a method of the form `event.<topic>`. A client must send
  `subscribe` once to start receiving them.

Test it by hand on macOS: `nc -U "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-$HOME/Library/Application Support/repomon/run}/repomon.sock"`
and send framed JSON, or use the `repomon` CLI which speaks this protocol.

For one migration release, clients targeting the default endpoint try the old `/tmp/repomon-$USER.sock`
listener if the new endpoint is absent or refuses a connection, and log a deprecation warning. New daemons
always bind the resolved runtime endpoint; `--socket` and `socket_path` still override it.

Every ten minutes, the daemon checks its listener pathname against the device and inode captured when it
bound. If the pathname is removed, the still-running daemon binds a replacement listener at the same path,
closes its orphaned listener, and broadcasts `event.daemon.rebound` with `{ "socket": "<path>" }`. Existing
client streams remain connected; new connections work again after the watchdog tick. A live replacement
listener or non-socket file is not unlinked: recovery logs an error and retries on the next tick. Shutdown
removes only the socket this listener owns. Socket timestamps are refreshed daily.

Managed tmux servers use `-S <runtime-dir>/tmux/<session-name>` (normally `tmux/repomon`). Startup discovers
legacy servers by their socket and open descriptors, including sockets already unlinked by a cleaner.
A living legacy server is adopted in place; SIGUSR1 recreates a missing socket before any window creation.
The runtime path takes effect when that legacy server exits. If several processes retain the same socket
name, startup adopts the unique reachable server that actually owns the requested session. It logs
`adopting unique reachable tmux session owner; leaving other surviving servers untouched; replacement server creation remains guarded`
with the selected PID/path and preserved PIDs. It never signals the other survivors. Subsequent socket
recovery targets only the adopted PID after checking its process start time.

If there is no unique reachable owner, startup logs an error containing
`no unique reachable session owner; refusing recovery and fleet replacement` and the candidate PIDs/paths.
It does not create an empty replacement fleet. The operator should inspect the listed endpoints using
`tmux -N -S <path> list-sessions` and identify the intended fleet and any surviving panes before resolving
ambiguity. Do not send SIGUSR1 blindly to an old server sharing the active server's socket name: it could
replace that endpoint. An intentionally preserved, unreachable old server needs no action when one reachable
server owns the session. If both fleets are reachable, preserve their panes and deliberately retire or
separate the unwanted session before retrying; automatic fleet merging is outside this recovery path.

`agent.adopt` uses the supplied session id, or the lane's last stored id for its backend. Claude uses
`--resume <id>` and Codex uses `resume <id>`. Without a stored id they use `--continue` and `resume --last`,
respectively. Successful restores and blocked restores emit `event.notification` for desktop visibility.

## Remote transport (WebSocket)

Companion apps (the iOS client) reach the daemon over a **WebSocket bridge** speaking the exact same JSON-RPC envelopes
- one WS *text frame* per message, no length prefix. Disabled by default; `repomon remote enable` generates the legacy
shared bearer token, detects the Tailscale address, and writes `[remote] enabled/bind/token` to the config (apply with a
daemon restart).

- **Auth: per-device tokens.** `repomon remote pair --name <device>` mints that device its own named,
  individually revocable token (re-running it for the same name re-shows the same token rather than
  minting a second one; capped at 16 paired devices) and renders a
  `repomon://<host:port>#<token>&name=<device>` QR. `repomon remote devices` lists paired devices (name,
  role, created/last-seen - never the token); `repomon remote revoke <name>` revokes one, and a live
  connection authenticated with that token is kicked on its very next request with `-32000` `"device
  revoked"`. The legacy shared `[remote] token` from config still authenticates exactly as before (it
  isn't a row in `remote.devices`'s list - the CLI calls it out separately as the shared config token).
  `remote.pair`, `remote.devices`, and `remote.revoke` are themselves local-socket only: no client can
  mint or enumerate tokens over the same network it authenticates onto.
- **Checked before the WS upgrade completes** - `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header or a
  `?token=<token>` query parameter; anything else gets a 401 and no connection.
- **Bind it privately** (the Tailscale IP). Any paired device's token exercises the full allowlist below.
- `ping` → `"pong"` serves as an application-level keep-alive; events flow after `subscribe` exactly as
  on the Unix socket.
- **Method allowlist (default-deny), full fleet control:** paired devices can read the fleet, drive
  existing agents, AND spawn/stop/adopt agents and create/delete/merge lanes (`agent.spawn`,
  `agent.stop`, `agent.adopt`, `agent.detect`, `lane.create`, `lane.delete`, `lane.merge`, `lane.focus`,
  `lane.diff`), on top of everything previously allowed: reads, `agent.prompt`/`agent.answer` (verified
  dialog steering), `agent.watch_bytes`, `terminal.list_all`, `agent.fit`, and the orchestrator's
  status/transcript/send_input/key. Still blocked: daemon lifecycle (`daemon.shutdown`), machine
  diagnostics (`system.doctor`), config/secrets (`config.get`, `config.set`), host terminal + filesystem
  access (`terminal.open/close/target`, `fs.browse`), the worktree file-editor RPCs
  (`file.list`/`file.read`/`file.read_raw`/`file.write`, doubly so for `file.write` since it overwrites
  host files), `commit.show` (a caller-chosen oid can walk the entire repo history, unlike the
  already-allowed `lane.diff`), the blind `agent.resize` (only the arbitrated `agent.fit` is reachable
  remotely, since an unconditional remote resize is exactly what squeezed the TUI's mediated view), the
  orchestrator's `start`/`stop`/`watch`/`resize` (spawning/killing repomind and its pane geometry stay
  local), and credential minting (`remote.*`). Anything else answers `-32601` `"not permitted over remote
  bridge"`.
- **Per-connection viewports and byte watches.** Each connection (Unix socket or WebSocket) owns its own
  `viewport.set` state and its own `agent.watch_bytes` windows - an iPhone, an iPad, and the Mac TUI can
  each hold a different view (or watch the same window) at once without clobbering one another. The
  daemon polls and streams the *union* of every live connection's viewport. `event.agent.bytes` is
  delivered only to the connections watching that window; `event.agent.output` only to connections whose
  viewport covers the event's lane, or names its terminal window - a connection that never calls
  `viewport.set` receives no `event.agent.output` at all.
- **`agent.watch_bytes` is per-window and refcounted, not single-watch.** `on:true` starts (or joins) the
  shared backend stream for that window and always acks with `{ cols, rows }`, the pane's current grid. A
  connection may hold several windows at once; the same window watched by several connections shares one
  underlying stream, and that stream stops only once its last watcher leaves. `on:false` with a `window`
  releases just that window for this connection; `on:false` without a `window` releases every window this
  connection watches for the lane.
- **Fit arbitration.** A local (TUI) session's fresh viewport focus always owns a window's size. Among
  remote sessions actively focused on the same window, the one that most recently drove the agent
  (`agent.send_input`/`signal`/`key`/`scroll`/`answer`, or an applied `agent.fit`) wins. Both kinds of
  ownership decay: the TUI heartbeats its viewport every ~5s and a focus lapses 15s after the last beat,
  so a crashed or closed client's hold releases within seconds. The unconditional `agent.resize` stays
  local-only regardless of who's connected.

## Methods

| Method | Params | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `repo.list` | - | `[Repo]` |
| `repo.add` | `{ path }` | `Repo` |
| `repo.remove` | `{ repo_id }` | `null` |
| `repo.discover` | `{ root, max_depth=4 }` | `[String]` (repo paths) |
| `lane.list` | - | `[Lane]` (each lane carries `role`: `null` for an ordinary work lane, `"controller"` for the repomind home lane. Agent sessions overlaid; each session may carry `pending_dialog`, `stale`/`stalled_since`, and `gate` - the worktree's latest dxkit stop-gate verdict `{ allowed, net_new_findings, at, session_id? }`, tailed from `.dxkit/loop/ledger.jsonl` when the lane runs dxkit's loop pack. A fresh `allowed` grants the done-candidate attention; a fresh block vetoes it) |
| `lane.get` | `{ lane_id }` | `Lane` |
| `lane.create` | `CreateLaneParams` | `Lane` |
| `lane.delete` | `{ lane_id, also_delete_branch=false }` | `null` |
| `lane.focus` | `{ lane_id }` | `{ path }` |
| `lane.merge` | `{ lane_id, into? }` | `{ message }` |
| `lane.diff` | `{ lane_id, include_patch=false, max_patch_chars=8000 }` | `LaneDiff` - commits ahead of the repo's base branch (with diffstat) plus uncommitted state; see below |
| `message.send` | `{ to: string \| string[], body, reply_to? }` - `to` also accepts `"lane-N/*"` or `"*"` | `FleetMessage` for a single plain address; a per-recipient fan-out summary (`{ recipient_count, sent_count, results: [{ to, status, message_id?, thread_id?, error? }] }`) for a list or wildcard `to` (local socket only; see `docs/messaging.md`) |
| `message.inbox` | `{ unread_only=false, limit=50, before? }` | `MessagePage`; returned queued rows become delivered (local socket only) |
| `message.mark_read` | `{ id }` | `FleetMessage` (local socket only) |
| `message.list` | `{ lane_id?, unread_only=false, limit=50, before? }` | `MessagePage`, newest first (local socket only) |
| `commit.today` | - | `[Commit]` (live, all repos) |
| `commit.range` | `{ from_iso, to_iso, repo_ids? }` | `[Commit]` |
| `commit.search` | `{ query, limit=50 }` | `[Commit]` (indexed) |
| `commit.recent` | `{ lane_id? \| repo_id?, limit=8 }` | `[Commit]` (latest on the worktree/repo HEAD, any date) |
| `commit.show` | `{ lane_id, oid, max_patch_chars=8000 }` | `CommitShow`, one commit's full metadata (`oid` resolved to the full 40-char hash, `author_name`, `author_email`, `time`, `summary`, `body`) plus `patch` (capped, char-boundary safe, `max_patch_chars` server-clamped to 20000) and `stat`; `patch_truncated` set when cut. Backs the git explorer's commit-detail view. Local socket only (a caller-chosen `oid` can walk the entire repo history, a broader read surface than `lane.diff`). |
| `timeline` | `{ from_iso, to_iso, bucket_secs=3600 }` | `TimelineData` |
| `sessions` | `{ from_iso, to_iso }` | `[WorkSession]` |
| `agent.detect` | none | `[AgentChoice]` (one Claude entry per config dir + codex/hermes/opencode/antigravity/aider/cursor + config customs; `default` flags the configured default) |
| `agent.adopt` | `{ lane_id, session_id?, agent? }` | `{ lane_id, window }` (take over an external session; every agent kind is adoptable. Claude, Hermes, OpenCode, and Antigravity resume that exact identity/session with their resume flag; Codex, Cursor, Aider, and custom agents have no session-resume flag, so adopting relaunches the same command fresh in the worktree instead. Omitted `agent` retains account-aware Claude behavior) |
| `agent.add` | `{ name, command }` | `null` (upsert a custom agent; rejects built-in names; persists to config.toml) |
| `agent.remove` | `{ name }` | `null` (drop a custom agent; clears it as default; rejects built-ins) |
| `agent.set_default` | `{ name? }` | `null` (set/clear the New Lane default; `name` may be a built-in or custom) |
| `agent.spawn` | `{ lane_id, agent, task?, effort?, mode?, model?, identity_token? }` | `{ lane_id, window, agent, role? }`. `role` is `"controller"` when `lane_id` is the repomind controller lane, and absent otherwise. A controller is launched with `REPOMON_MCP_MODE=orchestrator` (the full fleet catalog) and counted against `[repomind] max_controllers`; `identity_token` is the caller's own MCP identity, and a caller whose identity belongs to another lane is refused with `invalid_params` when it targets the controller lane. |
| `agent.capture` | `{ lane_id, lines?, window?, include_state=false }` | `{ content }` normally. With `include_state=true`, also returns `{ alternate, cols, rows, cursor?, generation?, sequence?, stable }` as a terminal checkpoint. A sequenced client must only resume with stream chunks after the checkpoint cursor and recapture when `stable=false`. |
| `agent.transcript` | `{ lane_id, session_id?, limit=50 }` | `[TranscriptItem]` - `{ role, text, at? }` with role `user`/`assistant`/`tools`; full unwrapped message text for clients that lay text out themselves (the mobile chat view). Claude sessions only (empty otherwise). |
| `agent.transcript_page` | `{ lane_id, window?, session_id?, kind?, before? }` | `{ items: [TranscriptItem], next_before: number?, page_count, older_message_count?, order, removed_ids }`. Claude, Codex, Antigravity and OpenCode use their transcript source; other kinds use an explicit `terminal_block` pane excerpt. `window` is authoritative: a contradictory `kind` or `session_id`, or an unavailable/foreign-lane window, returns `invalid_params` (-32602), never a fallback success. Omit `session_id` for window-only addressing; `win:<window>` must match that exact window. Session-only historical reads remain supported. `next_before` is an opaque exclusive cursor, not bytes scanned; pass it as `before` to prepend earlier rows. |
| `agent.transcript_watch` | `{ lane_id, window?, session_id?, kind?, on=true }` | Returns the newest page plus `activity`, `input_states` and authoritative `order`; subsequent `event.agent.transcript` notifications carry ordered upserts and `removed_ids`. Selector validation is identical to `agent.transcript_page` and precedes replacing a watch. `order` includes unchanged IDs in the complete current window; retain loaded older IDs before this suffix, without timestamp sorting. `activity` is null or nullable `verb`, `elapsed_seconds`, `token_count`, `thought_seconds`, `model`, `effort` fields. `input_states` replaces the map of stable user IDs to `sent`, `queued` or `consumed`; pane-proved consumption may precede persistence. Durable consumption upserts the same ID, clears `partial` and removes its state. `on:false` returns null and stops the specified window, or every watch for the lane if window is omitted. |
| `agent.send_input` | `{ lane_id, text, enter=true, window? }` | `null` (types text, then Enter unless `enter=false`; `window` targets one agent in a multi-agent lane) |
| `agent.key` | `{ lane_id, key, literal=false, window? }` | `null` (one keystroke: literal char or key name; `window` targets one agent in a multi-agent lane) |
| `agent.signal` | `{ lane_id, key, window? }` | `null` |
| `agent.watch_bytes` | `{ lane_id, window?, on }` | on `on: true`, `{ cols, rows, generation, sequence }`; `null` on `off`. Streams the pane's raw PTY bytes as `event.agent.bytes`, delivered only to connections watching that window. Every chunk carries the same generation and a contiguous sequence. A gap or generation change invalidates cursor-relative emulator state and requires a fresh sequenced `agent.capture` checkpoint. Per-connection and refcounted, not single-watch: a window has one shared backend stream no matter how many connections watch it; this connection may watch several windows at once. `on:false` with a `window` releases just that one; `on:false` without a `window` releases every window this connection watches for the lane. A matching `event.agent.stream_closed` means the target window died and the client must release its local watch. Render at the authoritative grid from the ack or `agent.fit`. |
| `agent.prompt` | `{ lane_id, window? }` | `{ dialog: PendingDialog\|null }` - fresh pane capture parsed for the interactive dialog actually on screen right now (never the sniff cache). `PendingDialog` = `{ title?, question, body?: [String], options: [{ number?, text }], selected? }`; `lane.list` carries the same object on `AgentSession.pending_dialog` alongside the `pending_prompt` summary. |
| `agent.answer` | `{ lane_id, choice, window?, expect_summary? }` | `{ answered, sent }` - re-captures the pane, verifies a dialog is still up (and, when `expect_summary` is set, that it still summarizes to that string), then steers to `choice` (0-based) and confirms. On a stale view it does NOT send anything: error `-32010` (`no pending dialog` / `dialog changed`) with `error.data.dialog` carrying what's actually on screen (possibly `null`) so the client re-renders instead of re-fetching. Any input path (`send_input`/`key`/`signal`/`answer`) drops the window's sniff-cache entry, so an answered dialog can't be re-advertised for the rest of its TTL. |
| `agent.stop` | `{ lane_id, window? }` | `null` (stops one specific agent window; `None` = the lane's first slot) |
| `agent.pin` | `{ lane_id, pinned }` | `null` |
| `session.rename` | `{ session_id, label? }` | `null` (set/clear a user label for a session, keyed by its durable transcript id; empty/absent `label` clears it; overlaid onto `AgentSession.custom_label`) |
| `agent.target` | `{ lane_id, window? }` | `{ target, available, attach? }` (also resets the window to follow the attaching client's size; `attach` - optional, additive - is `{ program, args }`, the exact command to run in a real terminal to attach; clients without it keep deriving the tmux invocation from `target`) |
| `agent.resize` | `{ lane_id, cols, rows, window? }` | `null` (resize the agent's pane so the mediated view reflows to fit; clamped to a floor) |
| `agent.fit` | `{ lane_id, cols, rows, window? }` | `{ applied, cols, rows }` - the arbitrated resize for remote viewers: reflows the shared pane to the caller's grid ONLY while no live local viewport focus owns the window (the TUI heartbeats its viewport every ~5s; ownership lapses 15s after the last beat, and a clean TUI quit releases it immediately) AND no other remote session that's also focused on this window right now drove the agent more recently than the caller (last-interaction-wins among remotes; an applied fit counts as an interaction). Refused (`applied: false`) it answers with the pane's current grid so the caller renders pinned at the shared size instead of fighting. Poll it (~10s) to adapt when the TUI starts or stops viewing. |
| `agent.scroll` | `{ lane_id, up, ticks=1, window?, col=1, row=1 }` | `{ forwarded }`. Forward wheel ticks to the live alternate-screen application. On tmux, snapshot the pane ID and mouse modes per gesture and encode SGR, UTF-8 or legacy mouse bytes accordingly; missing target, disabled mouse reporting, copy mode or normal screen returns `forwarded:false` so the client scrolls its own buffer. A target lost after the probe returns an error instead of claiming successful delivery. |
| `terminal.open` | `{ lane_id }` | `{ id, target, attach? }` (a new plain shell window in the worktree; `attach` as in `agent.target`) |
| `terminal.list` | `{ lane_id }` | `[String]` (open terminal window names for the lane) |
| `terminal.list_all` | - | `[{ lane_id, id }]` (every lane's open terminals, sorted - what the Grid tiles) |
| `terminal.close` | `{ id }` | `null` |
| `terminal.target` | `{ id }` | `{ target, available, attach? }` (`attach` as in `agent.target`) |
| `fs.browse` | `{ path? }` | `BrowseResult` (subdirs, repos, added flags) |
| `file.list` | `{ lane_id, path? }` | `FileListResult`: `{ entries: [FileEntry], truncated }`, one directory level of the lane's worktree (`path` relative to the worktree root, omitted lists the root); `FileEntry` = `{ name, path, is_dir, size, ignored }` (`ignored` from a batched `git check-ignore`; `.git` itself is never listed). Backs the in-app editor's lazy file tree. Local socket only, like `fs.browse`. |
| `file.read` | `{ lane_id, path }` | `FileReadResult`: `{ content, mtime_ms, size, truncated, kind, large }`; `kind` is "text", "binary", "image", or "pdf" (SVG is treated as text for CodeMirror editing; raster images are "image"; `.pdf` is classified before the binary sniff, with empty `content` - the editor streams the file itself via the Tauri asset protocol instead of reading it through this RPC); `large` is true when file size exceeds 2 MiB (opens read-only in editor); rejects (does not truncate) a file over the 8 MiB read cap so the editor never silently saves back a partial copy. `mtime_ms` round-trips into `file.write`'s `expected_mtime_ms`. Local socket only. |
| `file.read_raw` | `{ lane_id, path }` | `FileReadRawResult`: `{ base64, mime, size }`; returns base64-encoded file payload and MIME type under the same 8 MiB read cap. Used for Markdown images and as an image-viewer fallback; the image viewer primarily streams via the Tauri asset protocol. Local socket only. |
| `file.write` | `{ lane_id, path, content, expected_mtime_ms? }` | `FileWriteResult`: `{ mtime_ms, size }`; given `expected_mtime_ms`, rejected with a conflict error unless the on-disk mtime still matches (omitted = last-write-wins). Broadcasts `event.file.changed`. Local socket only, doubly so since it overwrites host files. |
| `file.index` | `{ lane_id }` | `FileIndexResult`: `{ paths: [string], truncated: bool, generation: number }`; recursive list of non-ignored worktree relative file paths, files only, capped at 50,000 entries. Cached in daemon memory per lane with generation bumped on watcher events and writes. Local socket only. |
| `file.create` | `{ lane_id, path, is_dir? }` | `FileCreateResult`: `{ path, is_dir }`; creates an empty file or directory. Parent directories created automatically. Rejects with `-32009` if target already exists. Broadcasts `event.file.changed` with `op: "created"`. Local socket only. |
| `file.rename` | `{ lane_id, from, to }` | `FileRenameResult`: `{ from, to }`; renames or moves a path within worktree. Rejects with `-32009` if destination exists. Broadcasts `event.file.changed` with `op: "renamed"`. Local socket only. |
| `file.delete` | `{ lane_id, path, recursive? }` | `FileDeleteResult`: `{ path }`; deletes file or directory. Refuses root and `.git`. Non-empty directory requires `recursive: true` or rejects with `-32008`. Broadcasts `event.file.changed` with `op: "removed"`. Local socket only. |
| `file.search` | `{ lane_id, query, regex?, case_sensitive?, glob?, max_results? }` | `FileSearchResult`: `{ query, hits: [{ path, line, column, preview }], truncated }`; search file contents across non-ignored worktree files, skipping binaries and files over 2 MiB. Cap at `max_results` (default 200, hard cap 2000). Local socket only. |
| `file.diff_base` | `{ lane_id, path }` | `FileDiffBaseResult`: `{ content: string | null, kind: "text" \| "binary" \| "missing" }`; returns the HEAD version of the path via `git show HEAD:<path>` in the lane worktree (`missing` for untracked or newly added files, `binary` by the same null-byte sniff as `file.read`, same 8 MiB cap). Local socket only. |
| `viewport.set` | `{ lane_ids, focus_lane?, focus_window?, windows? }` | `null` (`focus_lane`/`focus_window` pick which agent window the focused lane streams; others stream their first slot. `windows` names plain-terminal windows - `term-{lane}-{n}` - to stream as extra panes alongside the lanes, e.g. the Grid's shell tiles; non-terminal names are ignored. Per-connection: each connection owns its own viewport and focus; the capture loop streams the union across every live connection, and `event.agent.output` is filtered to the connections whose viewport actually covers it) |
| `subscribe` | `{ topics? }` | `null` |
| `ping` | - | `"pong"` (remote keep-alive / connectivity probe) |
| `remote.pair` | `{ name }` | `{ name, token, url }` - mints (or, for a name already paired, re-shows) that device's own revocable token and its `repomon://` pairing URL. Capped at 16 paired devices. Local socket only. |
| `remote.devices` | - | `[{ name, role, created_at, last_seen_at? }]` - never includes the token. Local socket only. |
| `remote.revoke` | `{ name }` | `{ revoked }` - `true` if a device by that name existed; drops it from the auth cache so live connections holding its token are kicked on their next request. Local socket only. |
| `push.register` | `{ device_token }` | `null` (register an APNs device for push; idempotent) |
| `push.unregister` | `{ device_token }` | `null` |
| `daemon.status` | - | `{ uptime_secs, repos, lanes, db_size_bytes, version, protocol_revision, capabilities }`; terminal checkpoint and stream-sequence support is advertised in `capabilities`. |
| `daemon.shutdown` | - | `null` |
| `system.doctor` | - | `SystemDoctorResult`: `{ tmux: TmuxDoctorInfo, git: GitDoctorInfo, agents: [AgentDoctorInfo] }`, a machine-health snapshot backing Settings > System. `TmuxDoctorInfo` = `{ available, version?, source?, path? }` with `source` one of `"system"`/`"bundled"` (the portable tmux sidecar shipped with the app); `GitDoctorInfo` = `{ available, version?, path? }`; `AgentDoctorInfo` = `{ kind, name, command, detected }` per configured/built-in agent CLI. Local socket only. |
| `usage.get` | - | `[AccountUsage]` (per agent account, scraped from Claude `/usage` and Codex `/status`; empty unless `usage_probe` is enabled and a local desktop or TUI client is active) |
| `orchestrator.status` | - | `{ running, agent?, model?, backend?, window?, autonomy?, session_id?, attention, headline? }` (the primary controller in the repomind lane; reconciles against its session backend, so a window killed externally reports `running:false`) |
| `orchestrator.transcript` | `{ limit? }` | `[TranscriptItem]` (repomind's conversation, same `{ role, text, at? }` shape as `agent.transcript`, so a client can render it as a chat instead of mirroring the pane; pinned to the orchestrator's own `session_id` when known, else falls back to the newest `$HOME` Claude transcript with real content across accounts. Always `[]` while `backend` is `"codex"`, `"antigravity"`, or `"opencode"` (none of their on-disk session formats are parsed); treat it as "no chat view for this backend" and render the `event.orchestrator.output` pane stream instead, never as an error/loading state) |
| `orchestrator.start` | `{ agent?, model?, autonomy?, max_agents?, prompt? }` | `{ running, agent?, model?, backend?, window?, autonomy?, session_id?, attention, headline? }` (ensure the repomind home repo and its controller lane, then spawn or adopt the primary controller in that lane's window, wired to the repomon MCP server with `REPOMON_MCP_MODE=orchestrator`; idempotent; re-spawns if the prior window died. `agent` picks the backend: a Claude account / custom agent name, `codex`, `antigravity`/`agy`, or `opencode`/`open-code`, defaulting to `[repomind] primary_agent` then `orchestrator_agent`; an agent with no MCP client for orchestration (e.g. `aider` or `cursor`) is rejected with `invalid_params` instead of spawning a broken window) |
| `orchestrator.stop` | - | `{ running:false, attention:"none", headline:null, … }` (**deprecated** alias: kill the controller lane's window) |
| `orchestrator.target` | - | `{ target, available, attach? }` (**deprecated** alias: attach target for the controller window; resets it to follow the attaching client's size; `attach` as in `agent.target`) |
| `orchestrator.send_input` | `{ text, enter=true }` | `null` (**deprecated** alias for `agent.send_input` on the controller window: type an instruction to repomind, then Enter unless `enter=false`) |
| `orchestrator.key` | `{ key, literal=false }` | `null` (**deprecated** alias for `agent.key`: one keystroke to repomind, literal char or key name) |
| `orchestrator.watch` | `{ on }` | `null` (**deprecated** alias: gate the pane stream; the TUI sets it `true` while the command-center view is open and `false` on leaving) |
| `orchestrator.resize` | `{ cols, rows }` | `null` (**deprecated** alias: size the controller window to the viewer's pane so its capture reflows to fit; clamped to a floor) |
| `repomind.status` | - | [`RepomindStatus`](../apps/desktop/src/bindings/RepomindStatus.ts): `{ home, exists, repo_id?, lane_id?, window?, max_controllers, export, counts, boot }` (read-only: where the repomind home repo lives, whether it is on disk yet, which repo/lane represent it, the controller lane's last recorded tmux window, and the controller cap. `export` is `{ last_run?, pending, last_error? }`: when the one-way export last ran, whether a write is waiting for its 5 s debounce, and the last failure. `counts` is `{ active_plans, standing, playbooks, drafts }`, read from `plans/active/`, `plans/standing/`, `playbooks/`, and `playbooks/drafts/` (each directory's own `README.md` never counts). `boot` is `{ generated_at?, tokens_estimate, trimmed }`: when `.repomind/boot.md` was last assembled, its size in the budget's four-characters-per-token units, and the home-relative paths the budget forced out of it (all zero/empty before the first regeneration). Never creates anything) |
| `repomind.boot` | - | `{ path, bytes, tokens_estimate, trimmed }` (**local-only**: reassemble the daemon-owned boot context at `<home>/.repomind/boot.md` and report what it produced. `path` is absolute, `bytes` the document's size on disk, `tokens_estimate` its size in the budget's units, and `trimmed` the home-relative paths the budget forced out, least important first. Every spawn into the controller lane regenerates it too, so this is for seeing what a controller would be handed right now) |
| `repomind.export` | - | `{ files, kinds }` (**local-only**: run the one-way export now instead of waiting out the debounce. `files` are the home-relative paths written or removed, `kinds` the record kinds they belong to (`journal`, `schedules`, `approvals`, `notes`, `playbooks`), which also form the commit subject `chore(repomind): export <kinds>`. Empty when nothing changed. Silently a no-op when the home does not exist) |
| `repomind.instruct` | `{ text }` | `{ outcome, window, entry_id?, reason? }` (**local-only**: type one instruction into the primary controller's composer, using the same verified injection as fleet mail and the boot line. The text is squashed onto one line and framed as `[REPOMIND] <text> [END REPOMIND]`, whose closing sentinel is the delivery marker. `outcome` is `"sent"`, `"skipped"` (the composer was busy or a dialog was up, with `reason` naming which), or `"failed"`. Refuses with `invalid_params` when the text is empty, when the home has no controller lane, or when no controller is running: an instruction that went nowhere is reported, never dropped quietly) |
| `playbook.reject` | `{ name }` | `{ name, path, status }` (**local-only**: the other half of the human approval gate. Moves `playbooks/drafts/<name>.md` to `playbooks/rejected/<name>.md` with `status: rejected` and a `rejected` stamp in its frontmatter. It never deletes: the text stays on disk and in the home's git history, and rejecting a revision leaves the approved playbook standing. `path` is home-relative. `invalid_params` when no draft by that name exists) |

The daemon exports its own records into the home one way and commits each batch there as `Repomind <repomind@local>`:
journal rows become `journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md` sections keyed by row id in an HTML comment, schedules become
`plans/standing/<slug>.md`, and the approval rules become `profile/approvals.md`. Exports are debounced 5 s behind a
journal, schedule, or approval-rule write, and commits are batched at most once a minute; nothing outside those targets
is written, and a home that is not a git repo simply skips the commit. Repo notes (`fleet/<repo>/notes.md`) and
playbooks (`playbooks/<name>.md`, drafts under `playbooks/drafts/`) are file-first: the `repo.notes.*` and `playbook.*`
RPCs read and write those files directly, approving a playbook moves its file up out of `drafts/`, and rejecting one
moves it sideways into `playbooks/rejected/` rather than deleting it. A daemon start migrates anything that still only
exists in SQLite or the app-support `repo-notes/` directory into the home, and never deletes the original.

At spawn the daemon assembles `<home>/.repomind/boot.md` and hands it to the controller: the operator's `REPOMIND.md`
overlay whole, `profile/*.md` bodies with their frontmatter stripped, one status line per `plans/active/*.md`,
yesterday's and today's journal day files, and a fleet snapshot of one line per lane (repo, lane, branch, agent count,
most urgent state).

The whole document is bounded by `[repomind] boot_budget_tokens` (12k by default, estimated at four characters to a
token); over budget it drops the journal first, then profile notes, then plans, and ends with a `Trimmed: ...` line
naming exactly what went.

Claude receives it as `--append-system-prompt-file <path>` on top of the shipped persona (which stays the system
prompt); OpenCode receives the file through its `instructions` configuration; Codex and Antigravity get a first typed
line pointing at the file, delivered through the same verified-composer injection fleet mail uses so it never types over
a busy composer.

The file is daemon-owned and gitignored: never hand-edit it.

Repomind runs in the **controller lane**, the main worktree of the repomind home repo (`~/repomind` by default,
`[repomind] home`). It is registered like any other repo, and its lane carries `role: "controller"` in `lane.list`. Its
window is therefore an ordinary `lane-*` window and does appear in `lane.list`, the lane overlay, and the reaper. The
old daemon-owned `orchestrator` window is kept only as an adoption fallback, so a window left behind by a pre-R1 daemon
is adopted rather than duplicated.

Every `orchestrator.*` RPC above except `.status`/`.transcript`/`.start` is a **deprecated** thin alias onto the
controller lane's window:

| Deprecated alias | Replacement | Removal target |
|---|---|---|
| `orchestrator.stop` | `agent.stop` | the release after next |
| `orchestrator.target` | `agent.target` | the release after next |
| `orchestrator.send_input` | `agent.send_input` | the release after next |
| `orchestrator.key` | `agent.key` | the release after next |
| `orchestrator.watch` | `viewport.set` | the release after next |
| `orchestrator.resize` | `agent.resize` | the release after next |

Prefer `lane.list` plus the `agent.*`/`viewport.set` RPCs, which work on the controller lane's window like any other
agent's; find the window itself from `lane.list`'s `role: "controller"` row or from `repomind.status`'s `window`. Each
deprecated alias's handler logs one `tracing::warn!` naming its replacement the first time it is called in the daemon
process's lifetime (not on every call, since some of these sit on a hot path), so an operator or client author watching
the daemon log gets one nudge to move off it before it is removed.

`attention` on the orchestrator payloads above is always present: one of `"none"`, `"permission"`, `"decision"`,
`"end_of_turn"`. `headline` is non-null only alongside `permission`/`decision` (the open dialog's question) or
`end_of_turn` (a tail of repomind's last message, when cheaply available); always `null` when `attention` is `"none"`.

`backend` is the normalized agent CLI the session runs on: `"claude"`, `"codex"`, `"antigravity"`, or `"opencode"`
(`null` when not running), and is what clients should switch rendering on (`agent` is the raw launch name, e.g.
`claude-work`). Claude is the only backend with a parseable on-disk transcript; a `"codex"`, `"antigravity"`, or
`"opencode"` session is monitored best-effort from its pane only: `orchestrator.transcript` is always `[]`, `attention`
never reports `"end_of_turn"` (pane dialogs may still surface `permission`/`decision`), and `session_id` is always
`null`.

`autonomy` is the level the running session was actually started with (the value passed to, or defaulted by,
`orchestrator.start`). It is `null` when the daemon *adopted* a window that survived a restart of a previous daemon
process - the adopting process has no record of what autonomy that window was originally launched with, so it reports
unknown rather than guessing.

`session_id` is the UUID the running session's `claude` was launched with (`--session-id`, minted fresh by the daemon at
spawn time), which pins `orchestrator.transcript` and the end-of-turn attention check to *this* session's own transcript
file - instead of guessing "the newest `$HOME` transcript", which misattributes any other active Claude session on the
machine as repomind's. Like `autonomy`, it is `null` when the daemon *adopted* a surviving window: the prior process's
session id lived only in its own memory, so an adopted session falls back to the old newest-with-content heuristic.
Always `null` for a `"codex"`, `"antigravity"`, or `"opencode"` backend (none has an equivalent of `--session-id`, and
none of their session files are parsed; the fallback heuristic is deliberately NOT applied there, since it would
misattribute an unrelated Claude session's transcript).

**Remote bridge:** of the orchestrator methods above, `status`/`transcript`/`send_input`/`key` are allowed over the
WebSocket bridge (read + interact, like their `agent.*` equivalents); `start`/`stop`/`watch`/`resize` are Unix-socket
only - spawning or killing repomind, and its pane-geometry plumbing, stay local.

`CreateLaneParams`: `{ repo_id, branch, source_branch?, path?, copy_files? }`.

`LaneDiff` (the result of `lane.diff`): `{ base, merge_base, commits, commits_truncated?, committed_stat,
uncommitted_stat, untracked, patch?, patch_truncated? }`. `base` is the repo's main checkout's current branch name;
`merge_base` a short hash of `git merge-base HEAD <base>`; `commits` is `git log --oneline <merge_base>..HEAD`,
newline-joined and capped at 20 lines (`commits_truncated: true` present only when there were more). `committed_stat` is
`git diff --stat <merge_base>..HEAD`; `uncommitted_stat` is `git diff HEAD --stat` (staged + unstaged). `untracked` is
the lane's untracked-file *count* only, computed live alongside the stats (one snapshot is self-consistent) - untracked
file **contents** never appear in `patch` or either `*_stat` field. `patch` (`git diff HEAD` text, capped at
`max_patch_chars`, char-boundary safe) and `patch_truncated: true` are present only when `include_patch: true` and the
patch was actually cut; `max_patch_chars` is server-clamped to a ceiling of 20000. Errors (`-32000`) when the base
branch shares no common history with `HEAD`, or the repo's main checkout has no current branch (detached HEAD). Allowed
over the remote bridge - it joined the allowlist with the rest of fleet control (see "Remote transport" above).

`AccountUsage`: `{ key, label, report: UsageReport, age_secs }` - `key` is how a client attributes usage to the focused
agent: a Claude agent's config dir (`"default"` for `~/.claude`), or `"codex"`. `UsageReport`: `{ windows: [UsageWindow]
}`. `UsageWindow`: `{ label, pct_used, reset_at? }` - one limit window, normalized to **% used** across agents (Codex's
"% left" is converted). `label` is a short tag (`5h`, `wk`, `mo`, or a model name); windows are ordered shortest-first
and only present when readable (a partial parse still returns what it could).

## Events

| Topic | Params |
|---|---|
| `event.daemon.rebound` | `{ socket }` - the daemon recreated its lost listener pathname; existing accepted streams remain connected. |
| `event.repo.added` | `{ repo }` |
| `event.repo.removed` | `{ repo_id }` |
| `event.repo.changed` | `{ path, kind? }` |
| `event.lane.created` | `{ lane }` |
| `event.lane.deleted` | `{ lane_id }` |
| `event.agent.status` | `{ lane_id, status }` |
| `event.agent.output` | `{ lane_id, window, content, cursor? }` (`window` names the tmux window the capture came from - a `lane-*` agent pane or a `term-*` plain terminal, so one lane can stream both without colliding; `cursor` is `[col, row]` - the pane's text-cursor position, 0-based from the pane's top-left - sent only for the focused pane when its cursor is visible; `null`/absent otherwise) |
| `event.agent.bytes` | `{ lane_id, window, data, generation, sequence }` - raw PTY bytes (base64) from the byte-watched pane. Chunks are arbitrary byte boundaries, so feed them to a terminal emulator rather than parsing them as individual UTF-8 strings. Sequence values are contiguous within one generation. |
| `event.agent.stream_closed` | `{ lane_id, window, generation }` - the backend stream ended because the watched target disappeared. Release local watch state only when `generation` matches the active stream; delayed notifications from an older generation are stale. |
| `event.agent.changed` | `{ name }` or `{ default }` (a custom agent was added/removed, or the default changed) |
| `event.file.changed` | `{ lane_id, path }`, a worktree file was saved through `file.write` (so other viewers of the same file can reload). |
| `event.notification` | `{ lane_id, session_id?, kind, title, body, prompt?, attention, dialog? }` - daemon-side agent alert (kinds: `needs_you`, `rate_limited`, `resumed`, `idle`, `stalled`; `prompt` is the agent's pending question verbatim). `attention` refines `needs_you`: `permission` (routine tool-call ask) / `decision` (a real question) / `done_candidate` (turn finished on a clean lane with a this-turn commit - ready to review) / `end_of_turn` (turn finished, no dialog) / `none`; `dialog` is the full `PendingDialog` when one is on screen, so an actionable client can offer its real options. `stalled` fires once when a managed agent's pane and transcript both freeze mid-work for ~5 min while its process lives (see `AgentSession.stale`/`stalled_since` on `lane.list` - additive overlay fields, with `stalled_since` marking the pane's last change). Emitted to every subscribed client. When `[remote]` is enabled, the same alert also goes to APNs devices with category `AGENT_PROMPT` (actionable) or `AGENT_ALERT`. |
| `event.message.stored` | `{ id, lane_id?, from, body, message }` for one newly accepted durable fleet message. Clients deduplicate only by `id`. |
| `event.orchestrator.output` | `{ content, cursor? }` - the repomind pane's text (and `[col, row]` cursor) streamed while watched; same shape as `event.agent.output` without `lane_id`. |
| `event.orchestrator.status` | `{ running, agent?, model?, backend?, window?, autonomy?, session_id?, attention, headline? }` - broadcast when the orchestrator starts, stops, is reconciled to stopped after its window died, or its `attention` changes. |

Object ids travel as lowercase hex strings; timestamps as RFC3339 UTC.

### Usage ledger and recount

The ledger stores per-turn `usage_events`; it does not store pre-priced daily totals. `usage.summary`, `usage.timeline`,
`usage.sessions`, and `usage.findings` query a time window; `usage.export` writes CSV or JSON under the daemon data
directory. `usage.status` reports `sources`, `stale_sources`, `ingesting`, and `last_scan_at`, along with ledger totals.

A reader revision marks previously read sources stale. Ingest recounts at most 25 sources per pass, replacing the
successfully reread source's events instead of adding duplicates. Missing or unsupported old sources preserve existing
events and leave the recount queue. Unreadable sources preserve their events and offset, retiring after three failed
attempts at least a minute apart. `event.usage.changed` prompts clients to reload both totals and progress.
`usage.ingest_now` requests a local ingest pass and redigests stale session headlines. Account quota refresh
(`usage.refresh`) is a separate operation, described below.

### Usage model rates

`usage.models` takes no params and returns `ModelRateRow[]`: one row per model in `usage_events`, plus every configured
override, including unseen model ids or family prefixes. It is readable over the remote bridge. Each row contains:

- `model`: model id or family prefix.
- `input_per_mtok`, `output_per_mtok`, `cache_read_per_mtok`, `cache_write_per_mtok`: resolved USD rates
  per million tokens.
- `source`: `builtin`, `litellm`, `override`, or `unpriced`. Unmatched models have zero rates and are
  explicitly `unpriced`; known free-tier models are `builtin` at zero.
- `override`: the raw `PriceOverride` or `null`. Its four rate fields and `effective_from` are nullable;
  absent corrections are never filled with resolved values here.
- `last_seen`: latest `usage_events.at` timestamp, or `null` for an unseen override.
- `tokens_30d`: sum of input, output, cache-read, and cache-write tokens in the last 30 days. Thinking
  tokens already billed as output are not counted twice.

`usage.rates` remains the small provenance response (`RatesStatus`): source counts, refresh state, fetch timestamp, next
refresh timestamp, ETag, and last error. `usage.refresh_rates` returns the same shape after an immediate refresh and
remains local-only.

`config.get` includes `usage_enabled` and `usage_refresh_prices`. Local-only `config.set` accepts either toggle and
these atomic per-model patches:

```json
{"usage_price_override_upsert":{"model":"claude-sonnet-5","output_per_mtok":9}}
```

```json
{"usage_price_override_reset":"claude-sonnet-5"}
```

Upsert accepts `input_per_mtok`, `output_per_mtok`, `cache_read_per_mtok`, and `cache_write_per_mtok`. At least one
finite non-negative rate is required. Zero is a valid rate. Omitted fields preserve existing overrides, otherwise
inheriting the resolved snapshot or built-in value. The model must be non-empty with no surrounding whitespace. Reset
removes that model's entire override; resetting a missing key is a no-op. Both operations return the updated config
view, persist `[usage.price_overrides]`, and update the daemon's live config. The next usage query re-prices history
without a restart. Rate edits emit `event.usage.changed` as well as `event.config.changed` so open views reload their
costs.

### Manual usage refresh

`usage.refresh` (no params, local only) reads cached gates and immediately returns `{ refreshed: false, reason, detail,
snapshot, request_id? }`. The reason is `pending`, `probe_disabled`, `no_active_kind`, or `cooldown` (a manual round is
already queued/running). An unknown fleet cache accepts a pending request; a known cache with no supported active kind
skips it. Manual requests bypass the five-minute freshness cooldown and wake ledger ingest. No probe IO or completion
wait happens in the connection's serial RPC dispatcher.

Subscribe before requesting refresh. `event.usage.refreshed` carries `{ request_id, reason: "ok" | "probe_disabled" |
"no_active_kind" | "timeout" | "error", detail, snapshot }`. The watcher sends completion, or a `timeout` notification
after 15 seconds while it continues probing. That notification does not release the round's single-flight guard; final
completion can arrive later on the same ticket.

A hard ceiling of 75 seconds per installed account (at least one account) releases the guard even if the watcher stops.
Old timers cannot release a newer ticket.

`snapshot` matches `usage.get`. Only a matching ticket settles a client's wait, even if its event arrives before the RPC
response.

Desktop waits for the event locally, with a 20-second ceiling, then re-snapshots quota and today's cost and shows an
inline notice when appropriate. Late completion still refreshes the displayed numbers. Completion preserves
disabled/no-active gates and final timeouts instead of calling every non-success an error. Clients show the supplied
detail to distinguish a final timeout from the earlier still-probing notification.

A soft deadline notification means work is continuing, including later accounts in a round. Desktop renders that notice
as "Still probing, this can take a moment", including its own 20-second ceiling. Only `error` uses failure wording.
Fleet polling continues during the round, so accounts already probed can update before the final completion.
