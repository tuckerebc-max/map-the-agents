### The terminal-native coding agent that actually *lives* on your machine.

**One static binary. No Node. No Python. No Docker. No cloud account.**

Point it at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint and you have a coding partner that reads and edits your
code, runs your shell, verifies its own work, and remembers how *you* like things.

## Install

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talmetis-labs/aizen/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

```bash
# Linux / macOS
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talmetis-labs/aizen/main/install.sh | sh
```

Then open a new terminal:

```bash
aizen account login   # on an Aizen plan? sign in — no key to fetch, nothing to paste
aizen config          # or bring your own: base URL → API key → pick a model
aizen                 # land in the REPL and start typing
```

That's the whole setup. No env vars, no config file to hand-edit.

An Aizen plan is bought by signing in: the session opens the gateway on its own, and nothing but the
token is written to disk. On a machine that cannot open a browser — SSH, a container, CI — pair it
instead with `aizen login`, which approves a short code and comes back with a key.

<sub>Prefer to do it by hand? Grab a binary from the
[latest release](https://github.com/talmetis-labs/aizen/releases/latest) — or build it yourself with
`cargo install --git https://github.com/talmetis-labs/aizen`. Upgrade or roll back any time with
`aizen update`. The Windows `.exe` is unsigned, so SmartScreen will ask: *More info → Run anyway*.</sub>

## Why Aizen

|  | |
|---|---|
| **One file, no runtime** | 34 MB static binary, ~10 ms cold start. No Node, no Python, no 2 GB virtualenv. Runs on a 512 MB VPS, a scratch container, a CI runner, or a Pi. |
| **Bring your own model** | Any OpenAI-style `/chat/completions` endpoint — OpenAI, OpenRouter, a local llama.cpp/vLLM, an Anthropic gateway. Never locked to one lab. |
| **It finishes the job** | Reads, edits, runs your shell — then **verifies before claiming done**: it runs your typecheck and tests, and fixes what it broke. |
| **It remembers you** | An offline, BM25-ranked memory brain that learns from reuse — plus a persona, a durable SOUL identity, and skills it writes for itself after real work. |
| **It runs where you aren't** | `aizen serve` drives the agent from Telegram or Discord and asks your phone to approve risky edits. Host it on systemd, Docker, or Kubernetes — behind NAT, no inbound port. |
| **Safe by construction** | An OS sandbox under the approval layer: children never inherit your API keys, network is deny-by-default, and the filesystem policy is kernel-enforced on Linux (Landlock+seccomp) and macOS (Seatbelt) — Windows gets Job-Object containment and honest `partial` reporting, not pretend enforcement. A hard command floor refuses catastrophic commands **even under auto-approve**. `aizen sandbox status` shows exactly what *your* machine enforces — see [docs/SANDBOX.md](docs/SANDBOX.md). |

## What it can do

```
  aizen agent "fix the failing parse test"

  ⚙ search_files  "fn parse_config"        3 hits
  ⚙ file_read     src/config.rs            142 lines
  ⚙ file_edit     src/config.rs            3 edits
  ⚙ shell_run     cargo test               ✓ 0 failed · 1.18s
                                           verify gate passed
```

| **Unified REPL** | One chat + agent loop, no mode switch. Live HUD: model · tokens · turn · `% context`. Markdown, tables, diagrams, image input. |
| **Agent loop** | Parallel reads, approval-gated writes, LSP-powered symbolic edits, sub-agent dispatch, and a verify gate that must pass before "done". |
| **Multi-agent** | The Pantheon: seven capability-scoped sub-agents (`argus` finds · `metis` plans · `daedalus` builds · `nemesis` reviews · `themis` tests · `clio` researches · `mnemosyne` recalls); `aizen workflow` fans them out and synthesises one answer. |
| **Web + browser** | Search, fetch, and a katana-style crawler — all SSRF-guarded. Opt-in CDP tools drive a real Chrome. |
| **Extensible** | MCP servers (stdio/HTTP, OAuth 2.1), markdown slash-command macros, outbound notify channels. |
| **Recoverable** | Git-backed checkpoints — `/timemachine` rewinds a bad turn. |
