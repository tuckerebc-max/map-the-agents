## Git Push Issues Resolution

This document outlines the issues encountered when pushing to GitHub and how they were resolved.

### Issues Identified

1. **HTTPS Authentication Stuck**

   - **Problem**: `git push -u origin main` was getting stuck when using HTTPS URL (`https://github.com/SFARPak/AliFullStack.git`)
   - **Root Cause**: HTTPS requires authentication via personal access token, which may not be configured or the terminal was waiting for input
   - **Solution**: Switched to SSH authentication using `git@github.com:SFARPak/AliFullStack.git`

2. **Repository Corruption**

   - **Problem**: Push failed with error "fatal: did not receive expected object de2cc2b48f2c8bfa401608c63b5fa325bd7dc0dc"
   - **Root Cause**: Local Git repository had corrupted pack files, likely due to large files or interrupted operations
   - **Solution**: Created a fresh clone without corrupted objects

3. **Large Files Exceeding GitHub Limits**

   - **Problem**: GitHub rejected push with "GH001: Large files detected" for files over 100 MB
   - **Affected Files**:
     - `node_modules/@next/swc-darwin-x64/next-swc.darwin-x64.node` (119.25 MB)
     - `node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app/Contents/Frameworks/Electron Framework.framework/Electron Framework` (173.51 MB)
     - `Roo-Code/.git_disabled/objects/pack/pack-cad8add59b006bb56e41af36da143abccc6fb1bd.pack` (161.24 MB)
   - **Solution**: Excluded `node_modules` and `Roo-Code` directories from the repository (properly handled by `.gitignore`)

4. **Git LFS Integration Issues**
   - **Problem**: Git LFS objects were being uploaded but pack corruption affected the process
   - **Solution**: Resolved by cleaning the repository and ensuring LFS objects are properly tracked

### Resolution Steps Taken

1. **Switched to SSH Authentication**

   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:SFARPak/AliFullStack.git
   ```

2. **Created Clean Repository Copy**

   - Cloned the original repository to avoid corruption
   - Excluded problematic directories (`node_modules`, `Roo-Code`, `.git`)

3. **Removed Large Files**

   - Ensured `node_modules/` is in `.gitignore`
   - Excluded `Roo-Code/` submodule which contained large Git objects

4. **Created New GitHub Repository**
   - New repository: `https://github.com/SFARPak/AliFullStackV0.git`
   - Pushed clean code successfully

### Prevention Measures

1. **Use SSH for GitHub Authentication**: Avoids token management issues
2. **Proper .gitignore**: Ensure large directories like `node_modules` are ignored
3. **Regular Repository Maintenance**: Use `git gc` and `git fsck` to check for corruption
4. **Git LFS for Large Files**: Use Git LFS for files >100 MB if needed in the future

### Commands Used for Resolution

```bash
# Switch to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:SFARPak/AliFullStack.git

# Create clean copy excluding large files
rsync -av --exclude='node_modules' --exclude='.git' --exclude='Roo-Code' /source/ /clean-repo/

# Initialize new repo and push
cd /clean-repo
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:SFARPak/AliFullStackV0.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit without large files"
git push -u origin main
```

### Status

✅ **RESOLVED**: Code successfully pushed to new GitHub repository
✅ **PREVENTION**: Documented best practices for future development
