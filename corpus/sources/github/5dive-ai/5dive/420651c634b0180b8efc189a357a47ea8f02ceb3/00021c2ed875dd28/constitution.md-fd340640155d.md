# Company constitution (`constitution.yaml`)

5dive can load governance policy from `${STATE_DIR}/constitution.yaml` (normally
`/var/lib/5dive/constitution.yaml`). Set `FIVEDIVE_CONSTITUTION_FILE` to exercise a
candidate in an isolated environment. If the file is absent or malformed, the
loader atomically uses the shipped pre-constitution defaults; it never applies a
partial document.

The whole file is parsed as YAML. There is no Markdown body and no `---`
frontmatter fence: human rationale lives in `#` comments, which are covered by
the sealed digest but never parsed as policy.

```yaml

The v0 parser accepts two-space mappings, scalar values, inline arrays, and block
sequences of plain scalars (`  - name` on its own line). `authority.gate_clear_leads`
must use the **block** form and is refused inline when it names anyone: bash is what
enforces that key, its node-free reader accepts only the block shape, and a document
that lists holders inline would seal names the enforcer then denies.
`hard_gates` values are case-insensitive POSIX ERE patterns. Supplying the
`hard_gates` map replaces the shipped class map, so an organization can add or
remove a class without patching the CLI. Bash compile-probes the combined
pattern before using it; if Bash rejects it, the entire loaded map is discarded
and task gate tiering warns and falls back to the shipped tier-2 floor.

Live consumers:

- Council tally reads the configured bench pointer, per-class thresholds, and
  quorum.
- Founder-veto offers/windows read `veto` (the environment remains the fallback
  only when no constitution exists).
- Task gate tiering compiles `hard_gates` into the tier-2 human-only floor.
- `ship` and `comms` are parsed and digest-coverable soft-policy data; they are
  not execution rules in v0.

CNCL-14 is the loader/consumer layer. Genesis digest sealing, drift verification,
and the constitutional-motion-only amendment path are CNCL-15; until that lands,
operators should treat direct edits as setup/testing, not a ratified amendment.
