# Contributing to 5dive

Thanks for the interest. This is a solo-maintained project — reviews can be
slow, and not every idea will land. If you're planning more than a small
fix, open an issue first so we can sanity-check fit before you sink time
into it.

## Scope

5dive's core mission is **spawning and managing AI coding agents on a
host**. Features that directly serve that (new agent types, better
isolation, better visibility into running agents, smoother install/upgrade)
are in scope. Features that drift into adjacent territory — full IdP,
package registries, monitoring stacks, GUI installers — usually aren't,
and we'll point at upstream tools instead. If you're not sure, ask in an
issue before building. [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) shows where the project is
headed — items there are safe bets for contributions.

## Dev setup

Requirements:

- Linux host (Ubuntu/Debian-flavoured tested; other distros likely work
  but the installer assumes apt).
- `bash` 4.x+, `git`, `jq`, `sqlite3` (the unit tests need the last two).
- Optional: `bun` (only if you're touching channel/plugin wiring), and a
  throwaway VM if you're touching the install path — see Testing below.

Clone and build the CLI bundle:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/5dive-ai/5dive.git
cd 5dive
./build.sh        # concatenates src/ into the single-file `5dive` bundle
bash -n 5dive     # syntax-check the bundle
```

## Project layout

```
src/              # CLI source — split for readability
  header.sh       # set -euo pipefail, globals, declare -A maps (must be first)
  lib/*.sh        # error_codes, output, validation, state/audit/registry, agent_setup
  cmd_*.sh        # one file per top-level subcommand
  main.sh         # usage(), main(), EXIT trap (must be last)
5dive             # built bundle — committed, kept in sync with src/ by CI
tests/            # unit harnesses — run by the unit-tests CI job (see Testing)
install.sh        # one-liner installer fetched by curl
systemd/          # unit files installed for agents
hooks/            # shell hooks the CLI drops into the user's $HOME
docker/           # demo container for tire-kickers
skills/           # agent skills installed alongside the CLI
docs/             # design notes and the quickstart assets
.github/workflows # CI
```

A few files sit loose at the repo root (`5dive-agent-start`, the
`5dive-refresh-*.sh` helpers, `*-CLAUDE.md` templates, `cos-*.ts`) because
`install.sh` and the CLI fetch them by raw URL at install/update time —
they're install-time assets, not leftovers. Don't move them without
updating every fetch path.

See the README's **Contributing** section for the rationale behind the
single-file bundle and `./build.sh`.

## The bundle rule (please read)

`./build.sh` concatenates `src/` into the committed `5dive` bundle. **Both
files are tracked** — CI's `bundle-drift` job runs `./build.sh && git diff
--exit-code 5dive` and fails any PR where they disagree. Two rules:

- Edit `src/`, never the bundle. The bundle is generated.
- After editing `src/`, run `./build.sh` and commit the regenerated `5dive`
  in the same PR.

If `bundle-drift` fails, you forgot the rebuild. Run `./build.sh`, commit,
push again.

## Testing

Lightweight checks (always run before opening a PR):

```bash
./build.sh        # rebuilds the bundle
bash -n 5dive     # bundle syntax check
for t in tests/*.sh; do bash "$t" || echo "FAILED: $t"; done   # unit harnesses
```

The `tests/` harnesses need no root and no network: each one sources
`src/` directly into a throwaway state dir, so the live agent registry and
task DB are never touched. CI (`unit-tests`) runs all of them on every PR —
if you add or change behavior in a covered area (task gates, loops,
secret drop, supervisor), extend the matching harness in the same PR. New
harnesses that follow the same pattern are very welcome; the biggest
uncovered surfaces are the task core verbs and the agent lifecycle.

**If you add a harness, it must name the tree it grades.** Every harness reads
`src/` from the working tree by relative path, so a green log is a claim about
whatever is on disk, not about a commit: a run against a stale checkout and a
run against `origin/main` produce byte-identical output. Paste this immediately
after `set -uo pipefail` in your new file (copy it verbatim from any existing
harness, e.g. `tests/usage_coverage_unit.sh`):

```bash
# DIVE-2211: name the tree this harness grades (tests/lib/grading_tree.sh).
. "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib/grading_tree.sh" \
  || printf 'grading tree: UNRESOLVED (tests/lib/grading_tree.sh not reachable; no tree named)\n' >&2
```

Keep the **absence** of `2>/dev/null` on that line, and keep the comment block
that explains why: the helper writes its one line to stderr by design, so
redirecting the source's stderr to hide bash's "No such file" also swallows the
payload, silently, across the whole corpus.

`tests/names_the_tree_contract_unit.sh` enforces this over `tests/*.sh` and
prints the exact block to paste when it fails. Note that it is a **merge-order
hazard**: it enumerates the corpus rather than a fixed list, so two PRs that are
each green in isolation can red on merge, and whoever merges second inherits the
failure. If CI reds on a harness you did not touch, rebase on `main` and add the
block to the new file; that is the whole fix.

Heavyweight smoke test: if you touched `install.sh`, `src/cmd_agent.sh`,
`src/lib/agent_setup.sh`, or anything else on the agent-create path, a
maintainer will run a full-VM smoke (provisions a real cloud box, runs the
agent matrix, purges) before merging. Flag the affected path in the PR
description so it doesn't get missed.

If you have a throwaway VM of your own, the manual equivalent is: run
`install.sh` against a fresh box, then `5dive agent create test --type=claude`
and `5dive doctor`. Anything red there is what the smoke test would have
caught.

## Pull requests

- One concern per PR. Reviewers spend more time on a 200-line PR with mixed
  concerns than on two 100-line PRs.
- **Start the PR title with a conventional type — it is checked, and it picks
  the next version number.** main takes squash merges, so the PR title becomes
  the commit subject, and `release-cut` reads those subjects to decide the
  level of the next release:

  | title starts with | the next release is |
  | --- | --- |
  | `feat:` / `feat(scope):` | a **minor** (`0.x`) |
  | any type with `!:`, or a `BREAKING CHANGE` trailer | a **major** |
  | `fix` `test` `chore` `docs` `refactor` `ci` `perf` | a **patch** (`0.x.x`) |

  So `feat` is a release decision rather than a label — nobody passes a version
  level by hand any more (DIVE-4086). Do NOT copy the older prefixes still
  visible in `git log` (`cli:`, `ui:`, `install:`, `build:`, or a bare
  `DIVE-1234:`): 30 of the 60 merges before this rule landed carry no type at
  all, which is exactly why the check exists. Follow the table, not the log.
- After the title, a one-line summary and then a paragraph on the *why* if it
  isn't obvious.
- No `--no-verify` on commits — CI runs the same checks anyway, you'll
  just learn about the failure later.
- Never bump the version — not in your PR, and not on `main` either. Since
  DIVE-2247 `FIVE_VERSION` is assigned at **tag time**, by `release-cut.yml`,
  onto the release commit it builds. `main` carries the sentinel
  `0.0.0-dev` and no branch ever carries a real version. This replaced
  assignment-at-merge, which needed a bot push to protected `main` that
  branch protection rejects — so for three days every version was assigned by
  hand. If you find yourself editing `FIVE_VERSION`, something is wrong;
  nothing outside `release-cut.yml` should write it.
- You also don't commit the bundle. `5dive` and `5dive.sha256` are generated
  at tag time (DIVE-2091) and are not tracked on `main`; `bundle-drift` CI
  checks that `build.sh` is reproducible from `src/`, not that a committed
  bundle matches.
- Changelog entry: editing the top of `CHANGELOG.md` directly still works, but
  every PR that does it collides with every other open PR touching the same
  spot (DIVE-2582). Prefer adding `changelog.d/<ident>.md` instead — see
  `changelog.d/README.md` — it never conflicts, and folds into `CHANGELOG.md`
  automatically at the next release cut.
