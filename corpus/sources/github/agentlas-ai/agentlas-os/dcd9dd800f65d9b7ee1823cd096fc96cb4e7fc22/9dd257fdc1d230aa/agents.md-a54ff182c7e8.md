# Agentlas Core Engine Meta-Agent Team

<!-- AGENTLAS-INSTALL-ENTRY -->
> **Asked to install this repo, not to work on it?** This file is the
> contributor constitution and will not help you. Read the install block at the
> top of [README.md](README.md): it points at
> `scripts/install-all-runtimes.sh`, which writes only under `~/.agentlas`,
> `~/.local/bin`, and this host's own plugin/command-adapter directories.


## Repository Constitution: Local Main Only

This repository uses one canonical development line: the local `main` branch
in the canonical Agentlas OS checkout.

- Make every source change and commit directly on local `main`.
- Do not create feature, release, backup, agent-named, or temporary branches.
- Do not create Git worktrees. Use an external recovery directory or a verified
  Git bundle when a safety snapshot is required.
- Before editing, confirm the canonical checkout is on `main`, inspect status,
  fetch remote refs, and inspect `main...origin/main`. A GUI "Pull origin"
  button is not permission to pull or merge blindly.
- If local `main` is dirty, preserve it with a reviewed checkpoint commit before
  reconciling remote changes on that same branch.
- Push only `main` and intentional release tags. Do not publish side branches.

## Public Release Allowlist (Hard Rule)

Before any commit, push, tag, release, or upload to a public GitHub repository,
construct and review an explicit allowlist. Public source and release artifacts
may contain only files required for an end user to install and run the product,
plus public-facing `README`, `LICENSE`, and `CHANGELOG` material.

Never publish internal design or research documents, plans, benchmarks,
benchmark prompts or results, tests, fixtures, test data, scores, logs,
screenshots, signing material, certificates, credentials, environment files,
operator notes, private paths, local memory, or recovery artifacts. Run tests
and benchmarks only in local/private temporary storage or private CI; publish
neither their inputs nor their artifacts. Existing unrelated local work must
remain unstaged.

For a public release, do not use a blanket `git add -A`. Stage the allowlist
explicitly, inspect `git diff --cached --name-only` and the staged archive
manifest, scan the staged content for secrets/private paths, and stop the
release if any excluded class appears. A passing test does not authorize
publishing the test.

This repository is a portable four-agent meta-agent team. Use it to create or
package Agentlas-compatible single agents and multi-agent teams for Codex,
Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Cursor, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes
Agent, Ollama-served local models (Gemma, DeepSeek — see
`docs/local-models.md`), and `AGENTS.md`-compatible runtimes.

Runtime-specific folders are adapters. They must mirror the canonical core, not
become separate sources of truth.

Agent Ontology (AO), Agent Workforce Ontology, the local semantic ontology,
Context Map, and Career Graph are independent active systems. Super Ontology is
retired and must not be generated, loaded, validated, packaged, or presented as
a source of truth. Its retained documentation is an archived design record only.

## Third-Party Plugin Boundary

Third-party services and optional provider integrations belong in independently
installable Agentlas plugins, not in Agentlas Core. This includes search APIs,
model providers, hosted browsers, data sources, SaaS connectors, payment
providers, and vendor-specific MCP servers.

Reject a provider contribution when it requires provider-specific changes to
Core registries, CLI provider maps, default or full loadouts, credential maps,
doctor or profile logic, ranking policy, network allowlists, or generated
runtime mirrors. An existing built-in integration is legacy precedent, not
permission to duplicate that wiring for another provider.

An acceptable third-party plugin must be independently installable,
upgradeable, disableable, and removable; activate only by explicit user choice;
declare capabilities, authentication, network hosts, operations, and privacy
effects without embedding credential values; and fail safely when unavailable.
Installing or removing it must not require a Core patch.

Core changes are considered only for a provider-neutral, versioned extension
contract that serves multiple independent plugins or enforces a Core invariant.
Propose that contract separately from any vendor implementation. Do not use a
vendor PR to introduce both the extension point and its first provider. Follow
`PLUGIN_CONTRIBUTIONS.md` for the submission and review checklist.

## Generated Instruction Language

All generated or repaired agent instruction files must be written in English.
This includes `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `agent.md`, role cards,
skills, workflow/command adapters, runtime prompts, handoff contracts, return
contracts, and package docs that are read as operating instructions.

Korean and other languages are allowed only for user-facing public copy,
localized marketplace fields, trigger examples, and sample user inputs. If the
source material or the user's request is written in Korean, translate the agent
behavior into English before writing runtime instructions.

## Source Code & Commit Language

This is a public, open-source repository. Code comments and commit messages
must be written in English going forward, regardless of the language the
requesting session or the user's instructions were written in. This applies to
new commits only — do not rewrite existing git history to relabel past commit
messages.

Exempt from this rule (leave as-is, do not force-translate): localized
marketplace/product copy, Korean sample inputs used as routing or i18n test
fixtures (e.g. `"사업계획서 만들어줘"` as a query example), and any string that is
itself the user-facing product output rather than an explanation of the code.
When translating an explanatory comment, preserve its meaning and any
file:line/command/evidence citations exactly — do not summarize away the
specifics that made the comment worth writing.

## Operating Loop

Before applying the package-building loop below, preserve the product runtime
authority model:

- Agentlas One is the sole controller of every One session. Explicit `@agent`
  targets are turn-scoped sub-agents and never change session ownership.
- Desktop and Mobile Work create only project-bound tasks. The first agent in
  the project's ordered agent pool is the controller; remaining members are
  eligible task-scoped workers selected through validated WorkOrders.
- Plan, Goal, Network, Live, permission, and explicit agent targets are optional
  overrides. Omission means the controller decides, not that the capability is
  disabled.
- Do not recreate global chat, Agent Group, generated group orchestrator,
  persistent hired-agent, or session agent-switch contracts in adapters,
  templates, examples, or generated packages.
- Do not make semantic decisions with regex gates, keyword lists, glossaries,
  deterministic lexical scores, or default-agent substitution. Leave a decision
  unavailable when the connected model cannot make a valid judgment.
- Protocols may define state, evidence, capability, CTA slots, and question
  layouts. One or the project controller supplies user-facing recovery content
  from current context; do not expose internal codes or operator vocabulary.

1. Run the public mode classifier (`skills/mode-classification/SKILL.md`) and
   classify the request by independent ownership boundaries, not keywords. If
   existing material is being converted, repaired, cleaned, imported, or
   released, route to packager first. Otherwise count roles that independently
   own memory/context, tools/permissions, and success criteria; one boundary is
   single-agent, two or more plus routing/synthesis/produces-consumes handoff is
   team-builder. If the boundary is unclear, clarify before generation instead
   of guessing. Classify the request as one of:
   - create one single agent;
   - create a multi-agent team;
   - package or repair an existing local/external agent or team;
   - compile an explicitly exported session into a reviewed agent or team.
2. If required details would change the package, run the clarify loop
   (`skills/clarify-question-loop/SKILL.md`) before generating files.
3. Route to exactly one core team member:
   - `10-single-agent-builder`;
   - `20-multi-agent-team-builder`;
   - `30-agentlas-packager`;
   - `40-session-agent-builder` for an explicitly exported session source.
4. Run the Builder Interview and Research Gate
   (`contracts/builder-interview-research-gate.md`) before writing substantial
   generated package files. Ask an 8-12 question first batch when the request is
   vague, continue follow-ups until the functional brief is clear, research
   official sources, similar agent repositories or comparables,
   academic/professional theory, and plugin documentation, then select
   tools/plugins only after checking permissions, secrets, alternatives, and
   smoke-test paths. If single-agent vs team shape is unclear, the first batch
   must ask in plain language: "이 일을 한 명의 전문가가 처음부터 끝까지 맡으면
   되나요, 아니면 조사/분석/검토처럼 여러 전문가가 나눠 맡고 마지막에
   합쳐야 하나요?" Do not expose internal labels like ownership boundary,
   memory/context, synthesis, or produces/consumes to non-technical users.
5. Inspect current files before making claims. Prefer real files over remembered
   assumptions.
6. Emit or repair the smallest useful Agentlas package.
7. Add the required architecture contracts for the selected mode.
8. Add `docs/builder-interview.md`, `docs/research-sources.md`,
   `docs/tool-selection.md`, `docs/domain-expert-synthesis.md`,
   `docs/prompt-performance-contract.md`, and
   `.agentlas/capability-eval-plan.json` unless the task is explicitly a
   minimal private scaffold or trivial adapter repair.
9. Before writing generated agent instructions, enforce the Generated
   Instruction Language policy: write runtime instructions in English, even
   when the source brief is Korean.
10. Add thin adapters for Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and
   optional Cursor.
11. Assign one canonical global command during creation, write
   `.agentlas/global-commands.json`, add runtime command files or aliases, and
   keep team worker roles routed through the orchestrator/HQ command unless the
   user explicitly asks for direct worker commands.
12. Add `.agentlas` seed files when the generated or packaged output needs local
   continuity; local runtimes may auto-activate them using
   `skills/agentlas-auto-activation/SKILL.md`.
13. Add or repair `agentlas.json` so Agentlas Cloud can compile a runtime
    bundle, gate lazy file reads, and separate private sync from public clean
    copies. Seed `.agentlas/mcp-policy.json` only when missing: resolve the
    system-global registry first, ask once for the selected set, load selected
    tool schemas and triggered skills only, and isolate each MCP failure.
14. Add skill lifecycle metadata using
   `skills/skill-lifecycle-promotion/SKILL.md` when the package contains
   reusable skills.
15. For generated or repaired packages, run
    `scripts/verify-team-package.sh <generated-package-root>` before the final
    report. If it fails, do not report `completed`; fix the shape by collapsing
    to a valid single-agent package or adding orchestrator/HQ plus company
    topology.
16. Also run `scripts/verify-generated-package.sh <generated-package-root>`.
    This is the gate that checks the package against `package-contract.json` —
    every required artifact present, parseable, schema-valid, and with no
    `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` left unfilled. It is mandatory for the same reason the
    contract exists at all: while nothing compared a package to that list, the
    live catalogue drifted to `capability-eval-plan.json` on 4% of published
    releases and `mcp-policy.json` on 50%, both marked required since the day the
    contract was written, and 142 of 144 forge packages failed the benchmark
    artifact on its PATH alone while the file sat on disk. Do not report
    `completed` on a FAIL; the named artifact is missing or malformed, and a
    package that ships without it cannot be routed to.
17. Verify with `scripts/verify-package.sh`.
18. For ontology runtime changes, also verify with
    `scripts/verify-ontology-runtime.sh`.
18. For long-running or multi-file execution work, apply
    `docs/robustness-protocol.md`: scope lock, plan lock, evidence loop,
    review gate, and final gate before claiming completion.

## Hephaestus Network Commands

Agentlas-native surfaces are commandless: Agentlas Terminal and the Agentlas
app should accept plain language and dispatch through native Agentlas/
Hephaestus tools without requiring a `/hep-*` command. External LLM hosts
registered through MCP, plugins, prompts, or command files expose the core
commands `/hep-build`, `/hep-network`, `/hep-local`, `/hep-cloud`, `/hep-hub`,
`/hep-search`, `/hep-browser`, `/hep-call`, `/hep-upload`, `/hep-storm`, and
`/hep-graph`. Current Codex exposes build, Network, Cloud, upload, Stormbreaker,
and Graph as `$hephaestus-*` plugin skills; the remaining typed MCP surfaces are
requested in plain language. Custom `/prompts:hep-*` commands are legacy only.
Antigravity is an independent runtime target, not a Gemini CLI mode, and is the
default Gemini-family target where the operator did not explicitly request
Gemini CLI.

`/hep-build <request>` is the creation, repair, memory, playbook, and
diagnostics surface. `/hep-network <request>` (alias
`@Hephaestus <request>`, terminal `hep-network "<request>"`) is the
Agent Workforce Ontology staffing surface across Local, Cloud, and Hub.
`/hep-local`, `/hep-cloud`, and `/hep-hub` use exactly one source each and
never widen scope. The active host LLM creates a redacted work order, calls
the local `hephaestus-network` MCP tool `workforce.search_candidates` with
`sourceScope`, preserves its source receipts and selection session, chooses
the exact roster, then calls `workforce.validate_selection` with only the exact
WorkOrder and host-authored Selection. Core resolves the full pinned federation
result by `selectionSessionId`; the default projected menu must not be echoed as
`federationResult`. It passes the accepted Selection and `federatedSelection`
plus mandatory `projectDir` to `workforce.prepare_execution`. It then runs distinct
worker/synthesis/verifier invocations. Do not expose a second remote `agentlas`
MCP on hosts that can run local Core: Core reaches Cloud and Hub through its
internal upstream client, and duplicate `workforce.*` tools would bypass the
federation and privacy boundary. Deterministic code enforces hard constraints
but never picks the final team. The standalone shell
aliases can only report `host_llm_required`; the old card router is an explicit
`HEPHAESTUS_LEGACY_ROUTER=1` compatibility/debug surface.
The legacy `hephaestus_route` and `hephaestus_cloud_search` MCP tools have the
same explicit opt-in gate and are never substitutes for typed staffing.
`/hep-search <request>` compares Cloud and Hub
candidates without invoking. `/hep-call <slugs> <context>` prepares explicitly
named agents. `/hep-upload <agent-folder>` is the upload gate: before any
package, publish, register, add-source, reindex, or upload API call, ask whether
the destination is private Agentlas Cloud or public Agentlas Hub.

Workforce candidate retrieval uses roles, skills, knowledge, MCP/tool
capabilities, artifact contracts, runtimes, languages, authority, entity kind,
and evidence levels. It never uses installs, ratings, revenue, invocation
history, or local callability as semantic fit. Selection and preparation pin
immutable release, package hash, and content digest; unavailable posts remain
explicit and substitution requires a new host-LLM decision. Never send raw
prompts or local memory to Hub. A selection or prepared BYOM bundle is not an
execution receipt: completion requires planner parse success without fallback,
distinct child invocations, artifact handoffs, synthesis, and an independent
passing verifier. Validate the host-produced receipt locally with
`workforce.validate_execution_receipt`; that read-only validator neither runs
workers nor creates execution evidence. Generated and packaged repos must include
`.agentlas/routing-card.json` (see `schemas/routing-card.schema.json`); cards
compile into immutable workforce profiles and lifecycle events.

`hep-global install` is a shell utility, not a task command: it installs a
managed Hephaestus Global Router marker block into `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` and
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, and `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` for Antigravity/Gemini. That
block makes ordinary host prompts use Network federation unless an exact
Local, Cloud, or Hub scope was requested. Exact-scope commands never silently
widen when a source is unavailable, a workforce MCP call is rejected, or no
qualified slot coverage exists. If a source is blocked by credits,
entitlement, availability, or fit, the host reports that exact boundary.
Status lines must
name final workers, not
router commands: `사용 에이전트:`/`Agents used:` for agents and
`사용 스킬:`/`Skills used:` only for final skill fallbacks.
`hep-global status` reports the managed block state; `hep-global remove`
removes only the marker block and leaves the user's surrounding prompt file
intact.

Hephaestus Network chooses the agent, team, plugin, or Hub bundle. Hephaestus
Stormbreaker governs execution after that route is selected: it requires scope
locking, issue-contract extraction, failure-memory checks, verifier-first
planning, a parallel session fabric for pipeline work, bounded evidence loops,
review gates, outcome ledgers, and a final completion gate for substantial
work. Pipeline success is blocked until every required execution packet is
passing or the run is explicitly reported as blocked.

## Team Roles

- `10-single-agent-builder`: one installable self-evolving worker package.
- `20-multi-agent-team-builder`: multi-role team package with orchestrator/HQ,
  PM Soul, Memory Curator, Policy Gate, eval, QA, handoffs, memory, and runtime
  adapters.
- `30-agentlas-packager`: package or repair existing local/external agents and
  teams into Agentlas architecture for local use, Agentlas import, Codex plugin
  use, Claude adapter use, or open-source release.
- `40-session-agent-builder`: convert explicitly exported host sessions into a
  reviewed reusable agent or team candidate, with no raw transcript carryover.

PM Soul, Memory Curator, runtime adapters, sitemap/task-bias, policy, eval, and
verification are generated architecture components. They are not extra members
of this meta-agent team.

## Output Contract

When asked to create, repair, or package an agent repo, return:

- `status`: completed, blocked, or needs_clarification.
- `evidence`: files inspected, commands run, and verification result.
- `output`: generated path, changed files, or exact design.
- `global_commands`: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, generic
  AGENTS.md, and terminal commands from `.agentlas/global-commands.json`.
- `interview_research`: interview status, unresolved assumptions, similar
  agent/repository research, academic or professional theory basis,
  selected/rejected tools or plugins, domain-expert synthesis,
  prompt-performance contract, and capability-eval plan.
- `blockers`: only blockers that require the user or external state.

Generated or packaged repos must include the relevant subset of:

- visible `agents/` and `skills/` folders;
- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`;
- `.agentlas/mode-map.json`;
- `.agentlas/agent-card.json`;
- `.agentlas/company-blueprint.json`;
- `.agentlas/global-commands.json`;
- `agentlas.json`;
- `docs/builder-interview.md`;
- `docs/research-sources.md`;
- `docs/tool-selection.md`;
- `docs/domain-expert-synthesis.md`;
- `docs/prompt-performance-contract.md`;
- `.agentlas/capability-eval-plan.json`;
- `.agentlas/memory-map.json`;
- `.agentlas/memory-tickets.jsonl`;
- `.agentlas/vault-references.json`;
- `.agentlas/local-credentials.map.json` plus `.env.example`, `signing/README.md`,
  and `credentials/README.md` when local credentials are required;
- `.agentlas/mcp-policy.json` with catalog-id-only requirements, value-free
  credential metadata, and no server command, args, endpoint, or key value;
- `.agentlas/skill-registry.json`;
- `.agentlas/skill-trials.jsonl`;
- `.agentlas/curator-decisions.jsonl`;
- runtime adapters and smoke-test docs;
- global command adapter files such as `.claude/commands/<slug>.md`,
  `codex/plugins/<package-id>/commands/<slug>.md`, and
  `gemini/extension/commands/<slug>.toml` with optional
  `.gemini/commands/<slug>.toml` fallback;
- production ontology runtime code, CLI, tests, and sample corpus when the
  package needs local-first knowledge storage, search, GraphRAG, Memory Curator
  bridge tickets, or Agent Working Memory;
- install or verification scripts;
- public-safety notes if the output is meant for GitHub.

Cloud-ready packages must pass the local setup wizard contract: `agentlas.json`
exists, the Hephaestus security scan is `PASS` or reviewable `WARN`, the
runtime bundle compiles from manifest allowlists, and denied paths never expose
secret-like values.

## Mode Rules

`single-agent-creator` produces one installable worker package. It can include
multiple skills, setup guides, memory architecture, research refresh, and
self-evolution proposals, but it must not inflate the request into a company,
HQ roster, or swarm. It must expose one global command for the worker and report
that command to the user after creation. It must not emit multiple loose worker
`agent.md` files; that is a team shape and requires HQ/topology.

`team-builder` produces a multi-role team package. It must include a root
orchestrator/HQ, PM Soul or project owner, Memory Curator, Policy Gate, worker
roles, eval judge, QA/evidence gate, handoff rules, runtime adapters, memory
architecture, and release checks. It must expose the orchestrator/HQ global
command as the public entry point; worker roles stay behind HQ routing unless
direct worker commands were explicitly requested. Team packages must pass
`scripts/verify-team-package.sh <package-root>` before completion.

`agentlas-packager` repairs or converts an existing agent/team into the Agentlas
shape. It adds canonical core files, `.agentlas` contracts, runtime adapters,
schemas, manifest, install scripts, global command registry, verification, and
public/private cleanup.

`session-agent-builder` accepts only explicitly named JSON/JSONL session
exports. It normalizes and redacts them into a reviewed Work Brief and
declarative session IR, then requires an explicit `single` or `team` choice and
owner approval before joining the normal package flow. It never captures a
recent session implicitly, carries raw transcript or hidden prompt content,
widens permissions, activates MCP, promotes a Skill, uploads, or publishes.

## Memory Preflight

Before substantial work:

1. Read `.agentlas/memory-map.json` if present.
2. Load only task-relevant memory.
3. Label remembered facts as `verified`, `memory_derived`, `inferred`, or
   `stale_check_needed`.
4. Re-check drift-prone facts against current files or sources.

Workers may emit `## Memory Events`. The runtime or orchestrator wraps those
events into Memory Tickets before durable curation.

Skills may also emit `## Skill Trial Events`. Those events are lifecycle
evidence for candidate/trial/first-class review and must not be mixed with
Memory Events. Generated packages keep all skills at `candidate` tier until a
local Curator approves promotion.

## Safety Rules

- Never store secrets, API keys, tokens, key material, credential file contents,
  raw logs, or full transcripts in generated repos or memory.
- Never copy a base agent prompt, skill, package file, raw prompt, customer
  record, or credential into an Experience Pack. Variant bindings use exact
  release references only, and official success accepts verified replay-safe
  RunReceipts only.
- Real credential values may be saved only in local gitignored project stores
  (`.env`, `.env.local`, `signing/`, `credentials/`) or a local keychain/vault.
  Generated public packages may include only placeholders, guide files, and a
  value-free `.agentlas/local-credentials.map.json`.
- Generated project memory must keep a `Local Credential Index (read first)`
  section near the top. For deploy, release, store, billing, auth, API, or
  cloud work, check that section and `.agentlas/local-credentials.map.json`
  before reporting missing credentials.
- Do not copy private local research folders into public output.
- Do not call runtime adapters canonical.
- Ask for explicit approval before destructive file actions, production deploys,
  paid API spend, permission widening, or public publishing.
- Public packages must pass `scripts/verify-package.sh` and
  `scripts/public_safety_check.sh` before release.
