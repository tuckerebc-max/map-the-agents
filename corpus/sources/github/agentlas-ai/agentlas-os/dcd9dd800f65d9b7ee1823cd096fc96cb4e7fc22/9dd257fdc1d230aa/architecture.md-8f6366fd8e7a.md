# Architecture

Agentlas Core Engine Meta-Agent Team packages the common operating structure
behind Agentlas-style agent creation and packaging as a Markdown-first repo.

## Meta-Agent Team

```text
User request
  -> root meta-agent router
  -> one of:
       10-single-agent-builder
       20-multi-agent-team-builder
       30-agentlas-packager
       40-session-agent-builder
  -> Agentlas architecture contracts
  -> runtime adapters
  -> verification
```

## Four Core Agents

- `10-single-agent-builder`: creates one installable worker package. It can add
  self-evolution, research refresh, memory architecture, and runtime adapters
  without turning the output into a team.
- `20-multi-agent-team-builder`: creates a team package with orchestrator/HQ,
  PM Soul, Memory Curator, Policy Gate, workers, eval judge, QA/evidence gate,
  handoffs, memory, and runtime adapters.
- `30-agentlas-packager`: takes existing local or external agents/teams and
  repairs them into the Agentlas architecture, including public plugin and
  one-line installer surfaces when requested.
- `40-session-agent-builder`: converts explicitly exported host sessions into a
  reviewed, reusable single-agent or team candidate without carrying raw
  conversation data into the package.

## Public Runtime Contracts

The following runtime behaviors are public contracts here, not private product
code:

- Agent Trust contract: agents are portable user assets with explicit package
  identity, owner-scoped private storage, public/private separation, local
  execution boundaries, governed learning, restore evidence, and no implied
  hosted Agent Cloud VM. Agentlas Terminal is an existing surface to harden,
  not a product to recreate.

- Mode classifier: choose `single-agent-creator`, `team-builder`, or
  `agentlas-packager` before generation.
- Clarify question loop: ask one to five package-shaping questions when the
  mode, runtime target, public boundary, tools, or safety constraints are
  unclear.
- Global command contract: every generated or packaged agent receives a
  canonical command, runtime command files or aliases, and a final
  `global_commands` handoff to the user.
- `.agentlas` auto-activation: local runtimes may create or merge public
  `.agentlas` seed files after explicit activation or repeated meaningful work
  in the same folder.
- Local credential store: local runtimes may materialize real values in
  gitignored project `.env`, `signing/`, and `credentials/` files, while public
  packages and memory keep only value-free names, paths, and stale-check rules.
  Project memory must place a `Local Credential Index (read first)` section near
  the top so release, deploy, store, billing, auth, API, and cloud work checks
  local credential locations before reporting a missing key.
- Skill lifecycle registry: generated packages may ship export-only candidate
  skill metadata, trial evidence ledgers, and Curator decision ledgers. Runtime
  first-class recall stays off until local Curator review and workspace policy
  approve it.
- Super Ontology candidate contract: generated packages may ship export-only
  adaptive knowledge governance metadata, coverage seeds, replay ledgers, and
  promotion evidence ledgers. Public exports keep graph writes value-free and
  candidate-only. In local operator mode, promotion gates are project, folder,
  owner, evidence, and rollback organization rules, not a generic security stop
  sign. Local promotion can proceed when those structures are named; public
  release claims still need replay, rollback, and sync evidence.
- Production Ontology Runtime: the public core includes a local-first runtime
  package that ingests supported files into SQLite, FTS5, deterministic local
  vectors, source-lineaged chunks, ontology entities and relations, GraphRAG
  query responses, Memory Curator candidate tickets, and Agent Working Memory
  cache entries. The runtime parses text, Markdown, JSON, CSV, DOCX, XLSX,
  PPTX, PDF text, HWPX, and OCR images when the local OCR engine is available.
  It blocks direct durable-memory writes and records missing external parsers as
  `unsupported_pending_adapter` instead of pretending success.
- Gateway channel contract: generated packages may declare Telegram, Slack,
  Discord, WhatsApp, email, SMS, and other messaging-channel needs with
  value-free credential references, sender policies, channel/account/peer
  bindings, delivery receipts, and pairing/admin gates. Raw provider tokens do
  not belong in public packages, Hub metadata, or memory.

## Generated Architecture Components

The following concepts are not separate meta-agent team members. They are
contracts that the four builders generate or repair inside output packages:

- PM Soul or project owner.
- Memory Curator and Memory Tickets.
- Skill lifecycle registry, trial evidence, and Curator promotion decisions.
- Super Ontology candidate contract, open-world coverage, consensus coordination, task coverage, contextual flow, causal
  impact, assurance cases, knowledge homeostasis, adversarial provenance,
  epistemic calibration, semantic alignment, resilience control, invariant verification,
  observability telemetry, objective proxy validity, stakeholder preference
  governance, strategic incentive compatibility, reflexive feedback stability,
  replay evidence, and
  promotion evidence.
- Sitemap and task bias.
- LLM runtime architecture.
- Global command registry.
- Policy Gate.
- Eval judge and QA/evidence gate.
- Thin runtime adapters.
- Local-first ontology runtime.
- Public-safety and install verification.

## Runtime Adapters

Adapters translate the same core into each runtime:

- Codex: `codex/marketplace.json` and
  `codex/plugins/agentlas-core-engine-meta-agent/`.
- Claude Code: `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`.
- Gemini CLI: `GEMINI.md`, `.gemini/GEMINI.md`, and
  `.gemini/commands/`.
- Generic AGENTS.md tools: root `AGENTS.md`.
- Ontology CLI: `bin/ontology` runs the local-first storage/search/graph/memory
  runtime from a shell.

Adapters should not contain private logic that is missing from the canonical
core.

## Packaging Flow

```text
existing prompt / agent / team / repo / zip
  -> Agentlas Packager
  -> inspect current structure
  -> classify single-agent or team package
  -> add AGENTS.md canonical core
  -> add or repair agentlas.json
  -> run Hephaestus security scan
  -> compile runtime bundle
  -> add .agentlas contracts
  -> assign global command
  -> add runtime adapters
  -> remove private or unsafe material from public output
  -> verify package
```

## Public Packaging Rule

A public package should look intentional at first glance:

- `README.md` explains the purpose.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` explains the system.
- `agents/` shows the four canonical meta-agent builder roles.
- `modes/` shows the four work modes.
- `skills/` shows reusable procedures.
- `schemas/` makes contracts explicit.
- `agentlas.json` defines the Cloud call entry, allow/deny reads, memory
  write-back policy, and public clean-copy policy.
- `scripts/verify-package.sh` proves the package shape.

Generated public packages also need `.agentlas/global-commands.json` and must
show the user the generated command after creation.
