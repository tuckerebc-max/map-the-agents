# twing-cli

twing helps multiple coding agents on a developer team coordinate with
each other instead of quietly stepping on the same work. It's a CLI +
hook for your coding agent (Claude Code today, others planned) plus a
small server every agent's client talks to.

Full design: `docs/orchestrator-and-verification-design-doc_v1.md`.

## Getting started

### 1. Install

```sh
npm install -g @twing/cli
```

Needs Node.js >= 20. No Go toolchain, no clone -- `twing-hook` (the
client's Go-side hook binary) is fetched automatically the first time
`twing init` needs one.

### 2. Point it at a coordinator

```sh
cd ~/path/to/some-repo
twing init --server https://coordination-server.twing.dev
```

`coordination-server.twing.dev` is twing's own hosted coordinator -- free
to use, no invite needed for a GitHub-hosted repo (`init` authenticates
you via GitHub itself, see step 2 of the walkthrough below). Once one
person's run this, the server URL is committed to `.twing/twing.yml`, so
everyone else afterward just runs plain `twing init`. Prefer to run your
own instead? See "Self-hosting your own coordinator" below.

`init` does three things:

1. **Resolves the coordinator** -- from the repo's committed
   `.twing/twing.yml`, `--server`/`TWING_SERVER`, or an interactive prompt
   if neither exists yet (just press Enter to accept twing's own hosted
   coordinator, shown as the default).
2. **Authenticates** -- verifies your GitHub permissions on this repo and
   mints a local PAT (only its hash reaches the server). Uses the `gh`
   CLI's token when one is available, falling back to a browser OAuth
   device flow. Admin/maintain access founds an untouched project and makes
   you its admin; any other repo access just joins it. Non-GitHub repos
   use a separate auth path -- see "Self-hosting your own coordinator"
   below. If this makes you the project's admin -- founding it, or later
   re-running `init` as one -- it also commits a bootstrap hook into this
   repo's own `.claude/settings.json`, so every future teammate gets twing
   set up automatically on their first edit; see "Zero-touch onboarding"
   below.
3. **Sets up the local pieces** -- installs `twing-hook`, wires it into
   Claude Code's hooks (once per machine), and starts a background daemon.
   The daemon exists because each hook invocation is a fresh, stateless
   process; the daemon is the long-running piece that actually watches
   your edits and syncs them to the server in the background.

Safe to re-run any time -- later runs just re-verify and re-point rather
than duplicating anything.

### 3. Using it day to day

Once `twing init` has run once on this machine, just work normally in
Claude Code in any repo whose `.twing/twing.yml` declares a coordinator --
hooks capture claims automatically in the background (divergence findings
surface reactively, via a session-start notice or an alignment thread --
`twing align` is there if you want to look yourself, but it's not something
you're expected to run proactively), and twing evaluates all your edits for
problems early on. It does this by doing the following:

1. **Forces a design** -- before an agent's first `Edit`/`Write` in a
   session, twing forces the agent to submit a design that describes what
   changes the agent intends to make.
2. **Checks constraints** -- if your codebase has protected areas set up
   (optional), twing checks whether your design touches any of those areas
   and, if so, submits a review for you. twing blocks further edits until
   your review is approved.
3. **Evaluates overlapping files** -- twing evaluates files that your agent
   wants to update. If other agents are also trying to modify the same
   files, it warns you.
4. **Flags conflicting symbol edits** -- if two agents are trying to modify
   the same symbol, twing flags and blocks. You can resolve it offline or
   through [twing monitor](https://github.com/Twing-dev/twing-monitor), and
   unblock yourself.
5. **Flags semantic conflicts** -- if two designs have conflicts,
   duplication, or tension between them, twing flags that. As above, you
   can resolve it offline or through twing monitor, and unblock yourself.

A full summary of what twing flags and when is below:

## The design-conflict gate

### The four conflict buckets

Every conflict a design can hit collapses into exactly one of four buckets.
One principle decides who resolves each: **approval belongs to whoever's
authority you'd be overriding.** Overriding your own peer's declared or
actual work is yours to waive; overriding a project-wide rule someone else
wrote isn't.

| #   | Bucket                 | Between                                                                                                                                                                 | Blocking?                                              | Resolved by                                                                                     | Sub-kinds                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 4   | `llm_divergence`       | two designs' _stated intent_ -- judged by an LLM (Bedrock) on what each plan actually does, even when file lists never overlap                                          | yes                                                    | **self**, same as `symbol_conflict`                                                             | `duplication` (same problem solved twice), `contradictory_assumptions` (one plan assumes true what the other assumes false), `tension` (the two plans' changes to shared behavior/data/contracts don't agree on which wins)          |

Implications of the split:

- **Only bucket 1 ever needs a human.** Buckets 3 and 4 exist because two
  peers' own work collided -- neither has more authority than the other, so
  whichever side is blocked can justify and clear it themselves
  (`resolve --justify` auto-decides "approve" the instant the review has no
  constraint hit in it). A justification that _also_ touches a constraint
  hit stays admin-gated regardless of what else is bundled with it.
- **Bucket 2 never blocks anything.** It's a plan-vs-plan heads-up before
  either side has actually touched a file -- useful context, never a gate.
  If it later becomes real (someone actually edits the shared symbol), that
  shows up separately as a bucket-3 `symbol_conflict`.
- **Buckets 1 and 3/4 differ in what they're checked against.** Bucket 1 is
  deterministic (a `.twing/twing.yml` rule, checked synchronously). Buckets
  3 and 4 are sourced from real signal -- Tree-sitter-parsed `Claim`s for
  bucket 3, an async Bedrock semantic-conflict pass for bucket 4 -- so
  either can arrive _after_ the triggering `Edit`/`Write` already succeeded,
  surfaced via `twing align` / an alignment thread rather than a synchronous
  deny.

```sh
twing design register --summary "adds a retry wrapper" --touches src/net/retry.ts
twing design amend --id <designId> --touches src/net/retry-config.ts
twing design close --id <designId>
```

A deny message always names the exact command to run next (`register`,
`amend`, `resume`, or `resolve --justify`) -- follow it, then retry. This
repo dogfoods its own gate against a real coordinator; see its own
`.twing/twing.yml` for a live example of the constraints it's checked
against.

A design left open past the point its work is actually done isn't harmless
-- it's still-live scope other sessions' conflict checks compare against,
so it can trigger a false overlap against someone else's genuinely
unrelated work. `SessionEnd` best-effort-closes every open/flagged/dormant
design for that session, and the TTL sweep eventually expires anything
older, but neither is immediate -- `twing design close --id <designId>`
closes one on demand, right when the work it named is finished, same as
`resolve`/`amend` targeting one specific design by id. Safe to call more
than once; closing an already-closed/superseded/expired design is a no-op.

Constraints (the project rules a design gets checked against for bucket 1
above, seeded from `.twing/twing.yml`'s `constraints:` section by
`twing init`) are separate from designs -- `twing constraints
list` shows what's currently enforced for a project, and any project admin
can `twing constraints remove --id <constraintId>` to retire a stale one
immediately. This is deliberately _unilateral_ -- one admin acting alone,
same as seeding a new/changed constraint already works today -- not a
second-admin-approves-first staged flow. That's a real gap (an admin could
narrow away a rule nobody else agreed to loosen) tracked as separate
follow-up work, not yet built.

### Project settings

`.twing/twing.yml` also carries a `settings:` block for the knobs a
project's admins may want to tune. It reaches the coordinator the same way
`constraints:` does -- pushed by `twing init`, which requires project
`admin` role on an already-founded project -- so an edit only takes effect
once someone with admin runs `init` on it:

```yaml
settings:
  # How long a design can sit with no activity before the coordinator
  # demotes it to `dormant` (excluded from conflict checks, still resumable
  # with `twing design resume`). Default 7d; between 5m and 90d.
  designDormantAfter: 7d
```

Durations are an integer plus `s`/`m`/`h`/`d` -- `7d`, `36h`, `90m`. A
value that's unparseable or out of range is reported by `init` and ignored
rather than rounded into range, and dropping the block entirely puts the
project back on the default.

Changing the window takes effect immediately, including for designs that
are already open -- seeding re-times the project's live designs as well as
setting the default for new ones, so shortening it doesn't wait out the old
window before it starts working. Designs that have already gone dormant are
left alone: their expiry is measured from the active window, so re-timing
them would retroactively delete work that went quiet under the old policy.
Once a design does go dormant it stays resumable for a further week before
expiring for good, independently of this setting.

## Zero-touch onboarding

Separate from the design-conflict gate above, and aimed at a different
problem: getting twing *onto* a teammate's machine without them having to do
anything.

Whoever founds a project (or already holds admin/maintain on it) has `init`
commit two git-tracked files: `.twing/bootstrap-hook.sh`, a small POSIX
shell script, and the `.claude/settings.json` entries that point Claude Code
at it. Every clone of the repo carries both, and the script runs on every
hook event -- the same set the machine-global wiring covers, so a machine
driven only by the committed files still gets the whole product rather than
just the gate. On a machine that has never run twing, it **installs twing
itself**:

```sh
npm install --prefix ~/.twing/lib @twing/cli@latest
node ~/.twing/lib/node_modules/@twing/cli/dist/index.js init --unattended
```

Nothing to type, no sudo, no browser -- the prefix is under your own home
directory, unlike `npm install -g`, and `--unattended` skips the one
privileged step. Installing into twing's own directory (rather than running
straight from `npx`) is deliberate: the daemon launch marker records that
path, and npm may evict its own cache at any time, which would leave a
marker that works today and silently stops working weeks later. Once the
binary is in place the hook `exec`s it, so the real design gate decides the
verdict as usual. Later runs are a `test -x` plus an `exec` -- no network,
no subprocess, no measurable cost.

**Why it installs rather than instructs.** Earlier versions denied the edit
and told the agent to run `npm install -g @twing/cli && twing init`. That
failed twice over. An install instruction arriving as *denied tool output*
is indistinguishable from a prompt-injection attempt, so a well-behaved
agent refuses it -- confirmed live, a real session refused even after its
operator explicitly said to proceed, and was right to. And `npm install -g`
needs a writable global prefix, so on a system-Node box it needs `sudo`,
which a hook (no TTY) can never supply: even a fully cooperative agent would
have failed. Enforcement is unchanged -- twing ends up active either way --
but the friction is gone.

**Authentication comes along for the ride.** An install with no credential
would just fail at the gate instead of at the install, so when running
unattended twing reuses the GitHub token from the `gh` CLI (`gh auth
token`) rather than starting the browser device flow. Same repo-permission
check, same server-derived role -- one less thing a human has to be present
for. If `gh` isn't installed or isn't logged in, the bootstrap reports that
plainly; `gh auth login` (or one interactive `twing init`) fixes it.

**It keeps itself current, too.** If the coordinator moves ahead of a
machine's twing, the gate updates that machine in place and replays the same
edit through the new binary -- so the edit simply proceeds. Nothing is asked
of anyone: on a machine where nobody installed twing, no twing command is
ever named, because none of them would run there (`npm install -g` needs
sudo on a system-Node box, and there is no `twing` on `PATH` at all). If the
update genuinely can't happen, you get an operational report pointing at
`~/.twing/design-coordinator.log`, not a command list.

**Installing twing yourself keeps working.** `npm install -g @twing/cli`
followed by `twing init` writes machine-global wiring, and the committed
script stands down the moment it sees `~/.claude/settings.json` already
referencing the binary -- Claude Code merges hooks from every settings scope
and runs all of them, so without that guard both would fire on every tool
call. Your copy is yours: twing won't replace a package you installed
deliberately, and version-mismatch and sign-in messages keep naming the
commands that genuinely work on your machine. Global wiring also covers the
one case the committed files can't -- a session started in a directory
*containing* twing repos rather than inside one, where there is no
repo-local settings file to load.

**Turning it on and off** -- both are plain local file edits, no server call
and no auth, since the real authorization is your own branch protection / PR
review on the committed file:

```sh
twing project enable-enforcement    # writes it
twing project disable-enforcement   # removes it
```

Remember to commit and push both files that `enable-enforcement`/`init`
writes (`.twing/bootstrap-hook.sh` and `.claude/settings.json`);
twing has no way to do that for you. Non-GitHub-hosted projects,
`--invite`/`--no-auth` onboarding, and repos founded before this existed
don't get the hook written automatically -- run `twing project
enable-enforcement` once you're that project's admin.

The script assumes a POSIX `sh` (macOS/Linux). Windows hook-execution
behavior for this mechanism hasn't been verified -- a known gap, same as
`init`'s OS-level service install.

**If the bootstrap fails** (no network, npm unreachable, no `gh`
credential), the hook denies with an *operational* report -- what failed and
who to tell -- explicitly not an instruction for the agent to install
anything another way. Only the `PreToolUse` entries can carry a verdict at
all; the rest stay silent rather than emit output for an event that has no
meaning for it. That is a rare path, not the default one.

### For agents: handling a design-gate deny

If an `Edit`/`Write` call comes back denied with a `twing design coordinator:
...` message, that's this gate, not a bug in your tool call and not something
to route around (e.g. by falling back to `Bash` to write the file directly --
nothing stops that mechanically, but it defeats the whole point). It exists
because this project assumes more than one agent or developer can be working
in the same repo at once, and it's trying to catch two of them stepping on
the same work before that becomes a merge conflict or a design disagreement
discovered too late.

Each deny message already tells you the specific command to run
(`twing design register`, `amend`, `resume`, or `resolve --justify`) -- or,
on a fresh session's very first deny, to check `twing design list --mine
--status open` first and join an existing open design of yours via `amend
--group` if one already covers the same effort, rather than registering a
new one for it. Follow whichever it tells you, then retry the original
edit. Two things worth knowing before you do:

- **`resolve --justify` unblocks you immediately for a `symbol_conflict` or
  `llm_divergence` deny, but not for `constraint_violation`.** The two
  peer-vs-peer buckets self-approve on the spot -- no one else's authority
  is being overridden, so the tool call reports `status: "resolved"` and
  the same edit succeeds on retry right away. A `constraint_violation`
  justification instead queues a `PendingReview` for a project admin
  (`twing design reviews --decide`); until that happens, the file stays
  denied with a message saying a review is pending. Don't loop retrying it
  in that case -- that's a stop-and-wait state, not a self-serviceable one.
  See "The four conflict buckets" above for which is which.
- **Tell the human what happened.** Registering, amending, or resuming a
  design creates a real record on the coordinator, attributed to the
  operator's own identity, that other sessions' conflict checks get
  compared against. If you resolve a deny and the edit goes through, say so
  explicitly in your reply -- which command you ran and why -- rather than
  reporting the original task as done with no mention that a coordination
  decision was made on the operator's behalf along the way. This is
  different from an ordinary failed tool call you're expected to just fix
  and move past silently (a typo'd path, a missing directory): this one
  represents someone else's work the gate is asking you to account for.

### For agents: close your design when you're actually done

A registered design doesn't expire the moment its task finishes -- it stays
`open` (visible to every other session's conflict/overlap checks) until
something closes it. That something should usually be you, not a fallback
mechanism: `SessionEnd` best-effort-closes your session's open designs, and
there's a TTL sweep behind that, but both are safety nets for a session
that ends abruptly, not a substitute for closing deliberately. An open
design that's actually finished work is exactly the kind of stale scope
that produces a false "overlap" against someone else's genuinely unrelated
change later in the same session or a concurrent one.

So: once the work a design named is actually complete -- the edit landed,
the task is done -- close it yourself:

```sh
twing design close --id <designId>
```

Do this before ending your turn if the task is finished, not just when a
human happens to ask. It's a normal, expected part of finishing work
through this gate, the same as `register` is part of starting it -- not
something that needs separate permission each time, and not something to
skip because `SessionEnd` will "probably get it eventually."

---

Everything below this line is for running your own coordinator or working
on twing-cli itself -- most people using twing day to day can stop here.

## Self-hosting your own coordinator

Two flavors, depending on who needs to be able to reach it.

### Local, or a small trusted team (`--no-auth`)

If everyone who can reach `twing serve` is already trusted -- your own
local agents, or a small team on a private network -- you don't need any
identity ceremony at all:

```sh
npm run start --workspace packages/server -- --no-auth
# elsewhere:
twing init --server <url> --no-auth
```

Every request just carries a self-declared developer id (derived from your
git email) for attribution in claims/findings -- there's no token, no
admin/member distinction, every check that would otherwise be role-gated
no-ops. `--no-auth` is sticky once cached: later plain `twing init` runs
against that server pick it back up automatically. The server still binds
to loopback only by default; passing a non-default `--host` logs a startup
warning, since a non-loopback bind plus `--no-auth` means anyone who can
reach the port can write claims as any developer id they name.

### Your own public, full-auth server

Run the coordinator (`packages/server`, a single process with no external
database -- see §7 of the design doc) wherever your team can reach it:

```sh
npm run start --workspace packages/server
# PORT=9000 to override the default 8787
```

It prints the URL it's listening on -- that's what you hand to `twing init
--server <url>`. It also generates a one-time **bootstrap token** on first
run and logs where to find it (`~/.twing/serve-data/bootstrap-token` by
default). This only matters for a project that can't use GitHub-verified
auth -- a GitHub-hosted project's `twing init` founds/joins it directly,
no bootstrap token involved.

**Running it on a shared machine** as a plain foreground command means it
dies when your SSH session ends and its logs go nowhere. `deploy/` has
scripts for running it as a systemd service under an isolated,
unprivileged user instead -- see `deploy/README.md`.

**Design checks made from plan text** (`ExitPlanMode`) need an LLM call to
turn the plan into structured fields, so wherever this runs needs an LLM
provider configured. The provider is **auto-detected** from which of these
env vars is set, in precedence order **AWS → GCP → OpenRouter → Bifrost**;
if none is set the plan-text check fails soft to "clean" (the
`Edit`/`Write` "must have a registered design" rule still applies). Each
provider also carries its own model config -- `TWING_<PROVIDER>_EXTRACT_MODEL`
/ `TWING_<PROVIDER>_SEMANTIC_CHECK_MODEL`, each defaulting to something
sensible for that provider -- so switching providers doesn't leave a
stale model id behind.

### Onboarding a non-GitHub-hosted project

(GitLab, self-hosted git, no remote at all) on a full-auth server -- or
founding/inviting on your own full-auth server generally, since the
bootstrap token is filesystem-gated and only the operator has it:

**1. Claim the first admin identity**, once per server, from whoever has
shell access to the machine `twing serve` runs on:

```sh
cat ~/.twing/serve-data/bootstrap-token         # the server logged this path at startup
twing admin bootstrap --server <url> --token <that>
```

This generates your personal access token **on your own machine** -- the
server only ever sees its hash, not even at bootstrap time -- and prints it
once. It's cached locally; nothing else to do.

**2. Found the project**, same as any project -- just run `twing init` (add
`--no-github` to skip straight past the GitHub-verified attempt if this
repo happens to have a GitHub remote you don't want used):

```sh
cd ~/path/to/some-repo
twing init --server <url>
```

**3. Invite the rest of your team.** Either that project's admin or the org
admin from step 1 can invite a new contributor directly -- an org admin
isn't required for every new teammate on every repo:

```sh
twing project invite --label alice@example.com --project <id>
# -> prints an invite code; hand it to Alice however you'd share anything else (Slack, etc.)
```

Alice redeems it in one step, from her own machine, generating her own PAT
locally the same way you generated yours -- nobody, including whoever
invited her, ever sees it:

```sh
twing init --server <url> --invite <code>
```

(`twing keygen --invite <code>` does just the authentication part, if you
don't want `init`'s hook install/daemon start bundled in.) An invite code
is single-use and expires after 7 days; `twing project list-invites` /
`twing admin list-invites` show pending ones, `twing project revoke-invite`
/ `twing admin revoke-invite` kill one early.

Already authenticated to this server from another project? Redeeming an
invite reuses your existing PAT instead of minting a second identity -- you
just pick up the new membership.

**Account recovery.** Lost your local `~/.twing/config.json`? If you
onboarded via GitHub, just re-run `twing init` (or `twing join --github`)
-- it re-verifies your GitHub role and reattaches to your existing identity
rather than minting a new one. That self-service path doesn't exist here,
on a non-GitHub project, so recovery instead means asking whoever has shell
access to the server to rotate your identity under the same label:

```sh
# on the machine running twing serve:
npm run start --workspace packages/server -- --regenerate-bootstrap-token
twing admin bootstrap --server <url> --token <that> --label you@example.com   # same label as before
```

**Not sure who to ask, or which project id to use?** Ask whoever founded
the project, or run `twing project list-developers` from inside the repo
(defaults to that repo's project id) to see current admins/members.

## Modifying twing-cli itself

Only relevant if you're contributing to this repo, not to use `twing`.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- git
- Go -- only needed for `hook/` itself; a checkout of this repo with Go on
  `PATH` builds `twing-hook` from source instead of fetching a release, so
  your own uncommitted `hook/` changes always take priority

### Build

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Twing-dev/twing-cli.git
cd twing-cli
npm install
npm run build
```

This builds every package (`packages/core`, `packages/cli`, `packages/server`)
via TypeScript project references. `npm link` in `packages/cli` gives you a
`twing` command that runs your local build instead of the npm-published one.

### Trying it against real agents

`simulator/` runs two real `claude` CLI sessions concurrently against a
shared fixture project to exercise `align` end to end -- see
`simulator/README.md`.
