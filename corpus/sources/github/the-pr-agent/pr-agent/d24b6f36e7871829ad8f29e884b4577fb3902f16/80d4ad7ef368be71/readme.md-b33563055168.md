 This repository contains the open-source PR Agent Project.
 It is not the Qodo offering for open-source projects.

PR-Agent is an open-source, AI-powered code review agent and a community-maintained legacy project of Qodo. It is distinct from Qodo's primary AI code review offering, which provides a feature-rich, context-aware experience. Qodo offers a free version for open-source projects and integrates seamlessly with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps for high-quality automated reviews.


## Sponsors

PR-Agent is a community-maintained open-source project, with its ongoing development supported by our sponsors. If you'd like to support the project, consider [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/naorpeled).

## Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> **Docker Hub namespace migration.** Releases `0.34.2` and later are published under [`pragent/pr-agent`](https://hub.docker.com/r/pragent/pr-agent). Older releases (up to and including `v0.31`) remain available at the legacy [`codiumai/pr-agent`](https://hub.docker.com/r/codiumai/pr-agent) namespace as a frozen archive — no new images are pushed there. Update any pinned `image:` / `docker pull` / `uses: docker://` references when upgrading to `0.34.2+`.

### 🚀 Quick Start for PR-Agent

#### 1. GitHub Action (Recommended)

Add automated PR reviews to your repository with a simple workflow file:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-agent.yml
name: PR Agent
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
jobs:
  pr_agent_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: PR Agent action step
      uses: the-pr-agent/pr-agent@main
      env:
        OPENAI_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_KEY }}
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
[Full GitHub Action setup guide](https://docs.pr-agent.ai/installation/github/#run-as-a-github-action)

#### 2. CLI Usage (Local Development)

Run PR-Agent locally on your repository:

```bash
pip install pr-agent
export OPENAI_KEY=your_key_here
pr-agent --pr_url https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 review
```
[Complete CLI setup guide](https://docs.pr-agent.ai/usage-guide/automations_and_usage/#local-repo-cli)

#### 3. Other Platforms

- [GitLab webhook setup](https://docs.pr-agent.ai/installation/gitlab/)
- [BitBucket app installation](https://docs.pr-agent.ai/installation/bitbucket/)
- [Azure DevOps setup](https://docs.pr-agent.ai/installation/azure/)

## Why Use PR-Agent?

### 🎯 Built for Real Development Teams

**Fast & Affordable**: Each tool (`/review`, `/improve`, `/ask`) uses a single LLM call (~30 seconds, low cost)

**Handles Any PR Size**: Our [PR Compression strategy](https://docs.pr-agent.ai/core-abilities/#pr-compression-strategy) effectively processes both small and large PRs

**Highly Customizable**: JSON-based prompting allows easy customization of review categories and behavior via [configuration files](pr_agent/settings/configuration.toml)

**Platform Agnostic**:
- **Git Providers**: GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, Azure DevOps, Gitea
- **Deployment**: CLI, GitHub Actions, Docker, self-hosted, webhooks
- **AI Models**: OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral, and any other model reachable through LiteLLM (Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Vertex AI, Databricks, OpenRouter, Ollama, and more) — see [Changing a model](https://docs.pr-agent.ai/usage-guide/changing_a_model/)

**Open Source Benefits**:
- Full control over your data and infrastructure
- Customize prompts and behavior for your team's needs
- No vendor lock-in
- Community-driven development

## Features

<div style="text-align:left;">

See the current [feature and git provider support matrix](https://docs.pr-agent.ai/#features) in the PR-Agent documentation.

⚠️ `/help_docs` is temporarily disabled since `v0.36.1` pending a fix for a credential-exposure issue ([#2445](https://github.com/the-pr-agent/pr-agent/issues/2445)).

[//]: # (- Support for additional git providers is described in [here]&#40;./docs/Full_environments.md&#41;)

### Usage Examples

PR-Agent tools run as a comment on a PR or from the CLI. A few common ones:

```bash
# Comment on a PR (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket/…):
/describe
/review
/improve
/ask "What does this PR change?" # free-text Q&A about the PR

# Or locally via the CLI:
pr-agent --pr_url <PR_URL> review
```

See the [Tools docs](https://docs.pr-agent.ai/tools/#usage-examples) for the full list of tools with example commands, and each tool's page for screenshots and options.

## Data Privacy

### Self-hosted PR-Agent

- If you host PR-Agent with your OpenAI API key, it is between you and OpenAI. You can read their API data privacy policy here:
https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy

## Contributing

To contribute to the project, get started by reading our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/the-pr-agent/pr-agent/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

For local verification, run `PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest` from the repository root; it discovers the unit-test suite under `tests/unittest` by default. End-to-end tests under `tests/e2e_tests` require provider credentials and should be invoked explicitly, for example `PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest tests/e2e_tests/test_github_app.py`.


## Big News for PR-Agent

PR-Agent has a new home!

After years of building this tool alongside the community, Qodo has donated PR-Agent to the open-source community - and we couldn't be more excited about what comes next.

The project now lives in the PR-Agent org on GitHub, is fully community-owned, and is open for contributions and additional maintainers.

What else changed:
- Docs moved to - [docs.pr-agent.ai](https://docs.pr-agent.ai/)
- Qodo Merge (Qodo 1.0), the hosted URL, which was the enterprise version of PR-Agent, has been rebranded and evolved into Qodo (Qodo 2.0), a full AI code review platform.

## ❤️ Community

This open-source release remains here as a community contribution from Qodo — the origin of modern AI-powered code collaboration. We’re proud to share it and inspire developers worldwide.

The project now has its first external maintainer, Naor ([@naorpeled](https://github.com/naorpeled)), and is currently in the process of being donated to an open-source foundation.
