# Deploy to Databricks Apps

## Prerequisites

- A Databricks workspace with Model Serving endpoints enabled

## Easy Start (Git Repo)

The simplest way — no CLI, no cloning, everything stays in the Databricks UI.

1. Go to **Databricks → Apps → Create App**
2. Choose **Custom App** and connect this Git repo:
   ```
   https://github.com/datasciencemonkey/coding-agents-databricks-apps.git
   ```
3. Click **Deploy**
4. Open the app — on first terminal session, paste a short-lived PAT when prompted

The app pulls the code directly from Git. To update later, just re-deploy — it picks up the latest from the repo.

> **Note:** On first startup, the app automatically removes the template's `.git` history and reinitializes a clean, remote-free git repo. This prevents accidental pushes back to the template repo from the in-browser terminal.

> **Optional (Highly Recommended):** If you use [Databricks AI Gateway](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ai-gateway/), also add `DATABRICKS_GATEWAY_HOST` as a secret or environment variable. Otherwise the app falls back to direct model serving endpoints.

## Alternative: Deploy with CLI

If you prefer working from the terminal or need more control:

### 1. Clone the repo into your workspace

```bash
databricks repos create \
  --url https://github.com/datasciencemonkey/coding-agents-databricks-apps.git \
  --path /Workspace/Users/<your-email>/apps/coding-agents-databricks-apps
```

### 2. Configure `app.yaml`

In the cloned workspace folder, copy the template and edit it:

```bash
cp app.yaml.template app.yaml
```

Set your `DATABRICKS_GATEWAY_HOST`, or remove the gateway lines to fall back to direct model serving endpoints.

### 3. Create the app and deploy

```bash
databricks apps create <your-app-name>
```

No secrets or resources to configure. On first terminal session, paste a short-lived PAT when prompted — all CLIs are configured automatically.

### 4. Deploy

```bash
databricks apps deploy <your-app-name> \
  --source-code-path /Workspace/Users/<your-email>/apps/coding-agents-databricks-apps
```

> **Tip:** To update later, just `git pull` in the workspace repo and re-deploy.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` | No | Optional. If not set, the app prompts for a token on first session. Auto-rotated every 10 minutes |
| `HOME` | Yes | Set to `/app/python/source_code` in app.yaml |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | No | Claude model name (default: `databricks-claude-opus-4-7`) |
| `CODEX_MODEL` | No | Codex model name (default: `databricks-gpt-5-5`) |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | No | Gemini model name (default: `databricks-gemini-2-5-pro`) |
| `HERMES_MODEL` | No | Hermes model name (default: `databricks-claude-opus-4-7`) |
| `DATABRICKS_GATEWAY_HOST` | No | AI Gateway URL override. Auto-discovered from `DATABRICKS_WORKSPACE_ID` if unset. Falls back to direct model serving if neither is available |

## Security Model

This is a **single-user, zero-config auth** app. No secrets or tokens are required at deploy time.

1. **Owner resolution**: The app owner is determined from `app.creator` via the service principal + Apps API — no PAT needed
2. **Authorization**: Each request's `X-Forwarded-Email` header is compared against `app.creator`. Non-matching users see 403
3. **Interactive PAT setup**: On first terminal session, the user pastes a short-lived PAT interactively. All CLIs (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini, Hermes, Databricks) are configured automatically
4. **Auto-rotation**: PAT rotates every 10 minutes with a 15-minute lifetime. Old tokens are proactively revoked. Maximum leaked-token exposure: 15 minutes
5. **Session-aware**: Rotation is skipped when no active terminal sessions exist
6. **On restart**: The user re-pastes a token (no persistence by design)

## Gunicorn Configuration

Production uses Gunicorn (`gunicorn.conf.py`) with:
- `workers=1` — PTY file descriptors and in-memory session state can't survive forking
- `threads=8` — Handles concurrent polling from the terminal client
- `worker_class=gthread` — Single process + thread pool
- `post_worker_init` hook calls `initialize_app()` to start setup

## Workspace Sync

Git commits automatically sync projects to Databricks Workspace:

```
/Workspace/Users/{email}/projects/{project-name}/
```

The post-commit hook uses `nohup ... & disown` to ensure the sync process survives across all coding agents, since some agents kill the entire process group when a shell command finishes.
