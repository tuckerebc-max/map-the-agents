# acq Backend Guide

`acq` supports multiple isolation backends behind one command surface. As of
the **2.x** release line, two backends ship: **sbx** (Docker Sandboxes) and
**msb** (microsandbox). Kits are authored once in the neutral `hybrid/v1`
vocabulary and translated to each backend's native mechanism (see
[ADR-0011](adr/0011-msb-backend-and-neutral-kits.md)).

| Backend | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **sbx** | Shipped | Docker-based sbx CLI from Docker Inc |
| **msb** | Shipped | microsandbox — lightweight microVM isolation (FOSS); **default backend** |
| **ppp** | Phase 3 / in development | Podman-Plus-Proxy backend ([GSA-TTS/ppp](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/ppp)) |

## sbx Backend

### Overview

The **sbx** backend wraps the [sbx CLI](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/)
from Docker Inc. It provides:

- Container-based isolation
- Declarative kit composition (mixin kits applied at create time)
- Built-in secret proxy injection (secrets never enter the container)
- SSH key forwarding for git signing
- Persistent sandbox state across sessions

### Strengths

- **Production-ready**: Docker-backed, mature tooling
- **Secret proxy**: USAi key, GitHub token, and other secrets are injected by
  the proxy — the agent never sees them directly
- **Kit ecosystem**: Reuses all four community kits unchanged (`usai-provider`,
  `agentic-coding-playbook`, `zscaler-ca-certificate`, `git-ssh-sign`)
- **In-place healing**: Missing kits are added with `sbx kit add` on reconnect
  without losing sandbox state (requires sbx >= 0.35.0). **Note (sbx 0.38+):**
  `sbx kit add` no longer applies startup-bearing kits mid-life (see the
  limitation note below), so the built-in bundle can only be
  extended/refreshed by recreating the sandbox.
- **Port forwarding**: Supports `--publish` for exposing agent web UIs

### Requirements

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| `sbx` CLI | >= 0.38.0 | acq's neutral-kit translator emits the sbx v2 kit grammar, which only sbx >= 0.38.0 accepts (older builds fail with an opaque `field permissions not found` decode error). `sbx kit add` in-place healing needs >= 0.35.0. |
| Docker account | any | Required for `sbx login` |
| Docker subscription seat | (org-dependent) | Some orgs require paid seats |

### Installation

See [README.md](../README.md#step-2-install-sbx-cli) for step-by-step
install instructions for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### Configuration

```bash
# Persist sbx as the backend
./acq backend set sbx

# Per-invocation override
./acq --backend sbx run opencode /proj

# Environment override
export ACQ_BACKEND=sbx
```

### Capability flags

| Flag | Value | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| `ACQ_BACKEND_SUPPORTS_PORT_FORWARD` | 1 | `acq ports` is supported |
| `ACQ_BACKEND_SUPPORTS_SNAPSHOTS` | 0 | No snapshot support |
| `ACQ_BACKEND_CAN_RESUME` | 1 | Sandboxes persist between sessions |
| `ACQ_BACKEND_SUPPORTS_CREDENTIAL_REWRITE` | 1 | Secret proxy injection |

### Known limitations

- `sbx kit add` (healing) is experimental; see
  [KNOWN_FAILURE_MODES.md](KNOWN_FAILURE_MODES.md)
- **sbx 0.38 cannot extend a live sandbox with startup-bearing kits.**
  `sbx kit add` on 0.38 only applies mixin kits declaring exclusively
  `environment.variables`, `setup.install`, and `permissions.network.allow`; a
  kit declaring `setup.startup` is refused mid-life. Every built-in acq kit
  declares startup commands, so on sbx 0.38 the built-in bundle can be
  extended/refreshed **only by recreating the sandbox** (`acq rm && acq run`).
  acq's heal path, `acq kit apply`, and `acq kit update` detect the refusal and
  print that guidance instead of failing opaquely. msb is unaffected (it
  re-applies kits idempotently via `msb exec`). See the update note in
  [ADR-0009](adr/0009-require-sbx-0.35.0-in-place-kit-healing.md).
  Live-verify this behavior on an sbx host with `./scripts/verify-issue-320`.
- The sbx `docker sandbox` commands (deprecated by Docker) must not be used;
  use `sbx` CLI directly

## msb Backend (microsandbox, default)

The **msb** backend wraps [microsandbox](https://github.com/superradcompany/microsandbox),
an open-source (Apache-2.0) microVM runtime. It is a good fit when you want a
FOSS runtime with no Docker account/seat, snapshot/restore, or an SDK-first
automation story.

### Overview

- microVM isolation (libkrun) with per-sandbox network policy
- Runs standard OCI images (Docker Hub, GHCR, any registry)
- Native host-CA trust propagation (`--trust-host-cas`)
- Native TLS interception + host-env secret binding (`--secret ENV@HOST`) so
  credentials never enter the guest
- Snapshot/restore and detached long-running sandboxes

### Strengths

- **No Docker account required** — FOSS binary, `msb self update` to upgrade
- **Zscaler CA shortcut**: the `zscaler-ca-certificate` kit takes msb's native
  `--trust-host-cas` path instead of the file-drop + `update-ca-certificates`
  dance (behavioral parity — the guest trusts the Zscaler CA either way)
- **Secret injection**: the USAi key and a GitHub token are bound from host env
  vars at create time (`--secret USAI_API_KEY@api.gsa.usai.gov`,
  `--secret GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com,api.github.com,codeload.github.com`); the real values never enter the VM.
  **Any** custom-endpoint secret stored with `acq secret set SVC --host H --env E`
  is bound generically the same way — no fixed usai/github table
- **Snapshots**: microsandbox has a full `msb snapshot` CLI verb
  (create/list/inspect/verify/remove/save/load, `run --from-snapshot`), but
  `acq` does not surface it — wiring `acq snapshot` is beyond sbx parity, so
  `SUPPORTS_SNAPSHOTS=0` reflects what `acq` surfaces (not what msb can do); see
  Known limitations

### Requirements

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| `msb` CLI | >= 0.6.8 | `--net-rule`, `--trust-host-cas`, `--secret`, and the `--net-default-egress` split (0.6.8) used by acq's balanced-egress default. Host ssh-agent forwarding for git signing additionally needs msb >= 0.6.9 (`--vsock`; [ADR-0021](adr/0021-msb-host-ssh-agent-forwarding-via-vsock.md)) — it warns and skips on older msb without changing this 0.6.8 floor. |
| Host virtualization | — | Linux: KVM (`/dev/kvm`); macOS: HVF (Apple Silicon); Windows: WHP |

Run `msb doctor` to check host readiness (`msb doctor --fix` attempts setup).

### Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.microsandbox.dev | sh        # macOS / Linux
brew install superradcompany/tap/microsandbox           # Homebrew
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Persist msb as the default backend
./acq backend set msb

# Per-invocation override
./acq --backend msb run opencode /proj

# Environment override
export ACQ_BACKEND=msb
```

Tunables:

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `ACQ_MSB_IMAGE` | (unset) | Backend-specific base OCI image override. A custom override must be pullable and ship the base-image prerequisites. **Precedence (ADR-0022):** an explicitly set `ACQ_MSB_IMAGE` wins over the backend-neutral `--image`/`ACQ_IMAGE` (a one-time notice is printed); if only the neutral knob is set, it is used; otherwise msb derives `docker.io/docker/sandbox-templates:<agent>-docker` for known agents (with `claude` → `claude-code-docker` and `cursor` → `cursor-agent-docker`) and falls back to `docker.io/docker/sandbox-templates:shell-docker` if that derived image is not found. |
| `ACQ_IMAGE` | (unset) | Backend-**neutral** base image (ADR-0022). On msb it feeds `ACQ_MSB_IMAGE` (above); on sbx it maps to `sbx create --template <ref>`. Equivalent to the `acq run/create --image <ref>` flag (the flag wins over the env var). See [Custom base image](#custom-base-image---image--acq_image). |
| `ACQ_MSB_PULL` | (unset → msb default `if-missing`) | Image pull policy forwarded to `msb create --pull` (`always` \| `if-missing` \| `never`). `msb create` treats the image as a **registry** reference; a locally-built/registry-less image must first be imported with `msb image load -i <tar> -t <ref>`, then created with `ACQ_MSB_PULL=never` so msb uses the cache instead of trying to pull it. |
| `ACQ_MSB_SKIP_PREREQ_CHECK` | (unset) | Skip the base-image prerequisite presence check |
| `ACQ_SKIP_MSB_DOCTOR` | (unset) | Skip the automatic host-readiness check (`msb doctor`, and the `msb doctor --fix` it runs when the host is not ready). Set when the check is unreliable in your environment or you prefer to run it yourself. |
| `ACQ_OPENCODE_POSTINSTALL_TIMEOUT` | `120` | Seconds to bound opencode's in-guest `postinstall.mjs` (which fetches a platform binary) so a wedged registry can't hang `acq run`; used only when the guest provides `timeout` |
| `ACQ_MSB_OPENCODE_PKG` | `opencode-ai` | npm package spec for the opencode install (pin e.g. `opencode-ai@1.2.3`) |
| `ACQ_MSB_NPM_HOSTS` | `registry.npmjs.org` | npm registry host(s) to allow-list for the agent install (space-separated; set for an internal mirror) |
| `ACQ_MSB_ENSURE_OCI` | `1` (on) | Provision an OCI container engine (podman) at create so agents can run OCI images (`docker run`, `docker compose`). Installs `ACQ_MSB_PODMAN_PKGS` and aliases `docker` → `podman`. Set `0`/`false`/`no`/`off`/empty to skip (e.g. a base that bakes its own working engine). Fails soft if the OS package mirror is unreachable. See ADR-0020. |
| `ACQ_MSB_PODMAN_PKGS` | `podman podman-compose` | Packages installed to provide the OCI engine (space-separated). `podman-compose` is the `docker compose` / `podman compose` provider. Override for a different set or an internal mirror's names. |
| `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER` | `balanced` | Neutral egress posture (`strict`\|`balanced`\|`open`), the backend-agnostic selector defined by the agentic-coding-patterns network-tiers contract (ADR-0002). **All tiers are deny-by-default except `open`**; the tier only sizes the baseline allowlist. `strict` = `--net-default-egress deny` + gateway DNS + the kits' own `caps.network.allow` hosts ONLY (recommended for GFE / high-assurance). `balanced` = the same deny-default + the curated sbx-`balanced` baseline (ADR-0018) unioned with the kit hosts. `open` = **unrestricted egress** (no deny-default); testing only, never for GFE, and refused unless `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER_CONFIRM_OPEN=1`. Invalid values fail closed to `balanced`. |
| `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER_CONFIRM_OPEN` | (unset) | Required confirmation for `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER=open`. Set to `1` to acknowledge that the sandbox runs with unrestricted egress; otherwise `open` is refused at provision time (fail-closed). Treated like `--privileged` — never a default. |
| `ACQ_MSB_BALANCED_EGRESS` | (deprecated) | **Deprecated alias** for `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER`; retained for one deprecation window and removed in a future major. A `1`/on value maps to `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER=balanced`; a `0`/`false`/`no`/`off`/empty value maps to `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER=strict` (deny-by-default, kit hosts only — a former "off" no longer means permissive; an upgrade never silently loosens egress). `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER` wins when both are set, and a one-time notice is printed. Migrate to `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER`; use `open` if you truly need unrestricted egress. |
| `ACQ_MSB_BALANCED_HOSTS_FILE` | `<repo>/acq.backends/msb-balanced-hosts.txt` | Path to the vendored host list (a verbatim mirror of `sbx policy inspect local-policy`). Override for a site-specific egress set. |
| `ACQ_MSB_WORKSPACE` | (first workspace) | Agent's **starting directory** (`-w`) on attach. Does NOT change the mount, which is always host-path:host-path; overrides only where the agent starts. |
| `ACQ_MSB_MEMORY` | `4G` | Guest RAM at create (`-m`); `4G`/`4096`/`512M` (bare = MiB). Set empty to use msb's 512 MiB default |
| `ACQ_MSB_CPUS` | `2` | Guest vCPU count at create (`-c`); set empty to use msb's 1-vCPU default |
| `ACQ_MSB_DNS_NAMESERVER` | (host resolvers) | Force a guest DNS resolver (`--dns-nameserver`); empty uses the host's resolvers via msb's default |
| `ACQ_MSB_DNS_REBIND_PROTECTION` | (auto) | msb's DNS rebind protection at create. Empty = auto: off when a host resolver is in `100.64.0.0/10` (ZPA), so split-horizon names that resolve to private `100.64.x` addresses still resolve; on everywhere else. `1` always keeps it; `0` always disables it (escape hatch when detection misses) |
| `ACQ_MSB_KIT_CACHE` | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/acq/kits` | where fetched neutral kits are materialized |
| `ACQ_MSB_EXEC_READY_TIMEOUT` | `60` | Seconds to wait for a freshly-created sandbox to accept `msb exec` (create starts asynchronously) |
| `ACQ_MSB_SSH_DIR` | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/acq/ssh` | Directory holding acq's managed SSH key for post-hoc port publishing (ADR-0015) |
| `ACQ_MSB_SSH_KEY` | `$ACQ_MSB_SSH_DIR/msb_id_ed25519` | Managed SSH private key used to open `ssh -L` port tunnels |
| `ACQ_MSB_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` | `$ACQ_MSB_SSH_DIR/known_hosts` | known_hosts file for the managed port-forward SSH |
| `ACQ_MSB_SSH_USER` | `root` | Guest user for the post-hoc port-forward SSH session |
| `ACQ_MSB_PORTS_DIR` | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/acq/ports` | Per-sandbox state for post-hoc published-port tunnels (serve + ssh PIDs) |
| `ACQ_MSB_SSH_AGENT_VSOCK_PORT` | `3552` | Guest `AF_VSOCK` port the host ssh-agent is forwarded to (`--vsock`; avoids msb's reserved 123). Host ssh-agent forwarding, [ADR-0021](adr/0021-msb-host-ssh-agent-forwarding-via-vsock.md) |
| `ACQ_MSB_SSH_AGENT_GUEST_SOCK` | `/home/agent/.acq/ssh-agent.sock` | In-guest unix socket the `socat` bridge exposes and exports as `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` (git signing) |
| `ACQ_FORWARD_HOST_SOCKETS` | (unset) | General host-socket forwarding: `PATH:PORT[/stream|/dgram][,...]` emitted as `--vsock` routes. The host ssh-agent forward is the automatic special case built on this vocab (ADR-0021) |

### DNS / name resolution

msb forwards guest DNS from its host-side network stack to the **host's**
resolvers, so the guest resolves names exactly as the host does — including
split-horizon names on a corporate tunnel. On a Zscaler/ZPA host,
`gitlab.login.gov` and `api.gsa.usai.gov` resolve to private `100.64.x`
addresses that ride the tunnel's allow-listed path; a public resolver returns
the public load balancer instead, which either rejects the flow (`403` from the
ELB) or is unreachable. acq therefore leaves the resolver at msb's default, and
on such a host passes `--no-dns-rebind-protection`, because msb's rebind
protection would drop those private-range answers.

**Detection rule.** At `msb create`, acq reads the host's resolver list from
`/etc/resolv.conf`, which on macOS mirrors the global DNS state msb itself
reads. If any resolver sits in `100.64.0.0/10`, the CGNAT range ZPA uses
for both its resolvers and its synthetic app addresses, acq disables rebind
protection and prints one line saying so. A host with no such resolver keeps
msb's default (protection on) and sees no change. `ACQ_MSB_DNS_REBIND_PROTECTION`
takes three values:

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| unset / empty | auto: off on a host with a `100.64/10` resolver, on otherwise |
| `1` / `true` / `on` | always keep the protection (tunnel-only names then fail to resolve) |
| `0` / `false` / `off` | always disable it |
| anything else | warns and falls back to auto |

This is decided at create time; an existing sandbox keeps whatever it was
created with until it is recreated. If the tunnel was down when the sandbox was
created, detection misses and tunnel-only names fail later; recreate with
`ACQ_MSB_DNS_REBIND_PROTECTION=0` to force it off.

Security trade-off: msb maps a kit's `allow@host` rule onto the resolved IP, and
rebind protection is what stops that mapping from admitting a private address.
With it off, an allowed domain whose DNS an attacker can influence could steer
the guest at private space (other tunnel app segments, the msb gateway) under
that rule. The guard is relaxed only on hosts whose resolvers already return
private answers for the names the kits allow, and the exposure is bounded:
only named kit hosts are allowed under strict/balanced, their answers come from
the host's corporate resolver over the tunnel, IP-group rules (`allow@public`)
never admit private addresses, and injected secrets are bound to the upstream
TLS identity, so a rebound endpoint cannot receive them.
`ACQ_MSB_DNS_NAMESERVER` forces a specific resolver if the host's cannot be
used.

### Network egress tiers (`ACQ_NETWORK_TIER`)

Egress posture is selected by the **neutral network tier**, `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER`
(`strict` | `balanced` | `open`, default `balanced`). This is the
backend-agnostic vocabulary defined by the agentic-coding-patterns
network-tiers contract (its ADR-0002); each backend maps the tier to its native
egress primitive. **All tiers are deny-by-default except `open`** — the tier
only sizes the baseline allowlist:

| Tier | Meaning | msb emission |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `strict` | Deny-by-default; the kits' own `caps.network.allow` hosts ONLY. Recommended for GFE / high-assurance. | `--net-default-egress deny` + gateway DNS (`allow@host:udp:53`/`:tcp:53`) + the kit `allow@…` rules. No baseline. |
| `balanced` (default) | Deny-by-default + the curated sbx-`balanced` baseline, unioned with the kit hosts. | `--net-default-egress deny` + the vendored baseline rules + gateway DNS + the kit `allow@…` rules. |
| `open` | Unrestricted egress. **Testing only, never for GFE.** | No deny-default emitted; kit/npm/secret `allow@…` rules ride msb's own (permissive) egress default. Refused unless `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER_CONFIRM_OPEN=1`. |

The effective allowlist is `tier baseline ∪ per-kit caps.network.allow ∪ any
per-sandbox additions`, always under deny-by-default (for `strict`/`balanced`).

sbx ships a **`balanced`** network policy (the recommended sbx default) that
allows a broad set of developer hosts — AI services, package registries,
code/container hosts, cloud infrastructure, OS package mirrors, and
certificate-validation endpoints — and blocks everything else. msb has no
equivalent default; its egress is deny-by-default with only the hosts the kits
declare (plus the npm registry when installing an agent).

To reach parity, the msb backend's `balanced` tier applies the **same host set
as sbx `balanced`**: at create it emits `--net-default-egress deny` plus one
`allow@<host>:tcp:<port>` rule per entry in the vendored list
`acq.backends/msb-balanced-hosts.txt` (a verbatim mirror of `sbx policy inspect
local-policy`), plus gateway-DNS rules (`allow@host:udp:53` +
`allow@host:tcp:53`) for name resolution. Egress is therefore
*restricted to* the balanced set (deny-by-default + allowlist), composed with the
kits' own `caps.network.allow` rules.

- **Egress only.** The deny-default is scoped to egress (`--net-default-egress`,
  not the symmetric `--net-default`). Ingress keeps msb's baseline `allow`, so
  create-time `-p HOST:GUEST` published ports stay reachable — a symmetric deny
  would RST inbound to them (see [ADR-0019](adr/0019-msb-balanced-egress-is-egress-only.md)).
- **Select the tier** with `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER` (default `balanced`). Use `strict`
  for kit-hosts-only deny-by-default; `open` (with `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER_CONFIRM_OPEN=1`)
  to disable the deny-default for testing only.
- **Customize** the `balanced` baseline by pointing `ACQ_MSB_BALANCED_HOSTS_FILE`
  at your own list.
- **`ACQ_MSB_BALANCED_EGRESS` is deprecated** — it now aliases `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER`:
  a `1`/on value maps to `balanced`; a `0`/off/empty value maps to `strict` (a
  former "off" is now deny-by-default with kit hosts only, NOT permissive — an
  upgrade never silently loosens egress). Migrate to `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER`.
- **Wildcards / ports:** sbx `**.host` / `*.host` become msb domain-suffix
  `*.host`; the intra-label glob `crl*.digicert.com` is broadened to
  `*.digicert.com` (msb has no intra-label glob — this is logged and is the one
  spot the msb set is intentionally wider than sbx); a host on both `:80` and
  `:443` yields two rules.
- **Drift:** the vendored file is a point-in-time snapshot. Re-sync it from `sbx
  policy inspect local-policy` on the quarterly review cadence (see
  `docs/KNOWN_FAILURE_MODES.md`).
- **QUIC / HTTP-3.** The balanced rules are `tcp:443` only, and `--tls-intercept`
  (required for secret substitution) blocks QUIC unless `--no-block-quic` is set.
  So HTTP/3-only egress to an allowed `:443` host is denied and a well-behaved
  client falls back to TLS-over-TCP automatically — the same behavior as sbx
  `balanced`. A one-time slow first connection while a client tries QUIC and falls
  back is expected, not a bug.
- **Requires msb >= 0.6.8.** The egress-only deny-default uses the
  `--net-default-egress` flag, which first appears in msb 0.6.8. `acq` enforces
  this floor (`MIN_MSB_VERSION`) and fails closed with a clear version message on
  an older binary, rather than passing an unknown flag to `msb create`.

See [ADR-0018](adr/0018-msb-balanced-egress-baseline.md) for the full rationale,
and [ADR-0019](adr/0019-msb-balanced-egress-is-egress-only.md) for why the
deny-default is egress-only.

### Guest memory and vCPU

msb defaults a sandbox to **512 MiB of RAM and 1 vCPU**, and the microVM has
**no swap** — so a process that exceeds guest RAM is OOM-killed by the guest
kernel and simply prints `Killed`. A Node.js agent TUI like `opencode` blows past
512 MiB immediately, which looked like "opencode starts, then the terminal dies".
sbx sizes its agent templates generously; a plain msb
base does not, so the msb backend passes `--memory 4G --cpus 2` at create by
default. Tune with `ACQ_MSB_MEMORY` / `ACQ_MSB_CPUS` (set either empty to fall
back to msb's own default). Memory takes a single-char unit suffix — `G`/`g` =
GiB, `M`/`m` = MiB, bare number = MiB — so `4G`, `4096`, and `4g` are equivalent.

### Workspace mounting

msb does **not** create the host mount path, so each host workspace path must
already exist — `acq` errors clearly if one does not.

The msb backend mounts every workspace at the **same absolute path inside the
guest** (matching sbx's multi-workspace semantics — see the canonical
[Multiple Workspaces](CONCEPTS.md#multiple-workspaces) concept): `acq run
opencode /my/repo` makes the repo appear at `/my/repo` in the sandbox. Extra
workspaces and a trailing `:ro` marker work the same as sbx:

```bash
acq --backend msb run opencode ~/projects/app ~/projects/lib:ro
# mounts ~/projects/app (rw) and ~/projects/lib (ro), each at its host path
```

**Starting directory:** the agent starts in the **primary** (first) workspace,
matching sbx (see [Multiple Workspaces](CONCEPTS.md#multiple-workspaces):
"Primary workspace — the first path; the agent starts here"). Override the start
dir with `ACQ_MSB_WORKSPACE`.

**Symlinked host paths are canonicalized.** msb cannot mount a symlinked host
path — it fails to start with `mount ...: Not a directory (os error 20)`, even
when mapped to a shallow guest target (verified on msb 0.6.6). The most common
case is **macOS `$TMPDIR`**, a per-user `/var/folders/...` tree reached through
the `/var` → `/private/var` symlink: any workspace under `$TMPDIR` / `/tmp`
fails. `acq` therefore resolves each workspace to its real, symlink-free path
(e.g. `/private/var/...`) before mounting. A directory under `$HOME` mounts
fine; prefer one over a temp dir if you hit this.

> **Why not remap under `/home/agent`?** An earlier version mounted the
> workspace under the agent home (`/home/agent/workspace`). But `msb create`
> performs the mount *before* `acq` can create the `agent` user and its
> `/home/agent` directory (that happens post-create, once the guest is
> exec-ready), so on a plain base image the mount failed with
> `mount ...: Not a directory (os error 20)`. Mounting at the
> host's own (canonicalized) absolute path avoids that ordering problem entirely
> and matches what sbx does.

### Disposable primary (`--clone`)

msb has no native clone mode, so the neutral `--clone`
([ADR-0027](adr/0027-neutral-clone-option.md); see
[CONCEPTS](CONCEPTS.md#disposable-primary---clone) for the user-facing story) is
**emulated** by the adapter:

- At create, the primary (which must be a git repository **root**) is cloned
  with `git clone --no-hardlinks` into
  `$XDG_STATE_HOME/acq/clones/<sandbox>/<repo>`, and that scratch clone is
  mounted rw **at the original workspace's absolute path** in the guest — the
  agent's starting directory and every kit behave exactly as in a non-clone
  run. `--no-hardlinks` keeps the copy physical: a same-filesystem clone would
  otherwise hardlink object files, letting the guest modify inodes shared with
  the real repo's object store.
- A `sandbox-<name>` remote is registered in the host checkout, pointing at the
  scratch dir. `git fetch sandbox-<name>` pulls agent branches back as
  hash-verified objects; hooks and config never transfer over a fetch.
- `acq rm` warns when the scratch still holds unfetched commits, then deletes
  it and removes the remote. `acq stop`/restart preserve both.

**Divergence from sbx (deliberate, per ADR-0027):** a git clone carries
committed state only. Gitignored/untracked files (sbx copies these — the known
host-build-state contamination trap) and uncommitted edits to tracked files do
**not** enter the sandbox; `acq` prints a notice when the host tree is dirty.
Commit first, or copy specific files in with `acq cp`. Two exceptions are
deliberate, both written into the scratch as repo-local config: the source
checkout's effective git identity (`user.name`/`user.email`), so a per-forge
identity kept in `.git/config` or a gitdir-scoped include still authors the
sandbox's commits; and the source's `remote.origin.url` (and `pushurl`), so
`origin` in the guest is the real remote rather than the host checkout path,
which the guest would resolve to the scratch itself. See ADR-0027 for the
rationale.

The scratch clone lives on host disk (unlike sbx's in-guest clone), confined to
the acq-managed state dir — disposable by construction and never executed by
the host's git.

Note the async-boot caveat:

> **`msb create` starts asynchronously.** `msb create` returns success even if
> the sandbox later fails to *start* (e.g. a bad mount). `acq` therefore treats
> "sandbox not exec-ready within `ACQ_MSB_EXEC_READY_TIMEOUT`" as a **hard
> provision failure** and points you at `msb logs --source system <name>` —
> rather than proceeding against a sandbox that never came up.

### Custom base image (`--image` / `ACQ_IMAGE`)

`acq` exposes one **backend-neutral** way to select a custom base image
([ADR-0022](adr/0022-neutral-image-override.md)), so the same reference works
whichever backend is active:

```bash
# flag form (run or create)
./acq run --image ghcr.io/your-org/agent-base:v1 opencode .
# env form
export ACQ_IMAGE=ghcr.io/your-org/agent-base:v1
```

**How each backend applies it:**

| Backend | Neutral image becomes | Notes |
|---------|-----------------------|-------|
| msb | the OCI image positional on `msb create` (same slot as `ACQ_MSB_IMAGE`) | msb resolves it as a **registry** reference |
| sbx | `sbx create --template <ref>` | injected only if you did **not** pass your own `--template`/`-t` |

**Precedence:** `--image` flag **>** `ACQ_IMAGE` env **>** backend var/default. If
you also set the backend-specific `ACQ_MSB_IMAGE`, the **backend var wins** (a
one-time notice is printed) — a deliberately-set backend var is never silently
overridden by the neutral knob.

**Local (registry-less) images on msb.** `msb create` pulls the image from a
registry (policy `if-missing` by default) and does **not** read the host
engine's local store, so a locally-built tag like `localhost/foo:test` fails.
Import it into msb's cache first, then disable the pull:

```bash
docker save localhost/foo:test -o /tmp/foo.tar   # or: podman save …
msb image load -i /tmp/foo.tar -t localhost/foo:test
ACQ_MSB_PULL=never ./acq --backend msb --image localhost/foo:test create shell .
```

Registry-hosted images (Docker Hub, ghcr.io, …) need no import; on sbx a local
image is imported with `sbx template load` instead (see the caveats below).

**Portable image contract.** To keep one reference usable on **both** backends,
build an image that satisfies the stricter (sbx) form of the base-image contract
([Docker Sandboxes kit reference](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/customize/kit-reference/#sandbox-block)):

- a non-root **`agent` user at UID 1000** with passwordless sudo;
- a **`/home/agent`** home owned by `agent`;
- **`HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY`** preserved across sudo;
- **`node`, `git`, `curl`, `update-ca-certificates`** present (+ `socat` for git
  signing);
- the **agent binary** baked in or installable at provision.

You do **not** have to build `FROM docker/sandbox-templates:shell` — the image
only has to *meet* the contract — but building `FROM
docker/sandbox-templates:shell` (or `shell-docker`) satisfies every point for
free. `acq`'s msb adapter is more lenient (it addresses `agent` by name and can
synthesize the user/sudo/proxy on a plain OCI base — see below), so an image that
is portable by the sbx rule always works on msb; the reverse is not guaranteed.

> **Building a derived image:** the contract sets `USER=agent`, so Dockerfile
> `RUN` steps in a derived image execute as the non-root `agent`. Writing to
> root-owned paths (e.g. `/etc`) needs `sudo` (the contract grants `agent`
> passwordless sudo) or a temporary `USER root`; prefer writing under the
> agent-owned `/home/agent`, where no elevation is required.

**sbx caveats `acq` surfaces (but cannot handle for you):**

- The **agent token must match the image's agent variant** (run `opencode`
  against an `opencode`-derived template, `shell` against a `shell` one).
- A **private or non-Docker-Hub** image needs pull creds first:
  `sbx secret set --registry <host> …`.
- A **locally-built** image (not in a registry) must be imported first:
  `sbx template load <tar>` (the tar can come from `docker save` **or** `podman
  save`).

**Registry auth.** A private image (the common case for `ghcr.io`) needs
credentials stored on the backend BEFORE `--image` can pull it:

```bash
# msb: store registry creds in the OS credential store
msb registry login ghcr.io -u <username> --password-stdin   # paste a PAT, then Ctrl-D
# sbx: the equivalent registry-credential step
sbx secret set --registry ghcr.io -u <username>
```

A public image needs none of this.

**Using a devcontainer image.** A `.devcontainer` image is a normal OCI image, so
`--image ghcr.io/org/img:tag` works — **but only if it also meets the portable
contract above.** Most devcontainer bases do **not** out of the box: they commonly
run as a `vscode` (or `node`) user rather than `agent` at UID 1000, and may lack
`socat` or the CA tooling. Two ways to reconcile:

- **On msb (lenient):** the msb adapter addresses the agent user *by name* and
  synthesizes the `agent` user / sudo / proxy contract on a plain base, and
  installs `opencode` at provision — so a devcontainer image often works as-is on
  msb provided `node`, `git`, `curl`, and `ca-certificates` are present. Missing
  tools are the usual failure; add them to the image.
- **For portability (works on sbx too):** add a thin wrapper layer that satisfies
  the contract explicitly:

  ```dockerfile
  FROM ghcr.io/your-org/your-devcontainer:tag
  USER root
  RUN command -v useradd && useradd -m -u 1000 -s /bin/bash agent || adduser -D -u 1000 agent; \
      mkdir -p /home/agent && chown agent /home/agent; \
      (apt-get update && apt-get install -y sudo git curl ca-certificates socat nodejs || \
       apk add --no-cache sudo git curl ca-certificates socat nodejs); \
      printf 'agent ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n' > /etc/sudoers.d/agent
  USER agent
  ```

  Then `--image` that wrapper. (If the devcontainer already provides a UID-1000
  sudo user and the four tools, you can skip the wrapper.)

Verify the whole path live on a sandbox-capable host with
`./scripts/verify-image-override` (builds a tiny marked image, creates a sandbox
on each installed backend with `--image`, and confirms the custom image booted).

### Base image and prerequisites

Unlike sbx (whose agent templates supply the image via a template mechanism),
the msb backend runs an OCI image directly and layers the kits on top. When no
explicit image override is set, msb derives the same sbx agent-template image
name from the requested agent (`docker/sandbox-templates:<agent>-docker`, with
`claude` → `claude-code-docker` and `cursor` → `cursor-agent-docker` as the two
product-name exceptions) and
falls back to `docker/sandbox-templates:shell-docker` if that derived image is
not found. A custom override may be any OCI image. The four pinned kits need
`node` (usai merge), `git` (playbook clone + signing), `curl`, and
`ca-certificates`/`update-ca-certificates` (zscaler) **already present in the
base image**.

These are **not** installed at runtime: the kit network rules lock egress to the
kits' own hosts (`api.gsa.usai.gov`, `github.com`, `codeload.github.com`), so a
package mirror is unreachable during provision. Docker's
`sandbox-templates:<agent>-docker` images already ship all four tools and pull
from Docker Hub without auth. Before applying kits, the adapter **verifies** the
tools are present and warns if any are missing (it does not try to install
them). A custom override must ship them too.

**The agent binary.** sbx's agent templates bake the requested agent (e.g.
`opencode`) into the image; a plain msb base has no agent. So at provision the
msb adapter **installs the agent it was asked to run**. For `opencode` this is
`npm install -g opencode-ai` (node is a verified prerequisite), and the adapter
allow-lists the npm registry host (`registry.npmjs.org`) at create so the
default-deny guest egress permits the download. The install is idempotent: it is
skipped when the binary is already present (e.g. a pre-baked `ACQ_MSB_IMAGE`) and
marker-gated against re-apply. `shell` installs nothing; an agent with no known
recipe that is also absent from the base image produces a clear warning (bake it
into `ACQ_MSB_IMAGE`). Tunables: `ACQ_MSB_OPENCODE_PKG` (npm spec, e.g.
`opencode-ai@1.2.3`), `ACQ_MSB_NPM_HOSTS` (registry host(s) to allow-list, for an
internal mirror).

**The base-image contract (Docker sandbox templates).** sbx's templates are built
on `docker/sandbox-templates:<agent>-docker`, and acq now derives the same image
name for msb when no explicit image override is set. The synthesis below exists
only for a plain-OCI **override** or fallback image: on Docker's sandbox-template
images it is a short-circuit.

#### Base image requirements

A base image for the msb backend (a custom `ACQ_MSB_IMAGE` override) must provide,
mirroring the sbx
[published base-image requirements](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/customize/kit-reference/#base-image-requirements):

- A non-root **`agent` user with passwordless sudo**. (Unlike sbx, acq does **not**
  require this user to be UID 1000 — it is addressed by name, so it works even when
  1000 is already taken, e.g. by `node` on `node:22-bookworm`.)
- A **`/home/agent`** home directory owned by `agent`.
- **HTTP proxy env** (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`) **preserved across sudo**.
- The **agent binary** (baked into the image, or installed via a kit's install
  command — for `opencode`, acq runs `npm install -g opencode-ai`).
- The four kit prerequisites present: `node`, `git`, `curl`,
  `update-ca-certificates`.

For OCI-run support (`docker run` / `docker compose`), the adapter installs
podman at provision (see [Running OCI images inside the sandbox](#running-oci-images-inside-the-sandbox-podman)),
so a base image does **not** need a container engine baked in — only a supported
package manager (apt-get/dnf/apk) and mirror reachability. Bake podman in (and
set `ACQ_MSB_ENSURE_OCI=0`) only if you want to skip the runtime install.

**Build on Docker's `sandbox-templates:*` images to get all of these for free**
— msb derives the same agent-specific image naming convention as sbx when no
explicit image override is set.

For a plain-OCI override (e.g. `node:22-bookworm`, which has `node` at uid 1000 and
no `agent`, no sudoers rule) that meets none of the first three, the msb adapter
**idempotently synthesizes** them at provision: it creates the `agent` user with
`HOME=/home/agent` (offline via `useradd`/`adduser`), chowns the staged
`/home/agent` files to it, drops a passwordless-sudo rule in `/etc/sudoers.d`, and
adds a sudoers `env_keep` for the proxy variables. It addresses the user by name
(not the literal uid 1000), so it works even when 1000 is already taken.

The recursive chown of `/home/agent` runs **only on that synthesized path**. When
the image already ships an `agent` user, acq trusts the baked ownership (a dense
baked home would otherwise cost minutes of chown on every first provision) and
touches only the home directory itself. A custom image that ships `agent` but
leaves root-owned content under `/home/agent` (a `COPY` without `--chown`)
therefore violates the contract above and is not healed: the agent user gets
`EACCES` on that subtree. Fix the image (`COPY --chown=agent:agent`, or a
`chown -R agent:agent /home/agent` layer) rather than relying on acq.

**How attach launches the agent.** sbx's `sbx run --name` re-launches the
baked-in agent. On msb the adapter reproduces that with `msb exec -t` — the one
primitive that allocates a PTY (so a full-screen agent TUI renders), runs as the
unprivileged `agent` user (`-u agent`), starts in the workspace (`-w`), forwards
the host terminal identity (`TERM`/`COLORTERM`, when set), and sets `$SHELL` to
the agent user's passwd shell (which acq sets to bash when the image ships it,
keeping `/bin/sh` otherwise). It execs the agent recorded at provision, falling
back to an interactive login shell in that same passwd shell as `agent` — never
a root shell, never msb's default interactive shell (the base image's Node
REPL) — for a `shell` sandbox or if the agent binary is somehow missing.
`acq exec` runs its command in the workspace (`-w`) too, matching sbx.

To use your own image, set `ACQ_MSB_IMAGE` to one that also provides node, git,
curl, and ca-certificates (or use the backend-neutral `--image`/`ACQ_IMAGE`, see
[Custom base image](#custom-base-image---image--acq_image)):

```bash
export ACQ_MSB_IMAGE=ghcr.io/your-org/agent-base:latest   # must have node/git/curl/ca-certificates
# ACQ_MSB_SKIP_PREREQ_CHECK=1   # optional: silence the presence check
```

If the image requires registry auth, log in with your container tooling (e.g.
`docker login ghcr.io`) before running `acq`.

### Running OCI images inside the sandbox (podman)

Agents often need to run OCI images from inside the sandbox — `docker run` an
image, or bring up a `docker-compose.yaml`. The msb adapter guarantees this
capability the same way it guarantees the base-image contract: idempotently, no
matter what the base image brings.

The default image ships the Docker CLI, but msb's microVM init (`/init.krun`)
never starts `dockerd`, so the Docker socket is dead — and Docker's `overlay2`
storage driver cannot sit on the sandbox's already-overlay root without a
disk-backed data volume. Rather than retrofit the msb docker-in-docker recipe (a
daemon to start and keep alive across restarts, plus a per-sandbox disk-backed
volume), the adapter provisions **podman** at create time and aliases `docker` →
`podman`:

- **podman is daemonless** — no socket to start/poll, no restart lifecycle — uses
  `fuse-overlayfs` on the overlay root (no disk-backed volume), and needs no
  nested virtualization (containers are `runc`/`crun` processes, not VMs).
- It runs **rootful** via the agent's passwordless sudo, which avoids the
  rootless prerequisites (`uidmap`, `passt`/pasta) a lean base lacks.
- A tiny `docker` → `podman` wrapper is placed in `/usr/local/bin` (ahead of
  `/usr/bin`), so `docker run …` **and** `docker compose …` route to podman. The
  base image's `/usr/bin/docker` is never modified. `docker compose` resolves to
  `podman compose`, driven by the installed `podman-compose` provider — so
  `docker-compose.yaml` files work. (The standalone `docker-compose` CLI is
  deprecated in favour of the `docker compose` subcommand, so no separate
  `docker-compose` binary is provided.)

The install uses the OS package mirror, which under the default balanced egress
baseline (ADR-0018) is already reachable — no extra net-rule needed. With
`ACQ_NETWORK_TIER=strict`, or a custom base whose egress is narrowed, the
mirror is unreachable and the step **fails soft** (a warning; provision
continues; OCI is simply unavailable). Turn the step off entirely with
`ACQ_MSB_ENSURE_OCI=0` (e.g. a base that bakes its own working engine), or point
`ACQ_MSB_PODMAN_PKGS` at a different package set / internal mirror. See ADR-0020.

### Secrets

Credentials are owned by **acq's backend-neutral secret store** (not sbx's).
Set a secret once with `acq secret set`; both backends read it from the same
store at provision:

```bash
./acq secret set -g usai            # prompts; stored under acq.usai
./acq secret set -g github          # prompts; stored under acq.github
./acq secret set my-sandbox usai    # sandbox-scoped; overrides the global key
```

The store lives in the host OS keychain when available (macOS `security -i`,
Linux `secret-tool`) with a `0600` file fallback under
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/acq/secrets/` when no keychain backend is available. macOS writes
use `security -i` so the value travels on stdin, not process argv. The macOS
read path uses `security find-generic-password -w`, whose output formatting can
be lossy for control characters and non-ASCII bytes even when the Keychain write
stored the bytes correctly. `acq` secrets are expected to be single-line API
tokens; do not use this store for arbitrary binary or multi-line values. Existing
legacy macOS file-backed entries are still read as a fallback until they are
re-saved or removed. Entries are keyed `acq.<service>` (global) or
`acq.<sandbox>.<service>` (sandbox-scoped); a sandbox-scoped key takes precedence
over the global one for the same service (supporting USAi per-sandbox
billing-code keys).

At `acq run`/`create`, the **msb** backend reads the value from the store,
exports it into a transient host env var, and binds it with
`msb --secret ENV@HOST`. msb puts a **placeholder** (`$MSB_<env>`) in the guest;
when the guest sends that placeholder to an allowed host over **intercepted TLS**
(`--tls-intercept`, which acq enables), msb swaps in the real value on the wire —
so the credential **never enters the guest** and **never appears in argv**.
`acq secret set` also re-feeds running sandboxes with `msb modify --secret` so a
rotated key takes effect without recreating the sandbox.

- **USAi** binds to `api.gsa.usai.gov`. The USAi provider sends the key as an
  `Authorization: Bearer` header, which msb substitutes correctly.
- **GitHub** binds to `github.com`, `api.github.com`, and
  `codeload.github.com`. msb substitutes the token on the wire for REST API calls
  and HTTPS git transport, so private GitHub tarball fetches, clones, and pushes
  can authenticate without the real token entering the guest.
- **Any other custom endpoint**: a
  service stored with `acq secret set SVC --host H --env E` records a **non-secret
  endpoint sidecar** (host + env only) in the acq store; the msb backend then binds
  it generically at provision via `--secret ENV@HOST` — no fixed usai/github table.
  `HOST` may be a comma-separated multi-host list. Absent a sidecar, a service with
  no compiled-in mapping is stored but not bound (acq tells you to supply
  `--host`/`--env`).

Feeding the **sbx** proxy depends on the sbx secret type (per the sbx CLI):

- **Built-in services** (`github`, `anthropic`, …): the value is piped to
  `sbx secret set <service>` on **stdin** (never argv). If the secret already
  exists, `acq` stops and prints the exact `sbx secret rm …` command rather than
  answering sbx's overwrite prompt.
- **Custom endpoints** (`usai` and any `--host/--env` service): `sbx secret
  set-custom` has **no stdin input** — the value would have to go on argv via
  `--value` (visible in shell history), which violates the no-argv rule. So
  `acq` stores the value in the acq store and then, from a **terminal**, runs
  `sbx secret set-custom` interactively so you enter it once at sbx's own
  prompt. When piped non-interactively (or on the msb backend), `acq` stores the
  value and prints the exact `sbx secret set-custom …` command for you to run.
  (On msb no sbx step is needed — msb reads the acq store directly.)

This is the bash subset of the design's §7.5 unified secret model; the full
Go/keychain MITM component (age fallback, `CredentialRewriteRule`,
swap-on-access placeholders) remains a larger future effort tracked separately.

> **Migration:** if you previously stored the USAi key with `sbx secret …`, run
> `acq secret set -g usai` once to move it into the acq store (the value is
> re-prompted). To pull tokens straight from your shell environment instead, run
> `acq secret import` — it scans for known service vars (`USAI_API_KEY`,
> `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN`) and stores each in the acq store
> (global by default; pass a SANDBOX to scope — a second bare token after a
> SERVICE is the SANDBOX, not a second service). It prompts before each import
> and before overwriting; `--all` imports non-interactively (skipping existing),
> `--force` (or `-f`) overwrites, and `--dry-run` previews without writing. A
> value containing a newline or tab is refused (the single-line store cannot hold
> it intact).
>
> **Overwriting:** `acq secret set` is non-destructive toward sbx — if sbx
> already holds the secret it stops with an `sbx secret rm …` hint rather than
> silently replacing it. The acq store copy is always updated.

### Host ssh-agent forwarding (git signing)

The `git-ssh-sign` kit signs guest commits with the **host's** SSH agent, so no
private key material ever enters the sandbox. On msb this is **automatic whenever
the host `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` env var is set** (the same opt-in signal sbx uses): at
create, acq forwards the host agent socket into the guest with
`--vsock $SSH_AUTH_SOCK:3552/stream`, then starts an in-guest `socat` bridge that
re-exposes the vsock route as a unix socket at `/home/agent/.acq/ssh-agent.sock`
and exports it as `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` on attach, `acq exec`, and kit commands.

- **Needs msb >= 0.6.9** (the release that adds `--vsock`) **and `socat` in the
  base image** (the default `docker/sandbox-templates:shell-docker` ships it). On
  an older msb, or a guest without `socat`, acq **warns and skips** the forward
  (fail-soft) — the 0.6.8 floor is unchanged.
- **It widens the host↔microVM trust boundary:** guest code can exercise every
  key the host agent holds while the socket is reachable. It is **opt-in** via
  `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` — **unset it to disable** — and only agent *operations* (not key
  material) traverse the socket. Where your agent supports it, use `ssh-add -c` /
  `ssh-add -h` to constrain use. Because a set `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is the *only*
  trigger, acq prints a **one-time startup notice** (on both backends) when the
  forward is active — naming the `unset SSH_AUTH_SOCK` opt-out and the `ssh-add -c`
  mitigation — so the forward is a conscious choice, never silent.
- **Live end-to-end verified** on a macOS/HVF host (2026-08-17) via
  `scripts/verify-backends`: the guest's forwarded agent exposes the verifier's
  hermetic throwaway key over the `--vsock` + socat path. It cannot run in CI or
  inside a sandbox (no nested sandboxes); re-run on the ADR-0011 cadence.

See [ADR-0021](adr/0021-msb-host-ssh-agent-forwarding-via-vsock.md) for the full
rationale, the fixed vsock port (3552), and the trust-boundary discussion.

### Historical limitations (msb)

- **Private GitHub repos previously had to use the REST API, not `git clone`.**
  Older msb releases substituted an injected credential for the REST API host
  (`api.github.com`) but not for git's smart-HTTP transport to `github.com` /
  `codeload.github.com`. That was the origin of the private-repo `git clone`
  limitation and the earlier REST-tarball workaround.

  **Resolution:** current acq binds
  `GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com,api.github.com,codeload.github.com` on msb. Store a
  token with `acq secret set -g github` (or `gh auth token | acq secret set -g
  github`); absent a token the kit degrades gracefully (warns, no rules/skills).
  Kits still may use REST tarballs for reproducibility, but HTTPS git clone/push
  is no longer intentionally excluded from secret substitution. Older msb builds
  may still show the historical limitation, so use `scripts/verify-backends` to
  confirm the live git-transport and codeload paths on a sandbox-capable host.

### Capability flags

| Flag | Value | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| `ACQ_BACKEND_SUPPORTS_PORT_FORWARD` | 1 | Post-hoc `acq ports <sandbox> --publish HOST:GUEST` is **implemented**: `acq_backend_ports` opens `msb ssh serve` on an ephemeral loopback port against a running sandbox and tunnels the guest port to the host with OpenSSH `-L` (no re-create), using an acq-managed ed25519 key and tearing the serve/ssh pair down on `acq stop`/`rm` ([ADR-0015](adr/0015-msb-post-hoc-port-publish-via-ssh.md)). Create/run publish via neutral `publishedPorts` → `-p HOST:GUEST` also ships. **Live-verified** on a KVM-capable host via `scripts/verify-ports-live` (happy-path publish + host-reaches-guest, LIST, fail-closed on a busy host port, teardown) |
| `ACQ_BACKEND_SUPPORTS_SNAPSHOTS` | 0 | msb has a full `msb snapshot` CLI verb, but `acq` exposes **no `snapshot` verb** to invoke it. Wiring one is beyond sbx parity (sbx has none), so the flag reflects what `acq` surfaces (`0`), not what msb can do |
| `ACQ_BACKEND_CAN_RESUME` | 1 | `msb stop` / `msb start` preserve state |
| `ACQ_BACKEND_SUPPORTS_CREDENTIAL_REWRITE` | 1 | `--secret ENV@HOST` + `--tls-intercept` (host-scoped substitution for REST/API hosts and HTTPS git transport hosts) |

### Differences from sbx

| Feature | sbx | msb |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Isolation | Container (microVM) | microVM (libkrun) |
| Kit format | Neutral `hybrid/v1` → sbx-v2 (synthesized) | Neutral `hybrid/v1` → `msb` operations |
| Zscaler CA | file-drop + `update-ca-certificates` | native `--trust-host-cas` shortcut |
| Secret model | proxy `secret set-custom` | host-env `--secret ENV@HOST` |
| Git commit signing / ssh-agent | host SSH agent forwarded implicitly by the sbx CLI (when SSH_AUTH_SOCK set) | host SSH agent forwarded via `--vsock` + an in-guest socat bridge when SSH_AUTH_SOCK set, msb >= 0.6.9 (ADR-0021) |
| Secret binding breadth | 7 built-in services + any custom `--host/--env` endpoint | usai + github + **any** custom `--host/--env` endpoint bound generically via `--secret ENV@HOST` (shipped) |
| Snapshots | not supported (`SUPPORTS_SNAPSHOTS=0`) | `msb snapshot` verb exists but **not surfaced by `acq`** (beyond-parity; `SUPPORTS_SNAPSHOTS=0`) |
| Port forwarding | `acq ports` (post-hoc) | create/run (`-p`) via neutral `publishedPorts` now (shipped); **plus** post-hoc `acq ports --publish` via `msb ssh serve` + `ssh -L` now implemented (ADR-0015) — live end-to-end verification pending a KVM host |
| Kit volumes | neutral `volumes:` passed through 1:1 to kit-spec v2 §5.7 (sized block device / tmpfs, mounted at create; dies with the sandbox) | neutral `volumes:` unioned across kits (last wins by path) and mapped to a derived named disk volume (`--mount-named acq-<sandbox>-<pathslug>-<crc>:<path>:kind=disk,size=<size>`) or `--tmpfs <path>:<size>`; derived volumes removed on `acq rm` (ADR-0023) |
| Agent binary | supplied by the sbx agent template | installed at provision on a plain base (`npm install -g opencode-ai`), then launched on attach |
| OpenCode web UI | `openchamber` acq kit (publishes port 4096) | same kit once it declares `backends: [sbx, msb]` against the released patterns schema (neutral port/background vocab consumed by both backends; the patterns repo's openchamber kit) |
| In-place kit heal | `sbx kit add` (state-preserving, 0.35.0+; **no startup-bearing kits on 0.38+ — recreate to extend/refresh**) | re-apply kits idempotently (no state-preserving add) |

### Known limitations

- **Ports: create/run publish shipped; post-hoc implemented (live e2e pending).**
  Kits declare ports in the **neutral top-level `publishedPorts`** vocabulary
  (`{guest, host?, protocol?, name?}`), which both backends now consume — on msb
  each entry maps to a create/run-time `-p HOST:GUEST`
  ([ADR-0014](adr/0014-neutral-port-publish-and-background-vocab.md), shipped
  on `feat/msb-parity`). The legacy sbx-only `backend_extras.sbx.publishedPorts`
  block still works for one release with a deprecation warning. The neutral
  fields are read *defensively* (absence is a silent no-op); with the released
  patterns schema + openchamber kit (both merged) they now light up
  end-to-end — the openchamber kit declares
  `publishedPorts`/`background` neutrally and both backends consume it.
  A **post-hoc** path is now **implemented**:
  `acq --backend msb ports <sandbox> --publish HOST:GUEST` runs `msb ssh serve`
  on an ephemeral loopback port against a running sandbox and tunnels the guest
  port to the host over OpenSSH `-L` with no re-create, using an acq-managed
  ed25519 key (never the user's `~/.ssh`) and tearing the serve/ssh pair down on
  `acq stop`/`rm`
  ([ADR-0015](adr/0015-msb-post-hoc-port-publish-via-ssh.md)); this
  is what flips `SUPPORTS_PORT_FORWARD=1`. **Live end-to-end verification is
  still pending** — the real forward needs a KVM-capable host, so run
  `scripts/verify-backends` on such a host per the ADR-0011 periodic-validation
  cadence (see the live end-to-end note below) before treating it as verified
  working. (`msb -p` also accepts `BIND_ADDR:HOST:GUEST` and `/udp`, but acq
  stays TCP + loopback for sbx parity.)
  **Loopback-only guest services need the post-hoc path or a wider bind.** The
  host-side bind for `-p HOST:GUEST` is loopback by default, but the msb publisher
  connects to the sandbox's guest network IP, not to guest `127.0.0.1`. A service
  bound only to `127.0.0.1:GUEST` inside the sandbox can therefore answer
  `acq exec <sandbox> -- curl http://127.0.0.1:GUEST` while host-side
  `curl http://127.0.0.1:HOST` connects and then fails with `Empty reply from
  server` / browser `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE`. Bind the service to `0.0.0.0:GUEST` (or
  the guest interface address) for create-time `publishedPorts`, or use
  `acq --backend msb ports <sandbox> --publish HOST:GUEST`; the post-hoc path
  tunnels with `ssh -L` from inside the guest and can reach guest loopback.
- **No state-preserving in-place kit add.** `acq_backend_ensure_kits_applied`
  re-applies kits idempotently; for a clean rebuild use `acq rm && acq run`.
- **`acq` can auto-install only `opencode` on msb.** On the msb base image `acq`
  installs the agent at provision time, and today only `opencode` has an install
  recipe (`shell` needs no binary). Any other agent must be pre-baked into your
  own `ACQ_MSB_IMAGE`; `acq` warns at attach if the requested agent has no recipe.
  (On sbx the agent is supplied by the sbx template, so this constraint is
  msb-specific.)
- **Snapshots not surfaced.** `msb snapshot` is a full CLI verb, but `acq`
  exposes no `snapshot` verb, so `SUPPORTS_SNAPSHOTS=0`. Wiring it is beyond sbx
  parity (sbx has no snapshots), so the flag reflects what `acq` surfaces rather
  than the verb being built.
- **Browser-based OpenCode is via the `openchamber` kit.** The former
  `opencode-web.sh` helper has been removed; use the `openchamber` acq kit, which
  publishes the OpenCode server port (4096) plus the OpenChamber UI (3000) with a
  supervised lifecycle. The neutral port/background vocabulary is consumed by
  both backends (ADR-0014), and the openchamber kit has been republished against
  the released patterns schema to declare `backends: [sbx, msb]` (merged);
  the browser-OpenCode path is now covered on msb, not just sbx.

## ppp Backend (Phase 3, in development)

The Podman-Plus-Proxy (ppp) backend is being developed in
[GSA-TTS/ppp](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/ppp) and is targeted for Phase 3 — it
is not part of this release. When it lands, it will implement the same adapter
contract ([ADR-0010](adr/0010-acq-pluggable-backends.md)) and consume the same
neutral `hybrid/v1` kits via `kit-translate.sh`, so adding it is additive (a new
`acq.backends/ppp.sh` + a detection branch), with no change to the sbx or msb
paths. See `docs/explorations/acq-design.md` §"ppp" for the intended mapping.

---

## Backend resolution order

`acq` resolves the backend in this priority order (highest wins):

1. `--backend <name>` flag (per-invocation override)
2. `ACQ_BACKEND` environment variable
3. `backend:` key in `~/.config/acq/config.yaml`
4. Auto-detect: first installed backend (`msb` preferred, then `sbx`)

If multiple backends are installed and none is explicitly selected, `acq`
auto-detects in the order above (msb wins when both are present). Use
`--backend`, `ACQ_BACKEND`, or `acq backend set` to pick sbx explicitly.

---

## Troubleshooting

Set `ACQ_DEBUG=1` to trace backend CLI invocations and kit fetch/translate
steps to stderr (no secret values are printed):

```bash
ACQ_DEBUG=1 ./acq --backend msb create shell /path/to/project
```

`scripts/verify-backends` supports `-v`/`--verbose` (stream every acq command
and its output live) and `-k`/`--keep` (leave a failing sandbox up for manual
inspection):

```bash
./scripts/verify-backends -v
```

A `WARN` line marks a known, tracked limitation — it is surfaced every run but
does **not** count as a failure, so a clean run still exits 0. (The former msb
private-repo playbook `WARN` is gone: the playbook kit now fetches via the REST
API and is a hard-required `pass` on both backends, given a stored github token.)

**msb: broad egress failure on an established setup.** If an msb sandbox that
used to work starts failing *every* outbound call at once (USAi, GitHub, and npm
all cut with `curl (56) unexpected eof` / HTTP `000`), the likeliest cause is
corrupted local msb state, not a network or certificate change. Wipe msb's data
and reinstall, then confirm host readiness:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.microsandbox.dev | sh   # reinstall (re-lays runtime state)
msb doctor                                          # verify virtualization + prerequisites
msb doctor --fix                                    # apply supported setup fixes
```

If a broad cut persists on a clean reinstall — or if only USAi fails (a
split-horizon-DNS symptom) — see
[`docs/KNOWN_FAILURE_MODES.md` §30](KNOWN_FAILURE_MODES.md) for the three-signature
triage and the `scripts/diagnose-*` probes.

---

## Adding a new backend (implementer notes)

1. Create `acq.backends/<name>.sh` implementing the contract in
   [ADR-0010 §"Adapter contract"](adr/0010-acq-pluggable-backends.md).
2. Set the capability flags at the top of the file.
3. Implement all required `acq_backend_*` functions. Consume the neutral
   `hybrid/v1` kits via `acq.backends/kit-translate.sh` (parse the spec, honor
   `backend_shortcuts.<name>`, then emit your backend's native operations).
4. Add auto-detect to `_auto_detect_backend` in `acq.backends/common.sh`.
5. Add the backend to `acq backend list` and `acq_print_doctor`.
6. Write tests in `test/bats/*.bats` (stub the CLI via the
   `scripts/test-acq-lib.sh` stub layer) and a row in `scripts/verify-backends`.
7. Document it here.

---

## Kits: the neutral hybrid/v1 vocabulary

Kits are authored once in the neutral `hybrid/v1` spec (in the patterns repo
under `integrations/isolation/acq-kits/`) and translated per backend by
`acq.backends/kit-translate.sh`:

- **sbx** — the neutral spec is synthesized into an sbx-v2 kit directory
  (`spec.yaml` + `files/`), then applied via `sbx --kit` / `sbx kit add`. The
  synthesizer maps neutral fields onto the strict sbx-v2 grammar
  (`permissions.network`, `setup`, `ports`, and `agentInstructions`).
- **msb** — the neutral spec is fetched and driven directly: network allows
  become `--net-rule` flags, files are `msb copy`'d in, and `commands` run via
  `msb exec`. A `backend_shortcuts.msb` (e.g. zscaler `trust_host_cas`) uses the
  native primitive instead.

The neutral vocabulary is: `caps.network.allow`, `files[]`, `commands[]`,
`environment`, `publishedPorts`, `volumes`, `agentContext`,
`backend_shortcuts`, and `backend_extras`.

**`environment` (guest env vars).** A flat map of `NAME → value` for
**non-secret** guest environment variables (e.g. `OPENCODE_CONFIG`,
`OPENCODE_TUI_CONFIG`, `GITLAB_HOST`). Names must be POSIX identifiers
(`^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$`; an invalid name is dropped with a warning and
reported by `acq kit validate`); values are plain strings. It maps to sbx-v2
`environment.variables` (synthesized) and to `msb exec -e NAME=value` (per-exec).
**Secrets do NOT go here** — use the credential/secret path (`acq secret …`);
the kit spec never carries a secret value.

**acq-set guest variables.** Independently of any kit, acq sets two guest
environment variables at create on both backends, through the backend's native
create-time env flag (`msb create --env`, `sbx create --env`), so they are
present in every exec/attach session and survive a native restart:

| Variable | When | Value |
|----------|------|-------|
| `ACQ_WORKSPACE` | any create with a workspace | guest path of the **primary** (first) workspace's mount root. Not necessarily the agent's cwd: on msb, `ACQ_MSB_WORKSPACE` moves only the start dir, and the marker stays on the primary mount so a `--clone` kit always writes into the clone |
| `ACQ_CLONE` | `--clone` / `ACQ_CLONE=1` only | `1` — the primary is a disposable clone ([ADR-0027](adr/0027-neutral-clone-option.md)) |

They are the kit-facing contract for "act on the clone, never on the real
checkout": a startup step that writes agent instructions or a repo-local
permission gate into the workspace should key on them rather than on a
mount-type heuristic (the msb emulation mounts the scratch exactly like a
passthrough, so `findmnt`-style probes cannot tell the two apart):

```sh
[ "${ACQ_CLONE:-0}" = 1 ] && ws="$ACQ_WORKSPACE"
```

The guard fails closed on both backends. `ACQ_WORKSPACE` is absent on a
workspace-less create; `ACQ_CLONE` is never set to any value but `1`.

**`volumes` (sized guest storage, [ADR-0023](adr/0023-neutral-volumes-kit-vocabulary.md)).**
A top-level list of `{path, type?, size}` entries — `path` required, absolute,
and normalized (no `.`/`..` segments, no `//`, no trailing `/` — a volume
mounts a whole filesystem, so `/.` would shadow the guest root), `type` empty
(block-backed, the default) or `tmpfs`, `size` required
and non-zero, in the portable byte-size grammar (`20G`, `512m`, `1.5G` — no
`b`/`ib` suffixes like `256MB`/`2gib`; msb's parser rejects those even though
sbx accepts them). Volumes are **creation-time only** and mount **at boot,
before any exec is possible**, so storage layout never races startup commands
or early agent use; a mid-life `acq kit apply` warns that it cannot attach
them. Multiple kits union by path, last wins, on both backends. On sbx entries
pass through 1:1 to the kit-spec v2 §5.7 `volumes` block (a dedicated ext4
block device of the declared size); on msb a block entry becomes a derived
named disk volume (`acq-<sandbox>-<pathslug>-<crc>`, removed again on
`acq rm`) and a tmpfs entry becomes `--tmpfs`. Invalid entries are dropped
with a warning and reported by `acq kit validate`. Don't declare tiny block
volumes: msb refuses ext4 disk images below a minimum size (128M on msb
0.6.12, "image size is too small for ext4 formatting") — treat ~256m as a
practical floor (`acq kit validate` warns below it).

> **Kit-authoring caveat: volumes mount UNSEEDED (both backends).** The mount
> is an empty filesystem that shadows any image content at the path. A kit that

> ships its own first-boot copy step; the shadowed content stays reachable

> `mount --bind / /mnt/rootfs`, then copy from `/mnt/rootfs/<path>`).

Manage kits with `acq kit list | validate PATH | apply NAME KITREF`.

### Kit-bundle provenance and stale-sandbox refresh

`acq` records, host-side, which built-in bundle ref each sandbox was built from
(under `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/acq/provenance/<backend>/<name>.env`;
override with `ACQ_PROVENANCE_DIR`). It compares that against the **local**
`PATTERNS_KIT_REF` to detect drift:

- `acq kit check SANDBOX` — report `current` / `stale` / `unknown` (read-only).
- `acq kit update SANDBOX [--yes]` — reapply the bundle in place to the pinned
  ref, preserving sandbox state. `--yes` is honored **only** on this explicit
  command.
- `acq run` on an existing sandbox that is behind the pin **offers** a refresh:
  interactive, default No, EOF declines, and it **never blocks** a launch. A
  non-interactive run prints one advisory and continues.
- Opt out with `ACQ_UPDATE_CHECK=0` or `acq run --no-update-check`.

Backend behavior: **sbx** injects any absent built-in kits during the heal pass;
**msb** re-applies all built-in kits idempotently. Both rewrite provenance only
after a successful apply. Staleness is an exact-ref mismatch against the local
pin (no git ancestry, no network) — the local checkout is the source of truth.
See [ADR-0016](adr/0016-kit-bundle-provenance-and-stale-refresh.md).

## Shipped

- `acq kit apply|list|validate` — kit management subcommands
- Neutral `hybrid/v1` kit spec + `kit-translate.sh` (multi-backend kits)
- `msb` (microsandbox) backend, with agent install/launch on a plain base image
- Backend-neutral USAi key rotation ([ADR-0012](adr/0012-backend-neutral-key-rotation.md))
- Per-sandbox GitHub token downscoping ([ADR-0013](adr/0013-per-sandbox-github-token-downscoping.md))
- sbx port-publish carry + `--kit <ref>` interception
- Neutral top-level `publishedPorts` + `background` vocab consumed by **both**
  backends (msb maps to create/run `-p HOST:GUEST`; background startup commands
  run detached), with a deprecated `backend_extras.sbx.publishedPorts` fallback
  ([ADR-0014](adr/0014-neutral-port-publish-and-background-vocab.md)) — the
  neutral fields light up end-to-end with the released patterns schema +
  openchamber kit (merged)
- msb `SUPPORTS_SNAPSHOTS=0` — `acq` surfaces no snapshot verb (msb's own verb
  exists; wiring is beyond parity)
- Generic custom-endpoint secret binding on msb — usai + github + **any** custom
  `--host/--env` endpoint bound via `--secret ENV@HOST` from a non-secret endpoint
  sidecar
- Post-hoc port publish on msb — `acq ports <sandbox> --publish HOST:GUEST`
  via `msb ssh serve` + OpenSSH `-L` against a running sandbox (acq-managed ed25519
  key, serve/ssh teardown on `acq stop`/`rm`); flips `SUPPORTS_PORT_FORWARD=1`
  ([ADR-0015](adr/0015-msb-post-hoc-port-publish-via-ssh.md)). **Implemented,
  not yet live-verified** — live end-to-end run needs a KVM host per the ADR-0011
  `scripts/verify-backends` cadence
- Neutral top-level `volumes` vocab consumed by **both** backends (sbx: 1:1
  into kit-spec v2 §5.7; msb: derived named disk volume / `--tmpfs`, with
  derived-volume cleanup on `acq rm`)
  ([ADR-0023](adr/0023-neutral-volumes-kit-vocabulary.md)). **Live-verified on
  both backends** (`verify-backends`: msb 0.6.12 macOS HVF 17/17 — dedicated
  virtio-blk mount at boot + derived-volume removal on rm; sbx 0.39.0 9/9 —
  dedicated block-device mount of the declared size); the patterns schema
  property is still pending, so the field is read defensively (absence a no-op)

## Shipped later

- `acq kit check|update` + host-side kit-bundle provenance and stale-sandbox
  refresh (see ADR-0016)
- Removal of the deprecated `qsbx` wrapper (3.0.0)

## Still deferred

- Live end-to-end verification of msb **post-hoc port publish**
  (`acq ports --publish` via `msb ssh serve` + `ssh -L`) on a KVM-capable host —
  code is implemented and the review's liveness fix landed, but the real
  forward has not yet been exercised end-to-end (`scripts/verify-backends` covers
  the kit/agent/USAi rows, not `--publish`), so run it per the
  [ADR-0011](adr/0011-msb-backend-and-neutral-kits.md) periodic-validation
  cadence before treating the tunnel as verified working
- `acq snapshot` verb (beyond sbx parity; msb's own `msb snapshot` verb is not
  surfaced)
- Full Go/keychain swap-on-access secret component of design §7.5 (age fallback,
  `CredentialRewriteRule`); acq ships the bash keychain subset (see Secrets)
- `acq policy …` — network policy subcommands
- `ppp` (Podman-Plus-Proxy) backend — Phase 3, in development at
  [GSA-TTS/ppp](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/ppp)
- Advisory "your Quickstart checkout is behind origin" check
