# Agent Communication Protocol

`scode` speaks the **Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)** natively, in two
transports that share a single handler chain.

## Transports

```bash
# stdio — for editors, IDE plugins, and CLI orchestrators
scode acp

# WebSocket + embedded Web UI — for browsers and service backends
scode acp serve --port 8080
```

`scode acp serve --port 8080` exposes:

- JSON-RPC over WebSocket at `ws://localhost:8080/ws`
- An interactive Web UI at `http://localhost:8080/`

Both transports share streaming, tool use, elicitation, and permission
prompting.

## Use cases

- **Editor plugins (Zed, VS Code, JetBrains)** speak ACP over stdio.
- **Web apps and dashboards** connect to the WebSocket endpoint or point
  a browser at `/` to use the embedded UI.
- **Automation pipelines and microservices** run `scode acp serve` as a
  long-lived process behind a load balancer.
- **Sub-agents and orchestrators** fan out work to multiple `scode`
  instances over the wire.

## Binding

For local-only use, bind to `127.0.0.1`. For team access, expose the port
behind your own auth proxy.

## Sessions

One `scode acp` process serves **many sessions**. Requests are ordered per
session and independent across sessions:

- Requests on the **same** session (`session/prompt`, `session/setModel`,
  `session/setPermissionMode`, `session/close`) run strictly one at a time,
  in arrival order. Two prompts sent to one session never interleave.
- Requests on **different** sessions run concurrently. In particular, a
  session that is waiting on the user — a pending `session/request_permission`
  or `_scode/ask_user_question` — does not hold up `session/new` or prompts
  on any other session.
- `session/cancel` is never queued; it reaches a session mid-turn.
- Sessions in the same working directory run fully in parallel. Because tool
  execution is anchored to the *process* working directory, turns of sessions
  in **different** directories share that directory cooperatively: a turn
  waits for turns in another directory to finish or to pause on user input
  before it starts, and a paused turn gives the directory back while it waits.

### Per-session system prompt (`_meta.sudocode.*`)

`session/new` and `session/load` accept two optional, orthogonal keys under
the request's `_meta.sudocode` object. Both are plain strings, passed to the
model verbatim — no truncation, no escaping, no size cap beyond the model's
own context window, and no policy about who may use which: that is the
caller's (e.g. a multi-tenant service's) decision.

```json
{
  "cwd": "/work/tenant-a",
  "mcpServers": [],
  "_meta": {
    "sudocode": {
      "systemPrompt": "You are Tenant A's release bot. ...",
      "appendSystemPrompt": "House rules: never push to main. ..."
    }
  }
}
```

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `systemPrompt` | **Override.** Replaces the built-in static system-prompt blocks (the `You are Sudo Code…` identity, `# System`, `# Working`, `# Risky actions`, `# Tools`, `# Git`) with this text as the single static block. |
| `appendSystemPrompt` | **Append.** Added as the last **static** block, after the built-in identity and behaviour blocks and before every dynamic block (environment / project context, `AGENTS.md` instructions, runtime-config summary, auto-memory, plugin inventory, skill listing). A caller preamble is stable for the life of the session, so it belongs in the aggressively cached prefix; the cost is that the workspace-derived dynamic blocks now follow it rather than precede it. |

The two compose: set both and the static blocks are replaced *and* the
extra block is appended after the replacement, still inside the static
prefix. Workspace-derived dynamic blocks (environment,
`AGENTS.md`, memory) are always kept, so an overridden prompt still knows
which directory it is operating in.

Rules:

- A present key must be a non-empty string; an empty/whitespace string or a
  non-string value is rejected with `invalid_params` (`-32602`) rather than
  silently ignored.
- The values are bound to the session for its whole lifetime — a
  `session/setModel` rebuilds the runtime with them re-applied. They are
  **not** persisted with the transcript; a client that wants them on a
  resumed session passes them again on `session/load`.
- They layer on top of the process-wide `--system-prompt` /
  `--append-system-prompt` CLI flags of the `scode acp` process, if any:
  a session `systemPrompt` replaces whatever the process default static
  block is, and a session `appendSystemPrompt` is appended after the
  process-level append.
- The `initialize` response advertises `_meta.sudocode.systemPromptOverride:
  true` and `_meta.sudocode.systemPromptAppend: true` so clients can
  feature-detect.

### Per-session memory (`_meta.sudocode.memory`)

`session/new` and `session/load` accept an optional `memory` key under
`_meta.sudocode` that decides whether **this one session** uses the
persistent memory system (`~/.scode/projects/<slug>/memory/`, or wherever
`SUDOCODE_MEMORY_DIR` points).

```json
{
  "cwd": "/work/tenant-a",
  "mcpServers": [],
  "_meta": {
    "sudocode": {
      "memory": "disabled"
    }
  }
}
```

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| *(key absent)* | **The default.** Memory behaves exactly as it always has — the auto-memory block is part of the system prompt and the model may write entries. A client that never sends the key sees no change. |
| `"enabled"` | The explicit spelling of the default. |
| `"disabled"` | This session neither reads nor writes memory: no auto-memory block in its system prompt (so the model is never told the memory directory exists), and the standing permission to write under that directory is not granted. |

Rules:

- **Session-scoped, not process- or user-scoped.** One `scode acp` process
  serves many sessions and each carries its own mode: session A can remember
  while session B, in the same process and the same directory, does not.
- **Disabling stands memory down; it never deletes.** Nothing under the
  memory directory is read, written, moved or removed — a disabled session
  does not even create the directory. Open a later session without the key
  (or with `"enabled"`) and the same entries are back.
- The mode is bound to the session for its whole lifetime: a
  `session/setModel`, an automatic compaction or any other runtime rebuild
  re-applies it. Like the system-prompt keys it is **not** persisted with the
  transcript — a client that wants a resumed session to stay memory-less
  passes the key again on `session/load`.
- A value outside `"enabled"` / `"disabled"`, or a non-string value, is
  rejected with `invalid_params` (`-32602`) rather than silently ignored.
  Trimming aside, matching is exact and case-sensitive: `"off"`, `"Disabled"`
  and `false` are all errors. Silently defaulting a mistyped value to
  "enabled" would leave memory on while the caller believed it off, which is
  the one failure this key must not have.
- Sub-agents a turn spawns keep their own per-agent-type memory
  (`agent-memory/<type>/`, a different directory) and are **not** covered by
  this key today.
- The `initialize` response advertises `_meta.sudocode.sessionMemory: true`
  so clients can feature-detect.

### Slash commands

A `session/prompt` whose text starts with `/` is a slash command, not a model
turn: it runs on the session's lane like any prompt, streams its result as
`agent_message_chunk` text, and completes with `stopReason: "end_turn"` and
no `usage`. The ACP agent implements a fixed subset of the REPL commands:

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/help` | List the commands in this table (the REPL-only ones are not shown). |
| `/status` | Model, usage, git and config status for this session. |
| `/cost` | Cumulative token usage for this session. |
| `/model [<model-id>]` | Show the current model, or switch this session to another model. |
| `/compact` | Summarise older messages to free context. A validated LLM checkpoint; failures preserve the original history and return an error. No token threshold — an explicit request always compacts when there is anything beyond the preserved recent tail. The compacted transcript is persisted immediately. The reply reports the method used, messages removed / kept, and the estimated token count before and after. The original transcript is archived before replacement. |
| `/config [section]` | Show the effective configuration (read-only; `/config set` is REPL-only). |
| `/diff` | Staged and unstaged git changes in the session directory. |
| `/doctor` | Local health checks for auth, config and workspace. |

Any other `/command` is answered with a one-line text hint naming the command
and listing this table.

**Discovery.** Right after a successful `session/new` or `session/load`
response, the agent sends one `session/update` notification advertising the
table, so clients can build a command palette without hard-coding it:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "session/update",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "…",
    "update": {
      "sessionUpdate": "available_commands_update",
      "availableCommands": [
        { "name": "compact", "description": "Summarise older messages to free context (validated LLM checkpoint)" },
        { "name": "model", "description": "…", "input": { "hint": "<model-id>" } }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Names carry no leading slash; send them as `/name …` in `session/prompt`.
`input.hint` is present only for commands that take arguments. The
notification follows the response on the same connection, so the client
already knows the session id when it arrives; be ready to receive
`session/update` for a session as soon as its `session/new` response is in,
because this one follows immediately. The same table drives `/help` and the
unknown-command hint, so the three never disagree.

`session/cancel` applies to `/compact`: a cancel during the model round-trip
drops the call, a cancel that lands after it discards the result; either way
the transcript in memory and on disk is left untouched and the prompt ends
with `stopReason: "cancelled"`. The other commands are local and complete
before a cancel could matter.

**Automatic compaction.** When a turn compacts the transcript on its own —
either the pre-turn overflow guard or the in-turn threshold path — the
`session/prompt` response carries `_meta.sudocode.autoCompacted: true`
alongside the existing `contextWindowTokens`, `estimatedSessionTokens`,
cost and `cumulativeUsage` fields. The key is absent when no automatic
compaction happened; `/compact` itself never sets it (its report is the
text reply). Like the rest of `_meta.sudocode`, it rides on the success
response, so a turn that fails after compacting reports the error and no
`autoCompacted`.

The policy borrows rolling checkpoints, token-priced retention and prune-first
pressure handling from [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/c291e7961a515f6d7af9304e7fd1d257929aef26/docs/subsystems/compaction.md).
Sudo Code retains its model-specific output reservation and pressure buffer.

Compaction stages changes before replacing the live transcript. An empty,
truncated, or non-shrinking summary is rejected. Failure before or during a
turn stops the pending model request with history intact; failure of optional
post-turn compaction keeps the completed answer and warns. No automatic
local-statistics fallback is used. The next request cannot proceed when its
history still exceeds the context budget.

Automatic pressure first trims oversized tool text (over 8,192 Unicode code
points) to a 4,096-point head and 1,024-point tail plus a marker. ToolSearch
results are exempt because their JSON also enables deferred tool schemas.
If trimming suffices, no summary call is made. Otherwise the same checkpoint
pipeline as manual compaction runs. A checkpoint rewrites prior summaries
with newer history instead of concatenating them. Recent retention is token
priced: at most 16% of the model window, capped at half the available history
budget and one fifth of current history, with a four-message minimum and
complete tool exchanges taking precedence. File contents are not re-read and
re-injected after compaction.

Main-agent and subagent clients use the same non-streaming text transport in
`api::ProviderClient::complete_text`. Client adapters select only their model
and tool schemas; runtime owns compaction prompts, retry policy and validation.
The shared transport also owns message conversion and cache hints.

Both LLM paths request at most 8,192 output tokens (or the model's smaller
limit). The preferred path reuses the system prompt, tool schemas and older
message prefix; the fallback strips thinking and replaces images with text
placeholders. Neither path drops the oldest input to recover from overflow.
Transient failures are retried with bounded backoff.

On successful replacement, `<transcript>.before-compact-<timestamp>` retains
the original JSONL snapshot through the same filesystem backend. These
snapshots are not listed as independent sessions and are not automatically
pruned. The current transcript is replaced atomically before memory changes;
a subsequent load therefore sees the committed checkpoint. This is snapshot
preservation, not a new event-sourced session format.

### `session/load`

`agentCapabilities.loadSession` is advertised. `session/load
{sessionId, cwd, mcpServers}` re-opens a session persisted by an earlier
process from `<cwd>/.scode/sessions/<workspace-fingerprint>/<sessionId>.jsonl`
and the next `session/prompt` continues the conversation with the full prior
transcript (user turns, assistant turns, thinking, tool calls and tool
results) sent to the model.

What is restored is the **transcript**: message history, the session's model,
compaction state and fork lineage. What is not: in-memory turn state such as
a permission mode set through `session/setPermissionMode` (the loaded session
starts from the configured default again), per-turn "allow always" answers,
running background commands, and MCP servers other than the ones passed in
the `session/load` request.

`cwd` must be the directory the session was created in — a session's store
is keyed by its workspace and the persisted `workspace_root` is validated on
load, so loading a session id from another directory is rejected. Continuing
a conversation in a new directory is a fork, not a load — see `forkFrom`
below. `session/load` does not currently replay the history to the client as
`session/update` notifications; the client is expected to keep its own copy
of the conversation.

### Forking a conversation (`session/new` + `_meta.sudocode.forkFrom`)

A client that branches a conversation — "continue from here in a new
session" — creates the branch with `session/new` and names the source under
`_meta.sudocode.forkFrom`. The new session starts as a **copy of the source's
transcript** (messages, compaction state, model, prompt history), gets a
fresh id, records the source as its parent, and is persisted under the new
`cwd`'s own session store, so it is a first-class session there (later
`session/load {cwd}` of it works). The source is read, never modified.

```json
{
  "cwd": "/home/user/session-b",
  "mcpServers": [],
  "_meta": {
    "sudocode": {
      "forkFrom": { "sessionId": "session-1788512053256-0", "cwd": "/home/user/session-a" }
    }
  }
}
```

`forkFrom` takes `sessionId` and/or `cwd`:

| Given | Source |
|---|---|
| `sessionId` only | A session **open in this process**. Rejected (`invalid_params`) if it is not — after a restart pass `cwd` as well. |
| `sessionId` + `cwd` | The session persisted under `cwd`'s store, validated against its recorded workspace root exactly like `session/load`; an open session of that id must live in `cwd`. |
| `cwd` only | The most recently updated session persisted under `cwd`. Useful for a client that keeps one directory per conversation and does not track scode's session ids. |

An open source is copied from memory when it is idle; mid-turn (a turn holds
the session for its duration) the persisted transcript is copied instead,
which carries every completed message. Offloaded tool results referenced from
the transcript are copied alongside it. The copy is the whole transcript —
there is no point-in-time cut yet.

`forkFrom` composes with `systemPrompt` / `appendSystemPrompt` on the same
request; a present-but-malformed `forkFrom` (not an object, neither field,
empty strings) is `invalid_params`. The `initialize` response advertises
`_meta.sudocode.sessionFork: true` so clients can feature-detect. Older
agents ignore the key and start an empty session, which is the behaviour
the flag lets a client avoid relying on.
