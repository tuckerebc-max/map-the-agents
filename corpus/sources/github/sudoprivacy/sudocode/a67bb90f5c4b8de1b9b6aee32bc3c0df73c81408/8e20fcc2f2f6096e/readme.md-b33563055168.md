## FOR HACKERS.

**Built because Claude Code chose non-coders.**

There was a time when Claude Code was a real coding agent —
opinionated, fast, debuggable. The pivot toward onboarding the 99%
changed that: hidden options because "users might misclick", forced
auto-updates overriding pinned versions, new surface shipping while
core surface stayed broken, heavy-user issues going unanswered.

Sudo Code is what happens when a heavy user gives up asking and
starts building.

Rust-native CLI. Inline only — never hijacks your terminal.
Pipe-composable — works with your shell, doesn't replace it.
Model-agnostic — your subscription, your choice. Open source — your
fork, your call.

## Who this is for

| FOR | NOT FOR |
|---|---|
| The 1% by daily agent token-burn | First-time coders looking for tutorials |
| Engineers who live in `tmux`, `ssh`, `vscode terminal` | Anyone who wants a GUI |
| Engineers the system, not the steps — roles, DoD, reviewers; scales 1 → 10 → 100 agents | Drives one agent at a time, prompt by prompt |
| Wants the process fully exposed — "reading `src/auth.rs:42-89`" not "reading file" — to scan-and-catch | Wants the agent to handle details and surface only the result |
| Owns the stack they run — pinned versions, readable sessions, forks when needed | Runs whatever the vendor pushes next |

Every row is a productivity differentiator, not a status one. The
left column pushes productivity further by **engineering the
interaction**; the right column saves cognitive load by **trusting
the tool**. Sudo Code optimizes the first axis — which is why we
expose full process by default. Not for staring. For scan-and-catch
when something is off, and zero ceremony when it's not.

The end-state of this workflow is one heavy user shipping at the
productivity of a small team. The arc looks like **1 session →
7-10 parallel sessions → copilot-worker fleets of 100+ agents**.
At stage 1 you drive one agent. At stage 2 you parallelise long
unattended tasks — until mental bandwidth caps around ten. At
stage 3 a copilot agent reviews worker agents; you supervise the
copilot, the copilot does the per-agent direction, and the fleet
scales past anything one person could track. Sudo Code is the
agent unit at every stage. The collaboration plane that makes
stage 3 real is described in
[Position in the larger picture](#position-in-the-larger-picture)
below.

If the right column is you, this isn't your tool — and that's not a
problem to solve. **Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot are excellent
for the 99%; use those.** Sudo Code is opinionated against the right
column on purpose. We don't ship modes that bridge the gap, and we
don't apologize for that.

---

## Design principles

Two columns: what we'll always do, what we'll never do. These aren't
aspirations — they're constraints that shape every PR.

### Always

| | |
|---|---|
| **Open source. MIT. Forever.** | No secret-sauce room, no "real enterprise tier behind a wall". |
| **Model-agnostic.** | Your subscription, your key, your proxy. We bind to no vendor. |
| **Headless first-class.** | What you see in REPL is what runs as a service — same binary, same surface. |
| **Local-first.** | Zero telemetry by default. Your prompts don't leave your machine unless you tell them to. |
| **Inline only.** | Your terminal stays yours. Scrollback, tmux, ssh, vscode terminal — all preserved. |
| **Sole goal: heavy-user productivity.** | Every design decision filters through "does this compress wall-clock between a heavy user's thought and outcome?" If not, it doesn't ship. Comfort, onboarding, compatibility for the 99% — explicitly not our problem. |
| **Stable surface. No silent updates.** | Semver. Breaking change = major bump + release notes. You pin a version, that version stays. |
| **Everything is file.** | Config in `.scode.json`. Sessions in jsonl. Plugins on the filesystem. Future state on the [nexus VFS](https://github.com/nexi-lab/nexus) — every secret, stream, agent, audit trace addressable through `sys_read` / `sys_write`. No opaque DBs. No sibling APIs hiding state. |
| **Session is yours.** | jsonl you can read, fork, replay, `awk` through. Zero lock-in. |
| **Dogfood non-negotiable.** | The team burns this binary daily. No-dogfood, no release. |
| **Polish before scope.** | New surface doesn't ship while existing surface is broken. Scope expansion is an admission of failure on the core, not an upgrade. |

### Never

| | |
|---|---|
| **Closed source.** | No proprietary fork. The repo you see is everything. |
| **Force auto-update.** | You pin, you stay. Forced silent updates is one of the reasons sudocode exists. |
| **Premium features behind a paywall.** | One binary. No free/pro split. |
| **Alternate-screen TUI.** | Never hijack your screen. Inline ANSI only. No `ratatui`, no split-pane, no `--tui` flag. |
| **In-CLI multi-agent dashboard.** | We're a unit. Dashboards belong in sudowork / your tmux / your IDE. |
| **Vendor lock.** | No proprietary model API. No proprietary protocol — ACP is open. |
| **Telemetry by default.** | Opt-in is explicit. Not buried in EULA clause 47. |
| **CLA / copyright assignment.** | Contributors keep their copyright. Commit directly. |
| **Pivot away from hackers.** | If we ever do, **we fork ourselves**. |
| **"Some users might misclick" as a reason.** | Hidden options behind config because the 99% might fumble = treating us like the 99%. We're not. Either ship a feature, or don't. |

---

## Position in the larger picture

**Sudo Code is a unit, not a hub.** It plugs into a larger
collaboration plane through one shared primitive: the `chat-with-me`
mailbox on the [nexus VFS](https://github.com/nexi-lab/nexus).
Orchestration, multi-agent UI, fleet management — none of that is
our job. Sudo Code is the well-behaved agent unit that other
surfaces can drive: a human in a [sudowork](https://sudowork.sudoprivacy.com)
chat, a [hydra](https://github.com/sudoprivacy/hydra)-style
orchestrator, another sudocode running as copilot, a peer agent like
Claude or Codex on ACP. Same primitive, same plane.

### Topology — sudocode is one box among peers

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Orch["Orchestrator — NOT sudocode<br/>(sudowork main · hydra UI)"]
      O["ManagedAgentService<br/>start_session_v1 · cancel · get_session"]
    end

    subgraph Units["Agent units — sudocode is one of these"]
      direction TB
      H["👤 human"]
      SC["scode pid<br/>copilot OR worker role"]
      CL["claude pid (via ACP)"]
      CX["codex pid (via ACP)"]
    end

    subgraph Plane["nexus VFS plane"]
      MB["chat-with-me DT_STREAMs<br/>/agents/{name}/chat-with-me<br/>/proc/{pid}/chat-with-me<br/><br/>sys_watch + sys_write<br/>kernel stamps 'from' field"]
    end

    O -. spawn .-> SC
    O -. spawn .-> CL
    O -. spawn .-> CX

    H <--> MB
    SC <--> MB
    CL <--> MB
    CX <--> MB
```

Sudo Code is interchangeable with `claude` / `codex` / a human at the
mailbox primitive. It does not sit in the orchestrator box.

### One binary, three deployment modes

Same `scode` binary is a copilot, a worker, or a standalone CLI —
chosen by which `FsBackend` impl the runtime routes through:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Runtime["sudocode runtime (Rust)"]
      direction LR
      SES["SessionStore"]
      CFG["ConfigLoader"]
      FOPS["file_ops helpers"]
    end

    TRAIT["FsBackend trait<br/>(one trait · three impls)"]

    SES --> TRAIT
    CFG --> TRAIT
    FOPS --> TRAIT

    TRAIT --> B1["StdFsBackend<br/>host std::fs"]
    TRAIT --> B2["NexusVfsFsBackend<br/>gRPC → remote kernel"]
    TRAIT --> B3["KernelFsBackend&lt;Kernel&gt;<br/>in-process syscalls"]

    B1 -.deployed in.-> M1["standalone CLI<br/>(scode on hacker's laptop)"]
    B2 -.deployed in.-> M2["edge / dev CLI<br/>(scode → remote nexus)"]
    B3 -.deployed in.-> M3["sudocode-host binary<br/>(prod managed agent)"]
```

### Hydra evolution

[Hydra](https://github.com/sudoprivacy/hydra) — today a TypeScript
VS Code extension shelling out to tmux + git worktrees to spawn
Claude / Gemini / Codex — gets thin once `sudocode-host` lands:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Today["Today — hydra is a hack on system tools"]
      direction TB
      T1["VS Code extension<br/>(TypeScript)"]
      T2["tmux pane persistence"]
      T3["git worktree isolation"]
      T4["spawned claude / gemini / codex<br/>via shell"]
      T1 --> T2 --> T3 --> T4
    end

    subgraph Future["After sudocode-on-nexus-vfs ships"]
      direction TB
      F1["VS Code sidebar<br/>(thin — UI only)"]
      F2["ManagedAgentService<br/>start_session_v1()"]
      F3["WorkspaceBoundaryHook<br/>(VFS-enforced isolation)"]
      F4["scode / claude / codex<br/>as agent units"]
      F5["chat-with-me DT_STREAM<br/>(persistence + raft replication)"]
      F1 --> F2 --> F3 --> F4 --> F5
    end

    Today ==>|"hydra internals rewritten, becomes thin"| Future
```

Sudo Code is the agent unit underneath that whole future picture.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sudoprivacy/sudocode/main/install.sh | sh
```

`install.sh` downloads the prebuilt `scode` binary for the host
platform (macOS arm64/x64, Linux x64/arm64) and verifies a SHA-256
checksum. On macOS Apple Silicon: `/opt/homebrew/bin`. On macOS x64
and Linux: `/usr/local/bin`, prompting for `sudo` only when stdin is
a TTY. When the preferred system directory is unwritable and `sudo`
is unavailable, the script installs to `$HOME/.local/bin`. Windows
users grab the zip from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/sudoprivacy/sudocode/releases/latest).

Overrides:

- `SCODE_VERSION=v0.1.5 sh install.sh` — pin a specific release.
- `sh install.sh --no-sudo` — install to `$HOME/.local/bin`.
- `SCODE_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin sh install.sh` — explicit per-user install.
- `sh install.sh --prefix /usr/local` — explicit prefix.

China mirror (checksums still verified against GitHub):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://sudowork-release-1309794936.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/sudocode/release/latest/install.sh | \
  SCODE_MIRROR=https://sudowork-release-1309794936.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/sudocode/release/latest sh
```

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sudoprivacy/sudocode.git
cd sudocode/rust
cargo build --release
# Binary at ./target/release/scode
```

Requires a recent stable Rust 2021 toolchain.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Pick an auth mode (see docs/authentication.md)
export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN="sk-ant-oat-..."

# Interactive REPL
scode

# One-shot prompt — pipe-composable, like every unix tool
scode "explain this codebase" | bat
scode "list failing tests" --output-format json | jq '.tests[]'

# Read a plan from stdin, resume a prior session
cat plan.md | scode --resume <session-id>

# Headless ACP server for editors / web clients
scode acp serve --port 8080

# Health check
scode doctor
```
