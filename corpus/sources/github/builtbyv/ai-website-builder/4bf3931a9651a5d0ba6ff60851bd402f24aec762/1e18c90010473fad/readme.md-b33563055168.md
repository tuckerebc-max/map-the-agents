# AI Website Builder 🤖

Build your website by just talking to AI in your own language — no coding required!

## 🎯 What is this?

This is a website template that lets you build and update your site by having conversations with AI assistants. Just describe what you want in your own language, and watch your website come to life!

### Choose Your AI Assistant:
- **Claude Code** - AI coding agent by Anthropic
- **OpenAI Codex CLI** - AI coding agent by OpenAI  
- **Google Gemini CLI** - AI coding agent by Google (FREE tier available!)

All understand natural language and can build your website — pick any one!

### Perfect for:
- Small business owners who need a professional website
- Freelancers building their portfolio
- Anyone who wants a website without learning to code
- People who think in ideas, not in HTML

## ✨ What Can You Build?

Just tell your AI assistant what you want:
- "I need a website for my coffee shop"
- "Add photos of our menu items"
- "Make it easy for people to find our location"
- "I want customers to book tables online"
- "Make it look warm and inviting"

Your AI understands and does the technical work for you!

## 🚀 Getting Started (It's Really Simple!)

### 🧠 Easiest Way: Install the Skill

If you already use **Claude Code**, **Codex CLI**, **Gemini CLI**, **Cursor**, **VS Code Copilot**, or any AI coding tool — just install the skill. No cloning, no setup scripts. One command and your AI knows how to build websites.

**One-line install** — installs automatically to `~/.claude/skills/ai-website-builder/`, and also to `~/.agents/skills/ai-website-builder/` if that folder already exists (Codex CLI, Cursor, Copilot, etc.):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/builtbyV/ai-website-builder/main/skill/install.sh | bash
```

**Using a different tool?** Create the skills dir first so the installer picks it up, then re-run the command:

| Tool | Skills dir to create |
|------|---------------------|
| Codex CLI / Cursor / Copilot | `mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills` |
| Gemini CLI | `mkdir -p ~/.gemini/skills` then `mv ~/.claude/skills/ai-website-builder ~/.gemini/skills/` |
| Project-local (any tool) | Copy `~/.claude/skills/ai-website-builder` into `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, or `.cursor/skills/` inside your project |

**Using Claude Desktop or Claude.ai instead?** Upload as a ZIP:

1. [**Download ai-website-builder-skill.zip**](https://github.com/builtbyV/ai-website-builder/releases/latest/download/ai-website-builder-skill.zip)
2. In Claude.ai → **Customize** → **Skills** → **+** → **Upload a skill**
3. Select the ZIP and toggle it on

The skill is fully self-contained — it includes the starter template, publish scripts, style guides, and all the instructions your AI needs to build websites.

Prefer the manual way? Continue reading below for terminal instructions.

### Manual Setup Instructions

#### What You Need:
- A computer with internet
- Node.js ([Download here](https://nodejs.org) - installs like any app)
- Git (Windows: [Download here](https://git-scm.com); Mac/Linux: usually pre-installed)
- 10 minutes to set up
- That's it! (You'll create a free hosting account when ready to publish)

**Or use our launcher scripts above — they'll check and guide you through installing anything missing!**

#### Opening Terminal

Terminal is an app that lets you type commands.

**On Mac:**
1. Press `Command ⌘ + Space`
2. Type **Terminal**
3. Press **Enter**

**On Windows:**
1. Install Git for Windows from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) if you haven't already
2. Right-click on your desktop or in a folder
3. Select **"Git Bash Here"**

**On Linux:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`
Or search for "Terminal" in your applications

You'll see a window with text and a blinking cursor — this is where you'll type commands!

#### Three Simple Steps:

#### 1. Get the Website Template

Run these commands one at a time in Terminal:

**First** - Copy the template to your computer:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/builtbyV/ai-website-builder.git
```
Press Enter and wait until the download finishes.

💡 **Tip:** You'll know it's finished when you see your Terminal prompt (`$` or similar) again.

**Then** - Go into your project folder:
```bash
cd ai-website-builder
```
Press Enter.

**💡 Troubleshooting:**
- If you see 'No such file or directory', the download probably isn't complete yet. Wait a bit and try again.
- You should see `ai-website-builder` in your Terminal prompt after this command

#### 2. Install AI Assistants

In your Terminal window (make sure you're inside the `ai-website-builder` folder), run this command:
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

💡 **Don't worry if you see lots of text scrolling by—this is normal! Just wait until it stops and you see your Terminal prompt again.**

This command automatically does everything for you:
- ✅ Check your computer is ready
- ✅ Install Claude Code and/or OpenAI Codex CLI and/or Gemini CLI
- ✅ Set everything up for you
- ✅ Give you a quick reference guide

## 💻 Helpful Terminal Commands

Just a few commands you might need:

- `cd folder-name` - Go into a folder
- `cd ..` - Go back up one folder  
- `ls` - See what's in current folder (works in Git Bash on Windows too)
- `pwd` - See where you are

**Examples:**

Enter your project folder:
```bash
cd ai-website-builder
```

Go back to the previous folder:
```bash
cd ..
```

See what files are in current folder:
```bash
ls
```

Check which folder you're in:
```bash
pwd
```

### Stopping Running Processes:
- **Windows/Linux**: Press `Ctrl + C` to stop any running command
- **Mac**: Press `Command + C` to stop any running command
- This is useful when you need to stop the preview server or AI assistant

#### 3. Start Building!

Choose your AI assistant and run one of these commands:

**For Claude Code:**
```bash
npx claude
```

**For OpenAI Codex:**
```bash
npx codex
```

**For Gemini CLI:**
```bash
npx gemini
```

**What this does:** Starts your AI assistant so you can chat directly in the Terminal.

That's it! Now just tell your AI assistant what you want:
- "Hi Claude, I want to build a website for my bakery"
- "Can you make the header include our logo?"
- "Add a section showing our daily specials"

💡 **Remember:** If you make a mistake, just tell your AI assistant to undo it - nothing will break!

## 💬 Your First Conversation

Here's what a real conversation looks like:

**You:** "Hi, can you help me understand this website project?"

**AI:** "I'll analyze your project... This is a modern website template with a blue design. You have a homepage with navigation, hero section, features, pricing, and testimonials. Would you like me to explain any specific part?"

**You:** "I want to change it to a pizza restaurant website"

**AI:** "I'll help you transform this into a pizza restaurant website! Let me update the content and styling. I'll change the hero section, update the navigation, and adjust the color scheme to be more appetizing. Should I proceed?"

**You:** "Yes please!"

*The AI then makes all the changes and shows you what was updated*

## 🎨 Common Things People Ask Their AI Assistant

## 📱 See Your Changes Instantly

You'll need two Terminal windows - one for your website preview, another for chatting with AI.

### Why Two Windows?
- **Window 1**: Keeps your website running so you can see it
- **Window 2**: Where you chat with your AI assistant

### How to Open a Second Terminal:

**On Mac:**
1. In Terminal, press `Command ⌘ + N`

**On Windows (Git Bash):**
1. Right-click in a folder and select "Git Bash Here" again

**On Linux:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + N` in most terminals
Or open a new Terminal from your applications

Click between windows to switch.

### Terminal 1 - Website Preview:

Run this command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

💡 **Tip:** Keep this window open! It needs to stay running for your preview to work.

**What this does:** This starts your website preview. After running it, open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to see your website!

### Terminal 2 - AI Assistant:

**First** - Go to your project folder:
```bash
cd ai-website-builder
```

**Then** - Start your AI assistant:
```bash
npx claude
```
(Or use `npx codex` or `npx gemini` instead)

Now you can chat with your AI in Terminal 2 and see changes instantly in your browser!

## 🌐 Making Your Website Live

When you're happy with your website, just tell your AI:
- "I want to publish my website"
- "Make this live on the internet"
- "Help me share this with customers"

Your AI assistant will:
- Ask for your confirmation
- Make sure everything looks good
- Publish it to the internet
- Give you a public link you can share

## 🌐 Free Website Hosting Options

Your website can be hosted for FREE on any of these platforms:

- **GitHub Pages**: `https://[username].github.io/[project]/`
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Fast global CDN
- **Netlify**: Easy custom domains  
- **Vercel**: Great for modern apps

When you're ready to publish, just tell your AI assistant "I want to publish my website" and it will:
- Ask which platform you prefer
- Guide you through creating a free account (if needed)
- Publish your site automatically
- Give you your live website URL!

**No credit card required for any of these services!**

### Creating Another Website:

Want to build another website? Here's how:

**Tip:** Each website is completely independent. You can have multiple websites in different folders and work on them separately!

**Step 1** - Go back to your main folder:
```bash
cd ..
```

**Step 2** - Copy the template again with a new name (this creates a separate folder for your new website):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/builtbyV/ai-website-builder.git my-new-site
```

**Step 3** - Enter your new project:
```bash
cd my-new-site
```

**Step 4** - Run setup:
```bash
bash setup.sh
```
