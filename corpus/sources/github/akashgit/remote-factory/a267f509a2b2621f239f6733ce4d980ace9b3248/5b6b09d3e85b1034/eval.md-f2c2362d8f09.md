# Eval System

re:factory uses a three-tier composite scoring system to measure every change objectively. No change is kept without a measured improvement.

## Three Tiers

### Tier 1: Hygiene (6 dimensions)

Auto-detected from project tooling. These measure basic code quality:

| Dimension | What it checks | How |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| `tests` | Test suite passes | Runs detected test command |
| `lint` | No lint errors | Runs detected linter (ruff, eslint, etc.) |
| `type_check` | Type checking passes | Runs mypy, pyright, tsc, etc. |
| `coverage` | Test coverage level | Parses coverage reports |
| `config_parser` | `factory.md` is valid | Validates configuration |

Implementation: `factory/eval/hygiene.py`

### Tier 2: Growth (5 dimensions)

Computed by re:factory itself. These measure whether the project is actually evolving:

| Dimension | What it measures | Weight |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| `capability_surface` | Modules, public functions, entry points | 0.28 |
| `experiment_diversity` | Variety of hypothesis categories attempted | 0.22 |
| `observability` | Logging, error handling, monitoring | 0.20 |
| `research_grounding` | Changes informed by research (archive, papers) | 0.16 |
| `factory_effectiveness` | Keep rate, score trajectory | 0.14 |

Implementation: `factory/eval/growth.py`

### Tier 3: Project Eval (user-defined)

Custom dimensions for domain-specific metrics. Defined in `factory.md`:

```markdown
## Project Eval
- name: benchmark_accuracy
  command: python eval/benchmark.py
  parse: json
  weight: 0.6
  timeout: 300
- name: inference_latency
  command: python eval/latency.py
  parse: exit_code
  weight: 0.4
```

Each command must output either:
- **json**: `{"score": 0.0-1.0}` to stdout (optionally `{"score": 0.85, "details": "..."}`)
- **exit_code**: Exit 0 for pass (score 1.0), non-zero for fail (score 0.0)

## Weight Distribution

| Scenario | Hygiene | Growth | Project |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| No project eval (default) | 50% | 50% | — |
| With project eval (default) | 30% | 20% | 50% |
| Custom (via `## Eval Weights`) | Configurable | Configurable | Configurable |

Configure in `factory.md`:

```markdown
## Eval Weights
- hygiene: 0.25
- growth: 0.25
- project: 0.50
```

## Scoring

The composite score is computed by `factory/eval/scorer.py`:

1. Each dimension produces a score (0.0 to 1.0) and a weight
2. Within each tier, scores are weighted and normalized
3. Tiers are combined using the weight distribution above
4. Guard violations force the composite to fail regardless of score
5. The threshold (default 0.8) determines keep/revert

## Guards

Guard rules are inviolable constraints checked via `factory/eval/guards.py`:

- **Scope guard**: Changes must be within `## Scope / Modifiable` patterns
- **Eval immutability**: The eval system itself cannot be modified by experiments

Guard failures override eval scores — a failing guard means mandatory revert.

## Precheck Gate

`factory precheck` runs 4 non-overridable checks before any keep/revert decision:

1. **Score direction** — score must not regress and must meet threshold
2. **Scope** — guard check must pass
3. **Anti-pattern** — hypothesis must not be >60% similar to a previously reverted one
4. **Smoke test** — if configured in `factory.md`, the smoke test command must pass

The CEO cannot override a failed precheck.

```bash
factory precheck ~/my-project \
    --score-before 0.7 \
    --score-after 0.85 \
    --hypothesis "add structured logging" \
    --baseline abc123
```

## Research Mode Interaction

In research mode, the eval system works differently. The **research target metric** is the primary signal — hygiene scores serve as a hard gate but don't drive the keep/revert decision.

### Decision hierarchy

1. **Hygiene gate** — any regression in tests, lint, or type_check forces an automatic revert, regardless of metric improvement
2. **Monotonic improvement** — the research target metric must be `>= previous_best`. If the metric regresses below the highest value achieved in any prior run, the experiment is reverted. The metric ratchets forward — it can never go backward.
3. **Leakage guard** — if ground truth contamination is detected, the experiment is reverted
4. **Precheck** — standard precheck (scope, anti-pattern, smoke test) still applies

### Leakage guards for fixed surfaces

Research mode defines **fixed surfaces** — ground truth data, eval scripts, and test fixtures that must never be modified or leaked into hypotheses. Three layers of protection:

| Guard | What it detects | Risk level |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| **Token overlap** | Distinctive tokens from fixed surfaces appearing in hypothesis/diff text (Jaccard similarity) | low–medium |
| **Negation hints** | Patterns like "do NOT use X" where X appears in ground truth — encoding answers by exclusion | high |
| **Specific values** | Numeric literals or quoted strings extracted from fixed surfaces appearing in hypothesis text | medium |

Leakage checks run at three hard gates:

1. **Strategy review** — CEO scans each hypothesis before approving
2. **Builder review** — CEO scans the PR diff after implementation
3. **Precheck** — automated guard check before keep/revert

A medium or high leakage risk triggers an automatic redirect (at Strategy/Builder) or revert (at Precheck).

### Monotonic improvement policy

The research target metric must satisfy `metric_after >= previous_best` for every accepted experiment. This prevents:

- Oscillation between local optima
- Aggregate regression from individually plausible changes
- "Two steps forward, one step back" patterns

If a change improves the metric on some instances but regresses on others, the aggregate must still be at or above the previous best. The CEO cannot override a monotonic improvement violation.

## Adversarial Eval Loops

For projects that pit two components against each other (e.g., a generator creating test cases vs. a discriminator catching them), re:factory supports GAN-style adversarial eval loops as a first-class pattern.

Unlike the standard three-tier eval, adversarial loops use **two separate eval commands** — one per component — and alternate between them. Each side has its own threshold, and the loop switches focus when one side consistently exceeds its target.

### How it works

1. The **generator** starts as the active phase
2. Each round runs the active component's eval command and records the score
3. When a component scores at or above its threshold for N consecutive rounds (hysteresis), the loop switches to the other component
4. Per-role streak counters freeze when inactive — the generator's counter doesn't change during discriminator rounds
5. **Convergence** is declared when both components independently sustain above-threshold performance for `convergence_window` consecutive rounds

### Relationship to standard eval

Adversarial eval loops run alongside (not instead of) the standard three-tier eval system. The standard hygiene/growth/project eval still gates keep/revert decisions. The adversarial loop provides an additional signal about which component to focus improvement efforts on.

### Configuration

Configure in `factory.md` with dot-notation. See [Configuration — Adversarial](configuration.md#adversarial) for the full reference.

### CLI

```bash
factory adversarial-state /path/to/project           # View phase, streaks, history
factory adversarial-state /path/to/project --reset    # Reset to defaults
```

Implementation: `factory/adversarial.py`. State persisted at `.factory/adversarial_state.json`.

## Running Evals

```bash
# Full eval (all three tiers)
factory eval ~/my-project

# Skip project-specific eval (hygiene + growth only)
factory eval ~/my-project --skip-project-eval

# Check guards only
factory guard ~/my-project --baseline <sha>
```
