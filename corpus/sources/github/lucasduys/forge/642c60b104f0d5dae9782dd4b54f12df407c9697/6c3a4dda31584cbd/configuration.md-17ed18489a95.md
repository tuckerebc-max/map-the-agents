## Platform Support

Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL and Git Bash). Pure JavaScript (CommonJS) + Bash. No native dependencies, no build step.

Cross-platform quirks:
- Windows Git Bash has higher process startup overhead (~80ms bash + ~100ms node). Hook performance floors are documented in `hooks/token-monitor.sh`.
- File locking is advisory on all platforms (presence of lock file + heartbeat freshness, not `flock`).
- Atomic writes use temp-file-rename pattern with EBUSY retry on Windows.
