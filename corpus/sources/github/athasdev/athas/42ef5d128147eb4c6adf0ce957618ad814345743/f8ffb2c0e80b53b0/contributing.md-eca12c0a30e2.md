# Contributing to Athas

Thank you for contributing to Athas! Please check existing issues and pull requests before creating new ones.

## Setup

See [setup guides](https://athas.dev/docs/contributing) for your platform.

Prerequisites:

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- [Node.js 24.19.0](https://nodejs.org)

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

## Before Submitting

1. Code passes checks: `bun check`
2. Auto-fix issues: `bun fix`
3. Formatting only when needed: `bun format`
4. App runs: `bun dev`
5. Run release validation when touching release flow: `bun release:check`
6. Rebase on master: `git rebase origin/master`
7. Squash commits into logical units
8. Review and agree to the
   [Contributor License and Feedback Agreement](CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AND_FEEDBACK_AGREEMENT.md)

## Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style
- Use descriptive commit messages (i.e., "Add autocompletion")
- One logical change per commit
- Update documentation if needed

## Rust Tests

- Keep small unit tests in a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block beside the code they exercise.
- Move a large unit-test suite to `src/<module>/tests.rs` and declare it with
  `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;` from the owning module.
- Use `crates/<crate>/tests/` for integration tests that exercise the crate through its public API.
- Add focused regression tests for behavior changes and bug fixes instead of targeting a coverage
  percentage.
- Run one crate or test while iterating with `cargo test -p <crate> <test-name>`, then run
  `bun check:rust` before submitting Rust changes.
