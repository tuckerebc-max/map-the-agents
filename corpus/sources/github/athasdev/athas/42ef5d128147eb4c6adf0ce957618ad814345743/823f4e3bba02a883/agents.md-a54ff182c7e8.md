## Project Overview

- Athas is a desktop code editor built with Tauri, React, TypeScript, and Rust.
- Frontend feature code lives under `src/features/`.
- Shared frontend code lives under `src/components`, `src/hooks`, and `src/utils`.
- Extension-specific code lives under `src/extensions/`.
- Rust feature logic should prefer `crates/[feature]`; keep `src-tauri` focused on app wiring and integration.

## Setup And Validation

- Always use Bun for repo scripts and package management.
- Required environment: Bun `1.3.2`, Node.js `22+`, and Rust.
- Install dependencies with `bun install`.
- Start the app with `bun dev`.
- Use `bun smoke alpha` or `bun smoke prod` for quick local smoke tests of packaged app launches.
- Run full checks with `bun check`.
- Run tests with `bunx vp test run`.
- Run TypeScript checks with `bun typecheck`.
- Run Rust checks with `bun check:rust` when touching Rust code.
- When touching release flow, validate locally with `bun scripts/release.ts <bump> --dry-run` before anything else, then run `bun release:check`.

## Workflow Rules

- Never change `AGENTS.md` unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not prefix unused variables with an underscore; delete them instead.
- Do not use emojis in commit messages, logs, or documentation.
- When adding a broadly useful user-facing action, add or update its command-palette entry; do not mirror low-level or context-only controls.
- Validate the relevant checks after making changes instead of stopping at code edits.

## Branches And Releases

- Default to working directly on `main`.
- If a branch is needed, branch from `main`.
- Keep branch names short and descriptive.
- Keep releases and release tags on `main`.

## Commits

- Keep commits focused. One logical change per commit.
- Commit titles should be short, direct, and describe the outcome of the change.
- Start commit messages with an uppercase letter.
- Every commit must include a short wrapped body in plain language.
- Wrap commit body lines before the commitlint line-length limit instead of leaving warnings behind.
- Commit bodies should explain what changed and why without headings, boilerplate, or filler.
- When useful, end the commit message with a separate `Fixes ...` or `Closes ...` line.
- Avoid prefixes, filler, hype, and changelog-style noise in commit messages.
- Never leave commitlint or message-format warnings unresolved.
- Before creating a commit, run the checks that match the change.
- When editing commit text that includes code, multiline content, or shell-sensitive characters, prefer a file-based edit over inline shell text.

## Code Style

- Follow existing code style and keep changes aligned with nearby code.
- Use kebab-case for file and folder names by default.
- React component files, hook files, and utility files should use descriptive kebab-case names such as `settings-dialog.tsx`, `use-keymaps.ts`, or `theme-loader.ts`.
- Import React hooks directly and call them by name, such as `useEffect(...)`, instead of qualifying hooks through the React namespace.
- Avoid new vague filenames such as `helpers.ts`, `misc.ts`, or `utils.ts` when the file can be named after what it actually does.
- Avoid unnecessary comments in UI components; prefer self-explanatory code.
- Avoid unnecessary `cn(...)` calls; use it only for conditional or merged class names.
- Use Tailwind utilities for normal component styling.
- Keep app-wide CSS in `src/styles/` for base reset, fonts, scrollbars, theme tokens, shared syntax tokens, and platform/window overrides only.
- Keep feature CSS next to the feature and import it from the owning component entrypoint; use it only for generated markup, third-party DOM, editor layers, or selectors Tailwind cannot express clearly.
- Prefer `src/ui` primitives and CVA variants for reusable UI styling instead of feature-specific wrapper classes or new global CSS selectors.
- Do not add exported Tailwind class string constants such as `*_CLASS_NAME`; use CVA variants or UI primitives for reusable styling.
- Use CSS variables for theme colors; do not hardcode hex values in UI code.
- Keep font size, font family, theme colors, keymaps, and shortcuts in their existing system-level homes instead of redefining them ad hoc in feature components.
- Never use hardcoded font-size utilities such as `text-[11px]` in UI code; use the shared UI font-size classes such as `ui-text-sm`, `ui-text-base`, and related system primitives instead.
- Interactive elements must remain accessible, including accessible names for icon-only controls and usable keyboard/focus behavior.

## UI Design System

- Treat `src/ui` primitives and `src/styles/theme.css` as the source of truth for reusable visual behavior.
- Do not create `src/ui/tests` or add tests for UI primitives that only assert rendering, class names, data slots, variants, or upstream Base UI/Shadcn behavior. Test product behavior in the owning feature instead unless the user explicitly requests a primitive-level regression test.
- Before creating UI markup or a new component, search `src/ui` and at least two comparable feature surfaces for an existing primitive or composition.
- Feature components may control placement, responsive layout, and domain content. They must not redefine a shared primitive's height, radius, border, background, typography, or interaction states with local utility classes.
- When a primitive is missing a needed visual behavior, add a named semantic prop or CVA variant to the primitive and migrate every current consumer that represents the same pattern.
- Do not create pass-through wrappers, exported Tailwind class constants, or feature-local copies of shared controls. Keep a wrapper only when it owns behavior or a stable composition reused by multiple consumers.
- If the same visual utility sequence appears in two feature consumers, move that contract into a shared primitive before finishing the change.
- New app-wide visual concepts require semantic variables in `src/styles/theme.css`, derived from the existing theme colors when possible. Do not add feature-local color mixes or hardcoded light/dark values.
- Prefer spacing and surface contrast over borders. Borders should communicate a real boundary and should be owned by the primitive rather than added independently by consumers.
- Keep `className` escape hatches focused on layout and placement. Repeated visual overrides are evidence that the primitive API needs a semantic variant.
- When touching a shared primitive, audit all import sites and remove confirmed dead or redundant code in that primitive's module.
- Before finishing UI work, verify light and dark themes plus hover, active, focus-visible, disabled, overflow, and resized states in the real Tauri app when practical.

## Icons

- Three registries, three sets of rules. `src/ui/icons.tsx` owns UI icons: one outline drawing per product concept, tinted with `currentColor`. `src/ui/brand-marks.tsx` owns third-party marks, which keep their own artwork and stay out of the stroke system. Icon themes under `src/extensions/icon-themes/` own file-type art, which the user can replace.
- `src/ui/icons.tsx` is the only module allowed to import `nucleo-ui-outline-18`. Add a new icon by exporting it there, never by reaching into the library from a feature.
- One concept, one name, one drawing. Two exports must never wrap the same Nucleo drawing, and an export's name must describe what it draws. Import icons under their own name; `import { XIcon as Close }` splits one concept back into two vocabularies.
- Icons carry no stroke decisions at the call site. Stroke lives in `src/styles/icons.css`, pinned to real pixels with `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke` so it does not drift when the UI font size scales the 18px drawing grid. Choose weight with the `optical` prop only: `sm` (1.25px) up to 20px, `md` (1.5px) to 28px, `lg` (2px) above that. A numeric `size` picks the tier on its own.
- Pin a concept in `src/ui/icon-concepts.ts` when it shows up in more than one feature and more than one glyph would be defensible. Two concepts must never resolve to the same icon.
- Use line chevrons for disclosure, expansion, submenu, and directional navigation controls. Reserve triangular play icons for actions that actually start or resume something.
- Prefer sizing icons by inheritance (the default `1em`) so they track the UI font size. Reach for an explicit `size` only when the icon is not sitting next to text.
- `src/features/settings/tests/ui-icon-contract.test.ts` enforces the structural half of these rules. Run it after touching the icon layer.

## Zustand

- New React Zustand stores should use the shared `createSelectors` helper.
- Keep store actions grouped under an `actions` object.

## Code Organization

- Group feature-specific code under `src/features/[feature]/`.
- Keep `src/ui` for reusable UI primitives, `src/hooks` for shared hooks, and `src/utils` for genuinely shared helpers with no feature-specific behavior.
- Do not add feature logic to `src/` root shared folders just because it is convenient.
- Keep settings-related concerns such as fonts, themes, and UI preferences under `src/features/settings/`.
- Keep keymaps and shortcut logic under `src/features/keymaps/`.
- Keep extension and theme implementation under `src/extensions/`.
- Prefer subfolders such as `components`, `hooks`, `services`, `stores`, `types`, `utils`, and `tests` instead of leaving feature logic in the feature root.
- If a feature contains a distinct subfeature, give it a dedicated nested folder and keep its components, hooks, and helpers close to that subfeature instead of scattering them across the whole feature.
- If a file is only used by one subfeature, keep it inside that subfeature folder instead of promoting it to the feature root.
- Do not put feature-specific code in global shared folders unless it is genuinely shared across features.
- Keep feature tests under `src/features/[feature]/tests/` when practical.
- New user-facing documentation belongs in the `www` repo under `www/docs/`, not in this repo.

## Release Rules

- Validate release changes locally before publishing anything.
- Do not use real release tags to debug release automation.
- Keep Windows MSI versioning numeric-only via `tauri.bundle.windows.wix.version`.
- Release automation is triggered by pushing `v*` tags.
- Use `bun scripts/release.ts <bump> --dry-run` before running a real release command.
