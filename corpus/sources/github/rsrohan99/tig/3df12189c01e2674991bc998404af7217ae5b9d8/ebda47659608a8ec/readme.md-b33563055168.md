# 🐯 Tig
An automonous AI coding agent that runs in the terminal. Similar to Claude Code, OpenAI Codex etc. but works with many more LLMs.

It can: 
- Write code 📝
- Fix bugs 🐛
- Execute shell commands 💻
- Write tests 🧪
- Analyze codebase 🔍 and many more...

All within the terminal! 🚀

### Modes

It has different modes for different tasks:
- 📝 **Architect**: Designs the system, brainstorms ideas with the user, saves the design in a markdown file.
- 💻 **Code**: Implements the architect's plan step by step

✅ LLMs supported so far:
- Google Gemini
- OpenAI
- Claude
- OpenRouter
- Deepseek
- Groq
- Local LLMs using Ollama


## Tools Used

- **LlamaIndex Workflow**: For orchestrating and multiple LLMs support
- **Tree-sitter**: For searching code definitions (functions, classes, etc.) accross the codebase and checking for syntax errors
- **Ripgrep**: For regex search accross the codebase
- **Google's diff-match-patch**: For comparing and displaying diffs


## Requirements

Tig depends on some external tools:

- **Ripgrep**: For regex search accross the codebase

Make sure to install it for your operating system.

For macOS, you can use Homebrew:
```bash
brew install ripgrep
```

For Linux, you can use the package manager for your distro:

For Arch:
```bash
sudo pacman -S ripgrep
```

For Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install ripgrep
```

## Installation (using pip)

Install Tig using pip:
```bash
pip install tig-code
```
Note: If `tig` is not in your PATH, you need to add it first (depends on your python installation)

## Usage

Tig is configured using `.env` file.

Specify the LLM and model to use alongside with appropriate API keys in the `.env` file.
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."
TIG_MODEL="gemini-2.0-flash"
TIG_PROVIDER="google" # available providers: [google, openai, anthropic, deepseek, groq, ollama, openrouter]
```
Provide the right API key variable for the right model e.g. `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for Gemini, `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude, etc.

Now run tig (optionally specify the mode `--mode <code| architect>`):
```bash
tig
```
If you want to auto-approve all the actions taken by Tig (read, write, update files), run `tig` with the `--auto-approve` flag:
```bash
tig --auto-approve
```

Finally when prompted, provide tig with a task to get started:
```txt
...
New task: Create a screen recorder website for chrome
...
```
