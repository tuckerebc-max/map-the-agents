# Bernstein Design

This document describes the current architecture of Bernstein as implemented in the codebase today, with explicit boundaries for partial features.

---

## Core design principles

- Short-lived workers: agents are spawned for focused work and then exit.
- File-first state: runtime state is persisted under `.sdd/`.
- Deterministic orchestration: scheduling and lifecycle decisions are code-driven.
- Verification before closure: task completion passes through janitor/quality logic.
- Multi-adapter runtime: Bernstein is CLI-agent agnostic via adapter interfaces.

---

## High-level architecture

```text
CLI (src/bernstein/cli/)
  -> Task server (src/bernstein/core/server.py shim -> core/server/)
    -> Route modules (src/bernstein/core/routes/)
      -> Store + lifecycle + orchestration (core/ sub-packages)
        -> Adapter-based process spawning (adapters/)
```

Since v1.6, `core/` is organized into ~60 sub-packages. Top-level modules like `core/server.py`, `core/orchestrator.py`, `core/spawner.py`, `core/task_lifecycle.py`, and `core/models.py` are thin re-export shims that redirect to their sub-packages.

Primary orchestration modules:

- `src/bernstein/core/orchestrator.py` (shim) -> `src/bernstein/core/orchestration/orchestrator.py`
- `src/bernstein/core/orchestration/tick_pipeline.py`
- `src/bernstein/core/tasks/task_lifecycle.py`
- `src/bernstein/core/agents/agent_lifecycle.py`

Key runtime subsystems (in sub-packages):

- Routing/cost: `core/routing/router.py`, `core/routing/cascade_router.py`, `core/cost/cost.py`, `core/cost/cost_history.py`, `core/cost/cost_anomaly.py`
- Reliability: `core/agents/heartbeat.py`, `core/cost/completion_budget.py`, `core/observability/loop_detector.py`
- Verification: `core/quality/janitor.py`, `core/quality/quality_gates.py`, `core/security/approval.py`, `core/quality/reviewer.py`
- Context and memory: `core/agents/spawn_prompt.py`, `core/tokens/context.py`, `core/knowledge/lessons.py`, `core/knowledge/knowledge_base.py`, `core/knowledge/rag.py`

---

## API surface (current)

The task server composes router modules from `src/bernstein/core/routes/`, including:

- `tasks.py`
- `status.py`
- `agents.py`
- `costs.py`
- `dashboard.py`
- `quality.py`
- `plans.py`
- `graduation.py`
- `webhooks.py`
- `slack.py`
- `auth.py`
- `observability.py`

Notable implemented endpoint groups:

- Task CRUD, claims, completion/fail, dependencies graph
- Agent heartbeats and process/session inspection
- Cluster node registration/heartbeat/status/task-steal primitives
- Status/events/metrics (including Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint)
- Cost and quality reporting endpoints
- Trigger/webhook ingestion routes

---

## Trigger architecture

Trigger orchestration is implemented and centered on:

- `src/bernstein/core/orchestration/trigger_manager.py`
- `src/bernstein/core/tasks/models.py` (`TriggerEvent`, trigger config models)

Current source adapters:

- `src/bernstein/core/trigger_sources/slack.py`
- `src/bernstein/core/trigger_sources/discord.py`
- `src/bernstein/core/trigger_sources/file_watch.py`
- `src/bernstein/core/trigger_sources/webhook.py`
- `src/bernstein/core/trigger_sources/webhook_node.py`
- `src/bernstein/core/trigger_sources/schedule.py`

Configuration source:

- `.sdd/config/triggers.yaml`

Boundary: trigger infrastructure is real and usable, but project-specific rule libraries and operational runbooks are still evolving.

---

## Cluster and remote execution

Implemented pieces:

- Worker CLI: `src/bernstein/cli/commands/worker_cmd.py`
- Cluster data model/policy: `src/bernstein/core/protocols/cluster/`
- Cluster API routes in `src/bernstein/core/routes/task_cluster.py` and `src/bernstein/core/routes/tasks.py`

Boundary:

- Distributed operation works as an advanced deployment pattern.
- It is not presented as a fully managed autoscaling platform.

---

## Plugins and extensibility

Plugin system is pluggy-based and implemented under:

- `src/bernstein/plugins/hookspecs.py`
- `src/bernstein/plugins/manager.py`

Current hooks include task/agent/evolution lifecycle callbacks.

Boundary:

- Hook surface is stable for common extensions.
- Advanced plugin packaging/marketplace workflows are still light on guardrails.

---

## Observability and telemetry

Implemented:

- Status/event streaming routes
- Prometheus metrics export
- Cost and quality metrics files under `.sdd/metrics/`
- Observability route module for heartbeat/stall insights
- OTLP telemetry configuration hooks in core models/bootstrap path

Boundary:

- Prometheus and OTLP are real integrations.
- Turnkey production dashboards/alert packs are not bundled.

---

## Evolution and planning

Implemented:

- Evolution package (`src/bernstein/evolution/`)
- Plan execution and approval modules (`core/planning/planner.py`, `core/security/plan_approval.py`, plan routes)
- Retrospective/reporting command path (`retro`)

Boundary:

- End-to-end autonomous self-evolution exists with safety controls, but should be treated as operator-supervised in production settings.

---

## `.sdd/` state model (current)

Common active paths:

- `.sdd/backlog/open|claimed|closed/`
- `.sdd/runtime/`
- `.sdd/metrics/`
- `.sdd/traces/`
- `.sdd/memory/`
- `.sdd/caching/`
- `.sdd/agents/`

Exact files vary by enabled features and run mode.

---

## Lifecycle state machines

All task and agent status changes are governed by a deterministic FSM in
`src/bernstein/core/tasks/lifecycle.py`. Every transition is validated against an
explicit table; illegal moves raise `IllegalTransitionError` and emit a typed
`LifecycleEvent` for audit and replay.

See [LIFECYCLE.md](LIFECYCLE.md) for the full state tables, transition metadata,
`TransitionReason`/`AbortReason` enumerations, and abort-chain hierarchy.

### Task FSM (12 states)

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> OPEN : dynamic creation
    [*] --> PLANNED : plan mode

    PLANNED --> OPEN : approved
    PLANNED --> CANCELLED : rejected

    OPEN --> CLAIMED : agent claims task
    OPEN --> WAITING_FOR_SUBTASKS : decomposed before claim
    OPEN --> CANCELLED : manual cancel

    CLAIMED --> IN_PROGRESS : agent starts work
    CLAIMED --> OPEN : unclaim / force-reassign
    CLAIMED --> DONE : fast completion
    CLAIMED --> FAILED : immediate failure
    CLAIMED --> CANCELLED : manual cancel
    CLAIMED --> WAITING_FOR_SUBTASKS : agent splits work
    CLAIMED --> BLOCKED : dependency discovered

    IN_PROGRESS --> DONE : agent reports success
    IN_PROGRESS --> FAILED : agent reports failure
    IN_PROGRESS --> BLOCKED : dependency discovered
    IN_PROGRESS --> WAITING_FOR_SUBTASKS : agent decomposes task
    IN_PROGRESS --> OPEN : requeue / force-reassign
    IN_PROGRESS --> CANCELLED : manual cancel
    IN_PROGRESS --> ORPHANED : heartbeat timeout / crash

    ORPHANED --> DONE : partial work merged
    ORPHANED --> FAILED : unrecoverable
    ORPHANED --> OPEN : requeued for retry

    BLOCKED --> OPEN : dependency resolved
    BLOCKED --> CANCELLED : manual cancel

    WAITING_FOR_SUBTASKS --> DONE : all subtasks completed
    WAITING_FOR_SUBTASKS --> BLOCKED : subtask timeout escalation
    WAITING_FOR_SUBTASKS --> CANCELLED : manual cancel

    FAILED --> OPEN : retry (within max_retries)

    DONE --> CLOSED : janitor verified + merged
    DONE --> FAILED : verification rejected

    CLOSED --> [*]
    CANCELLED --> [*]

    %% PENDING_APPROVAL has no FSM-managed transitions - set directly by the approval subsystem.
    PENDING_APPROVAL --> [*]
```

> **Note - `PENDING_APPROVAL`:** Set directly by the approval subsystem; has no entry or exit in `TASK_TRANSITIONS`. See [LIFECYCLE.md](LIFECYCLE.md#terminal-states) for details.

### Agent FSM (4 states)

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> starting : spawn()

    starting --> working : process confirmed alive
    starting --> dead : spawn failure / fast exit

    working --> idle : task completed, awaiting reuse
    working --> dead : crash / kill / timeout / circuit break

    idle --> working : new task assigned
    idle --> dead : idle recycled (resource reclaim)

    dead --> [*]
```

### Agent Turn FSM (10 states)

Tracks the lifecycle of a single task-handling turn within an agent process.
Source: `src/bernstein/core/agents/agent_turn_state.py`.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> IDLE

    IDLE --> CLAIMING : task_claimed

    CLAIMING --> SPAWNING : agent_spawned
    CLAIMING --> FAILED : task_failed

    SPAWNING --> RUNNING : agent_spawned
    SPAWNING --> FAILED : task_failed

    RUNNING --> TOOL_USE : tool_started
    RUNNING --> COMPACTING : compact_needed
    RUNNING --> VERIFYING : verify_requested
    RUNNING --> FAILED : task_failed

    TOOL_USE --> RUNNING : tool_completed
    TOOL_USE --> FAILED : task_failed

    COMPACTING --> RUNNING : verify_requested
    COMPACTING --> FAILED : task_failed

    VERIFYING --> COMPLETING : task_completed
    VERIFYING --> RUNNING : compact_needed
    VERIFYING --> FAILED : task_failed

    COMPLETING --> REAPED : agent_reaped

    FAILED --> REAPED : agent_reaped

    REAPED --> [*]
```
