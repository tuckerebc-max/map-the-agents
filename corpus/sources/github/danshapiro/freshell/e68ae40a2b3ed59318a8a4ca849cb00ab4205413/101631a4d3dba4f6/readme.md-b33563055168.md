## Features

- **Tabs and panes** — Organize projects with multiple coding agents, shells, browsers, editors, and more on a tab - and as many tabs as you want.
- **Desktop, laptop, phone** — Run on your main machine, then work on your project anywhere via VPN or Tailscale.
- **Speak with the dead** — Resume any Claude, Codex, or OpenCode session from any device (even if you weren't using freshell to run it)
- **Fancy tabs** — Auto-name from terminal content, drag-and-drop reorder, and per-pane type icons so you know what's in each tab
- **Freshclaude** — An interactive alternative to Claude CLI that works with your Anthropic subscription. Rich chat UI with collapsible tool strips, token budget display, and full session persistence.
- **Extension system** — Add new pane types, CLI integrations, and server-side services via manifest-based extensions. Enable and disable from the Extensions management page.
- **Self-configuring workspace** — Just ask Claude or Codex to open a browser in a pane, or create a tab with four subagents. Built-in tmux-like API and skill makes it simple.
- **Live pane headers** — See your active directory, git branch, and context usage in every pane title bar, updating live as you work. Fresh-agent panes carry their context meter in their status strip instead of the header.
- **Host pressure dashboard pane** — CPU, memory, pressure, and I/O at a glance with near-zero overhead (metrics stream only while you're watching). Linux, WSL, and macOS only — not shown on Windows.
- **Activity notifications** — Configurable attention indicators (highlight, pulse, darken) on tabs and pane headers when a coding CLI finishes its turn, with click or type dismiss modes
- **AI-powered session titles** — Right-click any session and generate a Gemini-powered title based on conversation content
- **Progressive sidebar search** — Two-phase search with instant local results followed by deep server-side content search
- **Mobile responsive** — Auto-collapsing sidebar and overlay navigation for phones and tablets
- **Stream Deck** — Drive freshell from an Elgato Stream Deck: tabs on keys with repo icons and status backgrounds (or classic live previews and status rings), press to focus, long-press to approve or stop agents. See [Stream Deck](#stream-deck).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository at the latest stable release
git clone --branch v0.7.5 https://github.com/danshapiro/freshell.git
cd freshell

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and run
npm run serve
```

On first run, freshell auto-generates a `.env` file with a secure random `AUTH_TOKEN`. The token is printed to the console at startup — open the URL shown to connect.

## Prerequisites

Node.js 18+ (20+ recommended) and platform build tools for native modules (`windows-build-tools` on Windows, Xcode CLI Tools on macOS, `build-essential python3` on Linux).

> **Note:** On native Windows, terminals default to WSL. Set `WINDOWS_SHELL=cmd` or `WINDOWS_SHELL=powershell` to use a native Windows shell instead.

## Desktop profiles (multiple instances)

The desktop app normally runs one instance with one configuration. **Profiles**
let you run multiple independent desktop clients on the same machine at the
same time — for example one connected to your work server and one to a
personal server.

Each named profile gets its own:

- settings, window state, and logs (`~/.freshell-<id>/`; the default profile
  keeps using `~/.freshell/`)
- Electron storage dir (`…/Freshell-<id>` in packaged builds,
  `freshell-<id>` in dev/unpackaged runs), so cookies and localStorage never
  mix
- single-instance lock: launching the same profile twice focuses the running
  window; different profiles run side by side

### Defining profiles

Create `~/.freshell/profiles.json`:

```json
{
  "profiles": [
    { "id": "work", "label": "Work" },
    { "id": "home" }
  ]
}
```

Rules: `id` is lowercase letters/digits/dashes starting with a letter or digit
(max 32 chars); `default` and `profile-picker` are reserved (the first means
the original un-namespaced environment; the second is the picker launcher's
own storage dir); `label` is optional display text.

When at least one named profile is defined, launching the app without a
profile shows a picker (the default profile is always listed first; the built-
in default counts, so one named profile in the file already means "more than
one configured"). The picker is a small launcher: whichever profile you pick,
the app relaunches itself pinned to it — you'll see a quick restart, then the
app continues in the chosen profile. Pin a launch to a profile with
`--profile=<id>` or `FRESHELL_PROFILE=<id>`; named ids do not have to be
listed in `profiles.json` — an unlisted id simply starts with a fresh
configuration.

### Notes and limitations

- Global hotkey: the first instance to register an accelerator keeps it;
  later instances log a warning (`global_hotkey_registration_failed`) and have
  no hotkey. Give each profile a distinct hotkey in its own settings.
- App-bound servers: each profile spawns its own server pinned to that
  profile's config dir (`FRESHELL_CONFIG_DIR`) and port — a named profile
  never adopts another profile's already-running local server; choose a
  distinct port per profile. Once named profiles exist (listed in
  `profiles.json`, used from the command line, or previously run — including
  a stray `~/.freshell-<id>` backup dir, which shape-checks by name), the same
  applies to the **Default** profile: it no longer auto-attaches to a
  discovered local server, and if its configured port is held by a neighbor,
  Freshell bumps to the next free port and saves that port into the profile's
  settings (visible in the setup summary). An app-bound profile that finds
  its OWN config dir's server already resident attaches to it instead of
  double-spawning.
- Daemon services (`freshell.service`, `com.freshell.server`,
  "Freshell Server" task) are machine-global single instances — daemon mode is
  available only on the **Default** profile; named profiles fall back to the
  chooser instead.
- Silent-install provisioning (`desktop.provision`) applies to the default
  profile only.
- Auto-update relaunches the app without `--profile`: after an update, the
  picker shows again (pick your profile back).
- Installing/upgrading on Windows terminates all running Freshell instances.
- Relaunching while a profile is running: on Linux/Windows, a launch without a
  flag shows the picker again and choosing the running profile focuses its
  window; launching with the same `--profile` as a running instance focuses
  that window (the new process quits). On macOS, relaunching from Finder or
  the Dock while ANY Freshell instance is running just activates the running
  instance (the OS enforces this) and never shows the picker — use
  `--profile=` flags or `FRESHELL_PROFILE` from a terminal, or Quit before
  relaunching to get the picker. Two simultaneous flag-less launches race for
  the picker's launcher slot: the first shows the picker; the second quietly
  exits and brings the existing picker forward.
- Daemon-service caveat for the Node server: the shipped daemon templates have
  always contained an (until now inert) `FRESHELL_CONFIG_DIR` environment
  line; starting with this release the Node server honors it. If you
  hand-generated a daemon unit from those templates with a non-default config
  directory, the value now takes effect at next start (state relocates to that
  directory): remove the line from your unit, or move your existing
  `~/.freshell` contents into the directory it names. Units using the default
  `~/.freshell` path are unaffected — and if your service's working directory
  is not the config dir (systemd user units default to `$HOME`), the server
  copies an existing `.env` from the old location into the config dir rather
  than rotating your token. Rust-server installs never read this
  variable.

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev     # Development with hot reload
npm run serve   # Production build and run
```

`npm run serve` is intended for `main`. If you run it from another branch, Freshell asks for confirmation in an interactive terminal and refuses in non-interactive shells unless `FRESHELL_ALLOW_NON_MAIN_SERVE=1` is set.

### Fresh agents

Freshclaude, Freshcodex, and Freshopencode share a chat interface with attachments, tool output, questions, and approval controls. Use `/model` or click the model name to choose a model and thinking level. Changes apply to your next message; the picker remembers recent choices for each project.

You can queue follow-up messages while an agent works. They run one at a time, and the queue stays available if the session disconnects or ends. Expand the queue to read or cancel individual messages. Codex permission settings control when it asks for approval; “Never ask” does not change the session’s file or network access limits.

## Stream Deck

Freshell can drive an Elgato Stream Deck straight from the browser. Each key shows a tab — by default the **Status icons** style: title on top, centered repo icons, and a status background (green for tabs that want attention), with keys sorted so attention-seeking tabs come first. Press a key to focus that tab; long-press (500 ms) to open an action layer with BACK / APPROVE / STOP keys (it closes itself after 10 s). When you have more tabs than keys, the last key pages through them (wrapping around). On a Stream Deck +, the dials cycle tabs and flip pages and the touch strip shows the active tab plus busy/waiting counts (waiting = tabs that finished a turn or are waiting for approval). The deck dims after a configurable idle timeout and wakes on activity.

**Requirements**

- Chrome or Edge (WebHID). Not supported in the freshell desktop app — use Chrome or Edge instead.
- An Elgato Stream Deck. The Stream Deck Mini is the primary target; other models (including the Stream Deck + dials and touch strip) are driven by their reported capabilities.

**Connecting:** Settings → Stream Deck → turn on **Enable Stream Deck**, click **Connect Stream Deck**, and pick the device in the browser prompt. After that first grant, freshell reconnects automatically — including after unplug/replug and page reloads. Deck settings are stored in the browser (localStorage), so they are per browser profile, not per freshell server.

**Virtual deck:** Settings → Stream Deck → **Show virtual deck** opens an on-screen deck panel that mirrors the keys. It works without any hardware — and in browsers without WebHID.

**Tile style:** Settings → Stream Deck → **Tile style** switches between **Status icons** (the default, described above) and **Terminal previews** — the classic look with a title banner, a live mini terminal preview on each key, and colored status rings (blue busy, green needs-attention, amber waiting for approval), with keys in plain tab-bar order. Switching takes effect immediately, on the hardware deck and the virtual deck alike.

**Linux device permissions (udev):** hidraw device nodes default to root-only, so the browser cannot open the deck until you grant access to the Elgato vendor id (`0fd9`):

```bash
sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/50-elgato-stream-deck.rules >/dev/null <<'EOF'
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fd9", TAG+="uaccess"
KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fd9", TAG+="uaccess"
EOF
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

Then unplug and replug the deck. Without the rule, the connection status shows "In use by another window or app — or missing device permissions (Linux udev)" — the browser cannot distinguish the two failure causes.

**Chrome Memory Saver:** Chrome's Memory Saver can discard a long-hidden freshell tab even while the deck is connected — the deck goes dark until you revisit the tab. To avoid this, add your freshell URL to Memory Saver's "Always keep this site active" list (`chrome://settings/performance`).

### Coding CLI Providers

Freshell indexes local session history and can launch terminals for these coding CLIs:

| Provider | Session history | Launch terminals | Home directory |
|----------|:-:|:-:|----------------|
| **Claude Code** | Yes | Yes | `~/.claude` |
| **Codex** | Yes | Yes | `~/.codex` |
| **OpenCode** | Yes | Yes | `XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode` (or platform default) |
| **Gemini** | — | Yes | — |
| **Kimi** | — | Yes | — |
| **Amplifier** | Yes | Yes | `~/.amplifier` |

Enable/disable providers and set defaults in the Settings UI or via `~/.freshell/config.json`.
OpenCode sessions are discovered directly from OpenCode's local session database, so existing OpenCode work can be resumed from freshell without importing anything manually.

OpenCode permissions are controlled by the OpenCode configuration for the OS user running freshell. Freshell does not set `OPENCODE_PERMISSION` or pass `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for OpenCode sessions; OS filesystem permissions remain the hard boundary.

Amplifier loads the freshell MCP only if its bundle mounts `tool-mcp` (the default `anchors` bundle does not). Add `tool-mcp` to your Amplifier bundle to enable orchestration.
