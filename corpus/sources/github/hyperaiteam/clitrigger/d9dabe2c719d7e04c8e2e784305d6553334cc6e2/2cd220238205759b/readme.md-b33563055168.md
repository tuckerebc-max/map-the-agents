> ### Docs → Plan → Terminal → Autonomous Tasks → Version Control. One pipeline.
>
> Developing with AI CLI agents (Claude Code, Codex, …) scatters the workflow across disconnected tools: requirements in a note app, plans in another tool, agents across a pile of terminal windows, results in a git client. Editor-centric development has the IDE; CLI-agent-centric development doesn't — so the one ferrying context between tools ends up being you.
>
> CLITrigger is that missing IDE. It connects the whole workflow into a single five-stage pipeline — build project knowledge in **Docs**, shape it into a plan with the **planner & calendar**, refine it live in **terminal sessions**, hand it to multiple AI CLIs (**Claude Code · Antigravity · Codex**) for **parallel autonomous execution** in isolated git worktrees, and land the results through the **review queue and built-in Git client**.
>
> **Each stage inherits the context of the one before it — the intent you captured in docs flows all the way to the merge.**

## Why CLITrigger?

**The tools don't talk to each other.** As AI writes more of the code, the developer's real job becomes capturing intent and reviewing output — yet that intent lives in a note app, the plan in another tool, the agents in a stack of terminal windows, and the results in a git client. Editor-centric development solved this decades ago with the IDE. CLI-agent-centric development never got one.

CLITrigger is built as that IDE. Its backbone is a single pipeline — **Docs → Plan → Terminal → Autonomous Tasks → Version Control** — where each stage is not a separate tool but a consumer of the previous stage's context: docs become plans, plans become the agent's prompt, execution results arrive in a review queue. Intent is never lost between stages.

Inside the pipeline sits the execution machinery:

- **Parallel execution** — every task runs in its own isolated git worktree, with Claude / Antigravity / Codex working simultaneously
- **Scheduling around rate limits** — cron-based runs and auto-retry at quota reset make full use of your tokens, even while you're away
- **Multi-agent quality** — architect / developer / reviewer agents debate before implementation, beating a single agent working alone
- **One place to land it** — triage every diff in the review queue, then commit, push, and merge in the built-in Git client

## Features

The features follow the five pipeline stages — **📚 Docs → 🗓 Plan → ⌨️ Terminal → 🤖 Autonomous Tasks → 🔀 Version Control** — plus the supporting features underneath. Each feature below has a full guide in the **[Wiki](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki)** (↗).

### 📚 1. Docs — build the knowledge

#### Docs (File-based Knowledge)
A per-project Obsidian-style knowledge base with a `[[wikilink]]` graph — inject any file into a prompt, CLI-agnostically. What accumulates here is the input to the whole pipeline. [↗](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki/Plan-&-Organize#vault)

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/main/docs/images/screenshot-vault.png" alt="Docs — Obsidian-style file-based knowledge with a link graph" width="800">
  <p><em>The Docs tab — browse project markdown with inline preview and a force-directed wikilink graph, then selectively inject files into prompts</em></p>
</div>

### 🗓 2. Plan — capture the intent

#### My Schedule
One personal calendar overlaying your memos, every project's schedules, planner due dates, and assigned Jira issues. [↗](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki/Plan-&-Organize#my-schedule)

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/main/docs/images/screenshot-agenda.png" alt="My Schedule — personal calendar overlaying memos, schedules, planner & Jira" width="800">
  <p><em>One calendar overlaying personal memos, cross-project schedules, planner due dates, and assigned Jira issues</em></p>
</div>

#### Planner
A lightweight task planner — capture ideas, then convert any item into a TODO, schedule, or session; Markdown import/export. What you plan here becomes the execution unit of the next stage. [↗](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki/Plan-&-Organize#planner)

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/main/docs/images/screenshot-planer.png" alt="Planner — Lightweight task management" width="800">
  <p><em>Inline editing, color-coded tags, image attachments, and one-click conversion to TODOs or schedules</em></p>
</div>

### ⌨️ 3. Terminal — refine it with AI

#### Interactive Sessions
Long-lived CLI sessions in floating windows with VS Code-style docking, pop-out, and real xterm.js terminals — the human-in-the-loop stage before handing work off to automation. [↗](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki/Delegate-to-AI#interactive-sessions)

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/main/docs/images/screenshot-sessions.png" alt="Sessions — Multi-CLI floating windows with VS Code-style docking" width="800">
  <p><em>Claude, Antigravity, and Codex sessions docked side-by-side via VS Code-style window grouping — each running in its own worktree branch</em></p>
</div>

### 🤖 4. Autonomous Tasks — AI executes in parallel

#### Parallel Worktree Execution (Tasks)
Every TODO runs in its own git worktree with Claude / Antigravity / Codex in parallel, plus dependency chains and merge control. [↗](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki/Delegate-to-AI#parallel-worktree-execution)

#### Multi-Agent Discussion
Architect / developer / reviewer agents debate before implementing, then commit code or send action items to the planner. [↗](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki/Delegate-to-AI#multi-agent-discussion)

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/main/docs/images/screenshot-discussions.png" alt="Discussions — Multi-agent debate" width="800">
  <p><em>Multiple AI agents with different roles debating in the Discussion view</em></p>
</div>

#### Scheduled Execution
Run tasks on cron or one-off schedules, with auto-retry at the exact rate-limit reset time. [↗](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki/Delegate-to-AI#scheduled-execution)

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/main/docs/images/screenshot-schedules.png" alt="Schedules — Scheduled execution" width="800">
  <p><em>Cron-based recurring and one-time scheduled task execution</em></p>
</div>

#### Multi-CLI & Sandbox Mode
Pick Claude / Antigravity / Codex per project, TODO, or agent; strict sandbox confines file access to the worktree. [↗](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki/Delegate-to-AI#multi-cli--sandbox-mode)

### 🔀 5. Version Control — review and land it

#### Morning Review Queue
Triage every overnight TODO across projects in one keyboard-driven card stack — navigate, merge, or discard in a keypress. [↗](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki/Review-&-Ship#morning-review-queue)

#### Built-in Git Client
A Fork / SourceTree-style Git client in the browser — stage, commit, push, and manage branches and diffs. This is where AI output lands in your history, closing the pipeline. [↗](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki/Review-&-Ship#built-in-git-client)

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/main/docs/images/screenshot-git.png" alt="Git — Built-in client" width="800">
  <p><em>Commit graph, branch actions, file diffs — all in the browser</em></p>
</div>

### 🧰 Supporting the pipeline

#### Analytics
Per-project cost and execution stats — by CLI, by status, and over time. [↗](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki/Review-&-Ship#analytics)

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/main/docs/images/screenshot-analytics.png" alt="Analytics — Execution stats" width="800">
  <p><em>Cost and token usage broken down by CLI, status, and over time</em></p>
</div>

#### Live Logs (Chat & Raw)
Real-time WebSocket log streaming in Chat (markdown) or Raw (terminal) mode. [↗](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki/Review-&-Ship#live-logs)

#### Favorites Launcher
One-click launcher for your frequent external tools (executables, commands, URLs) from the sidebar. [↗](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki/Plan-&-Organize#favorites-launcher)

#### Remote Access
Reach CLITrigger from anywhere via Cloudflare Tunnel, with completion notifications and custom-domain routing. [↗](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki/Remote-Access)

#### MCP Server
Expose CLITrigger to any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code) over an HTTP endpoint — list projects, create and run tasks, and check status just by chatting with your AI. Copy the ready-made config (URL + token) from Settings → MCP; works for npm, desktop, and tunnel users alike. [↗](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/wiki/MCP-Server)

## Quick Start

### Option A — Desktop App (recommended for end users)

Download the installer for your platform from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger/releases/latest):

- **Windows** — `CLITrigger-Setup-<version>.exe` (NSIS installer) or the portable `.exe`
- **macOS** — `CLITrigger-<version>.dmg` (Apple Silicon & Intel)
- **Linux** — `CLITrigger-<version>.AppImage`

The desktop app bundles Node.js and the native modules (`better-sqlite3`, `node-pty`, `cloudflared`), so no separate runtime install is needed. On first launch a setup screen appears in the embedded browser — pick a password there and you're in. External sharing (Cloudflare tunnel) stays paused until setup completes, so the first user is guaranteed to be you.

### Option B — npm (recommended for developers)

```bash
# Install
npm i -g clitrigger
clitrigger

# Upgrade to the latest version
npm i -g clitrigger@latest
# Check current version: clitrigger --version
```

On first run the server starts immediately. Open `http://localhost:3000` → set a password on the welcome screen → register a project → write TODOs → click Start. Change the password later via Settings → Account in the web UI.

CLITrigger also prints a one-line `Update available: <new> -> npm i -g clitrigger@latest` hint at startup whenever a newer version is on npm — no auto-update, you decide when to upgrade.

```bash
# Change settings
clitrigger config port 8080    # Change port
clitrigger config tunnel on    # Enable Cloudflare tunnel for external sharing
```

> **Prerequisites**: Node.js 22+ (use an **LTS** release), Git, at least one AI CLI (Claude / Antigravity / Codex)
>
> **Supported Platforms**: Windows · macOS · Linux — all core code is cross-platform compatible.
> Prefer an LTS (even-numbered) Node.js. A brand-new major (e.g. an odd/just-released version) may not have prebuilt native binaries yet, which forces a source build requiring a C++ toolchain (Visual Studio Build Tools on Windows, `xcode-select --install` on macOS).

### Run from Source (for development)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

```bash
# 1. Clone & install
git clone https://github.com/HyperAITeam/CLITrigger.git
cd CLITrigger
npm install
cd src/client && npm install && cd ../..

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# AUTH_PASSWORD is optional — leave it blank and the dev server will show the
# setup screen on first browser load. Set it only if you want to skip setup.

# 3. Run
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

#### Windows One-Click Scripts

Double-click any bat file in `scripts/` — no terminal needed.

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `install.bat` | Install dependencies (first time) |
| `dev.bat` | Start development mode |
| `build.bat` | Build project |
| `start.bat` | Start production server |
| `start-tunnel.bat` | Start with Cloudflare Tunnel |
| `test.bat` | Run all tests |

#### macOS / Linux

`npm run` commands work identically on all platforms. Use the terminal instead of `.bat` scripts.

```bash
npm run dev        # Development mode
npm run build      # Build
npm run start      # Production server
npm test           # Run tests
```

</details>

### Remote Access (Cloudflare Tunnel)

```bash
# Install cloudflared
winget install cloudflare.cloudflared    # Windows
brew install cloudflared                  # macOS

# Set TUNNEL_ENABLED=true in .env, then:
npm run start:tunnel
# → Outputs https://xxxx.trycloudflare.com in the console
```

#### Route a named tunnel through your own domain (optional)

To avoid the "dangerous site" browser warnings on `*.trycloudflare.com` / `*.cfargotunnel.com`, point a named tunnel at your own domain. Either use the sidebar ⚙ → Tunnel settings modal (Tunnel Name + Custom Hostname), or the CLI:

```bash
clitrigger config tunnel hostname app.your-domain.com
cloudflared tunnel route dns <tunnel-name> app.your-domain.com   # one-time
```

The displayed URL becomes `https://app.your-domain.com` and reputation tracks your domain.
