  Vendo is for B2B SaaS teams whose customers keep asking for bespoke features. It is an <b>embedded agent</b>: it acts through your product's own API as the signed-in user, and renders the UI it generates in a sandboxed, brand-native surface. Your source code is never touched.

Paste this inside your app's repo:

<!-- Canonical prompt text: packages/vendo/src/agent-prompt.ts (mirrored by the
     docs AgentPrompt card). Change it there first. -->

```text
Install Vendo in this repo. Read https://vendo.run/agents.md and follow
it exactly. Relay Vendo's setup questions to me and use my answers. Ask me
before creating any account or key — Vendo Cloud is the recommended option.
You're done when my app runs and the agent answers from my own API.
Then ask me whether I'd like to star it via
https://vendo.run/star?src=readme to support the project.
```

Done is your app running and the agent answering from your own API. `vendo
doctor` is the optional checkup, and every code it prints links to its exact
fix. Full
playbook: [docs.vendo.run/install](https://docs.vendo.run/install) ·
Agent-readable: [vendo.run/agents.md](https://vendo.run/agents.md)

**Which one are you?**<br>
[**You already have an agent**](https://docs.vendo.run/existing-agent/quickstart) — one tool pack for your AI SDK, Mastra, or homegrown loop.<br>
[**Your product has no agent**](https://docs.vendo.run/quickstart) — one command brings the loop, the chat UI, and the approvals.<br>
[**Expose your product over MCP**](https://docs.vendo.run/outside-agents/how-the-door-works) — Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and Claude Code act as the signed-in user.<br>
[**Your agent lives in your backend**](https://docs.vendo.run/backend/quickstart) — one package, `agent()` and `chat()`, no CLI and no UI of ours to mount.

## How it works

Vendo runs a streaming agent with any AI SDK `LanguageModel`.

**1 · Extract.** Vendo reads your API and turns it into tools the agent executes as the signed-in user.

**2 · Generate.** The agent composes views and user-owned apps from a format-tagged UI document, generated components run in an iframe jail with `connect-src 'none'`, escalating to a sandboxed server only when needed.

**3 · Guard.** Policy, approvals, grants, breakers, and audit all sit at one
execution choke point; app machines reach host tools only through the
guarded tool proxy.

PGlite at `.vendo/data` is the zero-config store; production runs the same
schema on Postgres. Full architecture: [docs.vendo.run](https://docs.vendo.run).

## Packages

`@vendoai/vendo` is the default composition (`vendoai` is a thin alias).
Install individual blocks when you want to compose Vendo yourself.

| Package | One job |
| --- | --- |
| `@vendoai/vendo/core` | Shared types, schemas, formats, validators, seams, and the browser-safe app-generation contract (`@vendoai/vendo/core/apps`) |
| `@vendoai/vendo/ui` | Headless React hooks, optional chrome, tree rendering, and the in-jail component kit |
| `@vendoai/vendo` | Default composition, public wire, React entry, `vendo` bin, and the app-generation, sandbox, persistence, actions, telemetry, automations, knowledge, MCP-door, guard and harness blocks |

Cloud-gated sharing, publishing, org overlays, and pinning activate with
`VENDO_API_KEY`; the open-source blocks remain self-hosted.
