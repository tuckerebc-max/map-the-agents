# CodeAlmanac Python Port Live Agreement

This file records the active agreement for the Python rewrite of CodeAlmanac.
It is the constraint document for future agents.

## Current Decisions

- 2026-07-15: Anonymous product telemetry is the only remote product exception
  in Python v1. Setup asks last, defaults to the recommended Yes, keeps a visible
  No, and `--no-telemetry`, `telemetry.enabled = false`, `DO_NOT_TRACK`, or
  `CODEALMANAC_NO_TELEMETRY` disable all capture. A random installation UUID in
  local SQLite identifies events and may have a UUID-only PostHog person
  profile; no name or email exists until a future login explicitly links an
  opaque account identity. GeoIP is disabled. Allowlisted command and lifecycle
  outcomes may leave the machine, and real unhandled foreground/background
  Python exceptions may send only their type, stable structural fingerprint,
  and CodeAlmanac-only stack shape. Code, exception messages, paths, args,
  queries, repository/run identifiers, prompts,
  transcripts, Git data, provider session IDs, locals, environment variables,
  and code variables never leave the machine.
- 2026-07-16: Lifecycle telemetry exports a model only when its harness/model
  pair matches the central controlled catalog; unknown or incompatible values
  drop the event. Durable `RunSpec` remains readable independently of that
  changing outbound catalog so historical queued records do not become invalid.
- 2026-06-29: Python v1 is a local product. Do not build hosted shipping,
  hosted CLI, login/connect/upload, SDK, or MCP in this rewrite.
- 2026-07-05: `e773dc0b` is the fork point for the right local Python product.
  Later `dev` and `main` moved ahead on the wrong hosted/cloud direction. Use
  those branches and `archive/code/` as reference material only.
- 2026-07-05: Happy path is the product path. Do not preserve backward
  compatibility for old CLI names, old wiki roots, old page layouts,
  hosted-product assumptions, or retired syntaxes.
- 2026-07-05: Intelligence lives in prompts, not pipelines. Auto-commit is
  prompt policy given to lifecycle agents, not CodeAlmanac staging or smart Git
  orchestration. The default is `auto_commit = true`; `setup --no-auto-commit`
  and `config set auto_commit false` only change the prompt permission.
- 2026-07-06: Lifecycle runs do not require a clean `almanac/` before starting.
  Explicit runs snapshot the current Git state, allow pre-existing wiki edits,
  reject files changed during the run outside `almanac/`, and validate the final
  wiki before marking the run done.
- 2026-07-06: The run/repository/local-database refactor is a breaking
  architectural reset. The final code shape is what counts: no half-migrated
  concepts, no compatibility aliases, no `registry.json` migration, no
  `registry.json` fallback, no root hopping, and no parallel local state paths.
  Repository registration, runs, run events, sync state, and worker locks belong
  in `~/.codealmanac/codealmanac.db`.
- 2026-07-06: Use the durable internal nouns `repository`, `run`, `run kind`,
  `queued run`, `worker`, `schedule`, `trigger`, and `local database`.
  Public `jobs` remains the user-facing control command for attach/logs/cancel,
  but internal models, stores, and tables use `runs` and `run_events`.
- 2026-07-06: Sync is a trigger/scanner, not agent work and not a run. Scheduled
  sync reads active Claude/Codex transcript files since
  `sync_state.last_completed_at` or `now - sync_interval`, reads each transcript
  identity, exact-matches transcript cwd to a registered repository, skips
  internal transcripts, groups active transcripts by repository, and queues one
  ingest run per repository. No quiet window, cursor ledger, line-count ledger,
  prefix hash, pending claim, needs-attention state, or foreground/background
  execution mode remains in the target design.
- 2026-07-06: `init` is deterministic repository setup plus a `build` run. It
  creates the repository row, `almanac/`, `almanac/README.md`, and
  `almanac/topics.yaml`, materializes the packaged writing manuals under
  `almanac/manual/`, then queues/runs `build` for the first real agent-authored
  wiki. `init` fails with a product error such as `AlreadyExists` when
  `almanac/` already exists at the target path.
- 2026-07-06: Code quality is part of the contract. Use Pydantic request models
  for shaped service inputs, enums or `Literal` for stable choices, service-owned
  verbs, store-owned persistence, consistent product errors, and thin CLI edges.
  Avoid internal-looking single-underscore functions except when they are tiny,
  local, and clearer than a named boundary.
- 2026-06-29: The branch may contain merged `dev` / `origin/dev` work that
  assumes hosted shipping. Treat that work as reference or archive material,
  not as product direction for this rewrite.
- 2026-06-29: The old TypeScript/Node implementation is archived under
  `archive/code/`. Use it as behavior reference, not as code to preserve.
- 2026-07-01: "Behavior reference" means the archived product behavior should
  be ported unless a decision below explicitly drops it. The Python rewrite is
  allowed to improve architecture and naming, but it must not silently simplify
  away setup UX, lifecycle semantics, harness events, page provenance, or
  viewer scope.
- 2026-06-29: Public command, package, and user-state language is
  `codealmanac`. Do not call the product Codex Almanac, and do not add public
  `almanac` or `alm` aliases for compatibility. Python identifiers may use
  normal class-name casing such as `CodeAlmanac`.
- 2026-06-29: The Python rewrite targets new CodeAlmanac users. Do not keep
  TypeScript-era backward compatibility, legacy aliases, legacy root
  migrations, or old frontmatter repair paths.
- 2026-07-01: The intentionally dropped archive-era surfaces are: public
  `almanac`/`alm` compatibility bins, hosted login/connect/upload/MCP/SDK
  surfaces, migration commands unless a migration need becomes concrete, and
  the `review` command family for now. `setup`, `uninstall`, structured page
  `sources:`, multi-wiki `serve`, background jobs, and rich harness events are
  not intentionally dropped.
- 2026-06-29: "Frontmatter rewrite" means deterministic editing of current
  page metadata such as `topics:` while preserving page body text. It is not a
  compatibility layer for old page formats.
- 2026-06-29: Repo-owned wiki data lives under `almanac/` only. The committed
  tree is browseable nested Markdown. Runtime state belongs under
  `~/.codealmanac/`.
- 2026-07-01: Current-repo auto-detection is exact. Commands that need a
  repository run from a registered repository root or receive `--wiki <name>`.
  CodeAlmanac does not walk parent directories to find an `almanac/` tree.
- 2026-06-30: Global user state belongs to `~/.codealmanac/`. The repo-local
  folder may be named `almanac/`; user config, local database state, and
  scheduler logs use the product-specific hidden directory.
- 2026-06-29: Follow Almanac's Python style: service symmetry, explicit request
  models, service-owned verbs, store-owned persistence, thin CLI edges.
- 2026-07-01: CLI render follows the parser/dispatch/render domain split.
  `cli/render/root.py` is a small re-export facade for dispatcher stability.
  `cli/render/wiki.py` is a wiki-render facade only; `search.py` owns
  search/reindex output, `pages.py` owns show/page output, `topics.py` owns
  topic output, `health.py` owns health and validate output, and `tagging.py` owns
  tag/untag output. `lifecycle.py` owns lifecycle/sync/job-start output, and
  `cli/render/admin.py` is an admin-render facade only; `automation.py` owns
  automation output, `diagnostics.py` owns doctor output, `jobs.py` owns jobs
  output, `updates.py` owns update output, and `setup.py` owns setup/uninstall
  output plus Rich presentation. `common.py` owns shared formatting helpers.
- 2026-07-01: Wiki CLI dispatch follows the same command-family split.
  `cli/dispatch/wiki.py` remains the wiki-command facade for
  search/show/health/validate/reindex/tag/untag routing. `topics.py` owns topic
  subcommand request construction, and `serve.py` owns local viewer startup.
  Do not move topic request construction or uvicorn startup back into
  `dispatch/wiki.py`.
- 2026-07-01: Lifecycle CLI dispatch follows the same command-family split.
  `cli/dispatch/lifecycle.py` remains the lifecycle-command facade;
  `build.py` owns init/build request construction, `operations.py` owns
  ingest/garden request construction, `sync.py` owns sync and sync
  status request construction, and `worker.py` owns the hidden queue-drain
  entrypoint. Do not move workflow request construction, sync source parsing,
  or worker-drain request construction back into `dispatch/lifecycle.py`.
- 2026-07-01: Admin CLI parser construction follows the same command-family
  split. `cli/parser/admin.py` remains the admin-parser facade; `setup.py`
  owns setup/uninstall flags, `diagnostics.py` owns doctor flags, `updates.py`
  owns update flags, `jobs.py` owns jobs flags, and `automation.py` owns
  automation flags and task choices. Do not move command flag construction
  back into `parser/admin.py`.
- 2026-06-30: Validation belongs at product boundaries. Use Pydantic request,
  settings, and domain models for shaped data; use enums or literals for finite
  choices; reject invalid user/product input with explicit errors. Adapter-local
  tolerance can use small built-in parsers that return `None` for loose
  outside-world state, such as reading an existing launchd plist.
- 2026-06-29: Public-release readiness is now evidence-gated in
  `docs/python-port/public-release-readiness.md`. Further work should bias
  toward clean-install proof, real lifecycle dogfood, prompt quality, package
  metadata, README accuracy, and browser verification instead of adding
  speculative architecture seams.
- 2026-07-01: Background jobs are in scope for v1. Restore the archived
  machinery in Python shape: per-wiki queue, worker lock, background process
  owner, durable job/run spec and record files, append-only event logs, attach,
  cancel, stale-lock handling, and safe foreground execution when explicitly
  requested. Automation may schedule commands, but the implementation should
  call workflow/services directly rather than shelling out internally.
- 2026-06-29: Manual `update` is a foreground package-manager command and has
  pip/uv non-editable install dogfood.
- 2026-07-06: Scheduled auto-update is an explicit local automation task, not a
  sync/Garden side effect and not a hosted updater. Plain `setup --yes`
  installs sync, Garden, and daily `update` automation. Interactive onboarding
  asks whether CodeAlmanac should stay up to date automatically; `--yes` takes
  the happy-path default.
- 2026-07-06: Scheduled `update` takes a global lock under `~/.codealmanac/`,
  skips when another update is running, skips when queued/running lifecycle jobs
  exist, skips editable/source installs, supports non-editable uv tool and pip
  installs, and runs `codealmanac --version` plus `codealmanac doctor --json`
  as post-update smoke checks.
- 2026-07-06: `uninstall` is full uninstall. Do not expose
  `--target`, `--keep-automation`, `--keep-instructions`, or other
  partial-uninstall flags. The command removes CodeAlmanac-owned instructions,
  automation, global state, and the installed binary when the install method
  supports removal. It never deletes repo `almanac/`.
- 2026-06-29 (superseded 2026-07-15): There was no cloud capture surface in
  Python v1 before the narrowly agreed anonymous product-telemetry exception.
  `codealmanac update` updates the installed CLI package only. `sync` scans
  local transcripts and runs local ingest. `automation` schedules local
  `sync`/`garden`/`update`. Do not add public `capture`, cloud upload, hosted
  connection or login commands without a new agreement. The telemetry exception
  adds no upload/capture command and never transmits wiki or transcript content.
- 2026-06-29: `sync` is a scanner, not a replay ledger. It reads
  `sync_state.last_completed_at`, finds active transcript files, queues ingest
  runs, records the scan as complete, and relies on visible jobs for individual
  ingest success or failure.
- 2026-06-29: `runs` owns lifecycle state transitions. Run records start as
  `queued`, workflows explicitly mark them `running`, and only terminal
  finish calls may move them to `done`, `failed`, or `cancelled`.
- 2026-07-01: `jobs attach` and `jobs cancel` are public control verbs over the
  run ledger. Cancellation is durable run state, not a CLI-side file edit.
  Terminal runs are cancel no-ops; queued or running runs append a `cancelled`
  status event. Terminal finish calls must preserve an already-cancelled run
  rather than rewriting it as done or failed.
- 2026-07-10: Running cancellation is execution control, not a status-only
  write. `__run-worker` manages the serialized queue and starts one hidden
  `__run-executor <run-id>` process per run. A running record stores a verified
  execution id, PID, and process birth time. `jobs cancel` records non-terminal
  cancellation intent, terminates and confirms the matching executor and its
  harness descendants, then appends the terminal `cancelled` event. If process
  termination cannot be confirmed, the run must not claim to be cancelled.
  Queued cancellation remains an atomic terminal transition. Cancellation does
  not roll back edits or commits completed before the process stopped.
- 2026-07-01: Python `jobs attach` streams through a service-owned use case.
  `services/runs/streaming.py` polls `RunStore.attach(...)`, emits only new log
  events, and stops at `done`, `failed`, or `cancelled`; CLI rendering owns
  text and JSON-line output. `jobs logs` remains the snapshot command.
- 2026-07-01: Run persistence is centralized in `codealmanac.db`. `RunStore`
  remains the service-facing persistence facade; `events.py` owns run-event
  sequence writes, `worker_locks.py` owns the worker lock row, and `factory.py`
  owns run-id and initial `RunRecord` construction. Do not regrow per-repository
  run files, JSONL event files, log-path construction, or file-backed queue
  selection.
- 2026-07-01: Queue membership is "queued run with durable `spec_json` in the
  `runs` table." User commands queue a run and spawn a worker. The hidden
  `__run-worker` command is a process entrypoint that calls `RunQueue.drain(...)`;
  it is not a public command and it does not contain lifecycle business logic.
  Do not add parallel foreground/background modes; `jobs attach <run-id>` is the
  public way to follow a run.
- 2026-07-11: Worker shutdown uses an atomic idle handoff. The lock owner
  rechecks durable queue membership and deletes the global worker lock in one
  immediate SQLite transaction. If work exists it keeps ownership and resumes
  draining; do not replace this with polling, sleeps, or a permanent daemon.
- 2026-07-01: `sync` queues eligible transcript ingests and starts the same
  worker path as manual lifecycle commands. Scheduled automation also launches
  ordinary scanner/queue commands rather than a separate sync worker model.
- 2026-07-01: Shared page-writing lifecycle execution belongs to
  `OperationRunner`. Operation workflows such as `ingest` and `garden` prepare
  operation-specific context and prompts, then delegate running-state
  transition, mutation preflight, harness invocation, harness transcript/event
  recording, mutation validation, index refresh, terminal success, and failure
  recording to the page-run workflow. Do not move this harness/run plumbing
  back into individual operation workflows.
- 2026-07-16: Durable operation failure categories come from explicit workflow
  phases, never broad exception classes or traceback-module inference.
  `OperationRunner` owns shared readiness, provider, indexing, wiki-validation,
  and internal phases; operation workflows name only their preparation phases,
  such as ingest `source_preparation`, while delegating the actual failure write
  to the runner.
- 2026-07-16: Harness readiness and provider invocation are separate operation
  stages. After readiness succeeds, adapter exceptions are
  `provider_execution` regardless of exception class; caller event-sink errors
  remain `internal_error`. Failure-event persistence and the authoritative
  terminal transition are independent best-effort effects, so one cannot skip
  the other.
- 2026-07-01: Shared lifecycle helper responsibilities are split behind the
  import-compatible `workflows/lifecycle.py` facade. `lifecycle_mutation.py`
  owns Git/workspace mutation preflight, reported-change validation, path-diff
  comparison, and Almanac-root safety checks. `lifecycle_harness.py` owns
  harness result validation, terminal fallback events, harness-event to
  run-event classification, and first-line failure summaries. Do not regrow
  mutation mechanics or harness classification inside the facade.
- 2026-06-29: Lifecycle workflows record returned harness status/output before
  mutation-safety validation and harness success validation. A failed harness
  run should leave an `output` event in `jobs logs` even when the terminal run
  error is a later safety failure.
- 2026-07-01: The inspectable transcript surface is a CodeAlmanac-owned
  normalized harness event stream, not raw provider transcript files. Port the
  archived harness event model: text, tool use/results, usage, provider
  session, done/failure details, and agent trace events where the provider can
  expose them. Codex should use the Codex app-server harness, not `codex exec`,
  for the main lifecycle path. Claude should use the richer SDK/event harness,
  not only the one-shot CLI print path, when porting archive behavior.
- 2026-07-01: The first rich event-log layer is implemented in Python:
  `HarnessEvent` can carry structured tool display, actor attribution, usage,
  provider session, failure metadata, agent trace, and raw JSON fields, and
  `RunLogEvent` persists an optional nested `harness_event` payload beside the
  readable log row.
- 2026-07-01: The service-owned harness contract is split by product meaning.
  `kinds.py` owns provider/status enums, `actors.py` owns root/helper
  attribution, `events.py` owns normalized transcript event payloads, and
  `results.py` owns readiness, transcript refs, run results, and terminal
  helper events. `models.py` is only an import-compatible facade; do not regrow
  the old mixed model module.
- 2026-07-01: The default Python Codex harness now uses
  `codex app-server --listen stdio://`, not `codex exec`. The adapter keeps
  readiness probing at `codex login status`, but lifecycle execution goes
  through the app-server JSON-RPC client with `mcp_servers={}`, ephemeral
  threads, noninteractive approval/user-input responses, workspace-write
  sandboxing with network disabled, root-turn completion, helper-turn error
  isolation, usage parsing, and normalized text/tool/warning/error/done events.
- 2026-07-01: Codex app-server event normalization is split by provider-edge
  responsibility. `events.py` remains the small notification dispatcher;
  `state.py` owns mutable run state; `actors.py` owns root/helper attribution;
  `item_events.py` owns item and output mapping; `agent_events.py` owns helper
  lifecycle traces; and `result.py` owns provider-session, usage, turn
  completion, and done events. Do not regrow one Codex event monolith.
- 2026-07-01: Codex app-server transport orchestration is split from provider
  policy helpers. `app_server.py` owns process startup, handshake requests,
  JSON-RPC reads, and turn flow. `responses.py` owns noninteractive
  server-request responses; `sandbox.py` owns sandbox mode/env policy and
  payload construction; `turn_completion.py` owns root-turn completion
  detection; `run_result.py` owns `CodexRunState`/failure to
  `HarnessRunResult` projection; and `timeouts.py` owns tolerant timeout-env
  parsing.
- 2026-07-01: Real Codex app-server dogfood proved the installed app-server can
  drive a full local Ingest lifecycle through the Python harness. The run first
  exposed that real `item/agentMessage/delta` notifications may be
  whitespace-only; the provider edge now drops blank text/plan deltas before
  constructing `HarnessEvent` because normalized harness events require
  non-empty messages.
- 2026-07-01: The default Python Claude harness now uses `claude-agent-sdk` for
  lifecycle execution, not `claude -p --output-format json`. The adapter keeps
  readiness probing at `claude auth status` with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` fallback
  when the CLI exists but is not logged in. Runs use isolated SDK options
  (`setting_sources=[]`, `strict_mcp_config=True`, `mcp_servers={}`,
  `permission_mode="dontAsk"`) and map typed SDK messages into normalized
  provider-session, text, tool, usage, helper-agent, error, and done events.
- 2026-07-01: Real Claude SDK dogfood proved the installed SDK and Claude CLI
  auth path can drive a full local Ingest lifecycle through the Python harness.
  The service-level run used `create_app(AppConfig(registry_path=<tmp>))`,
  real HOME/Claude auth, and a temp repo; run
  `ingest-20260701163930-cf193a0e` finished `done`, created
  `release-package-smoke.md`, search found the page, and health was clean.
  Normalized harness events included provider session, text, text deltas,
  tool use/results, context usage, warning, and done.
- 2026-07-01: The default lifecycle harness is Codex. Docs, config defaults,
  setup recommendations, and no-flag lifecycle behavior must agree on that.
- 2026-06-29: Sync pending claims store the run id plus claimed byte/line
  cursor. `sync status` reports active linked runs separately from terminal
  linked runs that need reconciliation. Foreground `sync` reconciles terminal
  linked runs against the run ledger before deciding whether newer transcript
  bytes still need Ingest.
- 2026-06-29: Scheduled sync is ordinary foreground `sync` launched by local
  automation with explicit unattended policy: a stable claim owner, pending
  timeout, and failed-attempt budget. Repeated failed transcript ingests stop
  at needs-attention instead of retrying forever.
- 2026-07-01: Sync orchestration, candidate evaluation, deterministic policy,
  and run execution are separate. `SyncWorkflow` remains the public facade for
  `status`, `run`, and `evaluate`, but it does not own transcript discovery,
  wiki scoping, run-record lookup, candidate evaluation, or execution effects.
  `workflows/sync/evaluation.py` owns transcript discovery, explicit `--wiki`
  scoping, run-record lookup, ledger load/save for pending reconciliation,
  cursor decisions, ready/skipped/attention rows, work-item construction, and
  summary assembly. Do not move these mechanics back into `service.py`.
- 2026-07-01: `workflows/sync/policy.py` remains the facade for deterministic
  sync policy. `decisions.py` owns cursor and pending-run decisions,
  `entries.py` owns ledger-entry transitions, `identity.py` owns
  workspace/session/ledger identity helpers, `snapshots.py` owns transcript
  snapshot reading and hashes, `reporting.py` owns skip/start rows, and
  `guidance.py` owns generated cursor guidance. Policy modules must not import
  provider integrations or service objects.
- 2026-07-01: Sync run execution effects are split from sync selection.
  `workflows/sync/execution.py` owns foreground Ingest execution, background
  queueing, worker-spawn failure handling, pending/failed/absorbed ledger
  writes, and started summary rows. Do not move lifecycle execution effects
  into `service.py` or `evaluation.py`.
- 2026-07-01: Topic read orchestration and topic mutation mechanics are
  separate. `TopicsService` remains the service-facing facade for list/show and
  mutation verbs. `services/topics/mutations.py` owns topic file loading,
  graph invariant checks, page frontmatter topic rewrites, topic-file writes,
  and index refresh after topic writes. Do not move topic YAML or page
  frontmatter rewrite mechanics back into `services/topics/service.py`.
- 2026-07-01: Diagnostics is split by check family. `DiagnosticsService`
  remains the service-facing `doctor` facade. `diagnostics/install.py` owns
  install/runtime/manual-package checks, `diagnostics/wiki.py` owns selected
  wiki readiness checks, and `diagnostics/messages.py` owns shared doctor
  message formatting. Do not move `doctor` mechanics back into `service.py`.
- 2026-07-01: Automation service orchestration is split from scheduler job
  construction. `AutomationService` remains the service-facing install,
  uninstall, and status facade. `services/automation/selection.py` owns task
  defaulting and install-selection validation; `definitions.py` owns static
  task metadata; and `jobs.py` owns `ScheduledJob` construction, command argv,
  plist path, launch PATH, interval, and working-directory resolution. Do not
  move scheduler command construction or selection validation back into
  `service.py`.
- 2026-07-01: Topic service orchestration is split from topic graph mechanics.
  `TopicsService` remains the service-facing use-case entrypoint for list,
  show, create, describe, link, unlink, rename, and delete.
  `services/topics/graph.py` owns topic existence checks, self-parent
  validation, and DAG cycle traversal; `services/topics/read_model.py` owns
  topic slug lookup through the derived index; `services/topics/workspace.py`
  owns current-repo vs explicit-`--wiki` workspace selection. Do not move graph
  traversal, read-model lookup helpers, or `SelectWorkspaceRequest` handling
  back into `service.py`.
- 2026-07-01: Wiki topic YAML handling is split by persistence path.
  `services/wiki/topic_models.py` owns parsed topic models and title defaults;
  `topic_read.py` owns forgiving PyYAML reads for index refresh;
  `topic_file.py` owns ruamel round-trip loading, mutation helpers, and atomic
  writes; and `topics.py` is only the import facade. Do not mix read/index
  tolerance, round-trip mutation mechanics, and topic models in one module.
- 2026-06-29: Source input has four local layers:
  `SourceAddress -> SourceRef -> SourceBrief -> SourceRuntime`. Git source
  runtime uses the Git CLI through a source-runtime adapter. GitHub PR/issue
  runtime uses GitHub CLI through the same port. Transcript runtime uses
  local JSONL parsing through the same port. Web URL runtime uses a local HTTP
  and HTML/text adapter through the same port. Path file/directory runtime uses
  a local filesystem adapter through the same port.
- 2026-07-01: `SourcesService` is the service-facing facade for source verbs.
  It owns resolve/discover/inspect orchestration over request models and ports,
  while `services/sources/address_resolution.py` dispatches source-address
  syntax to source-family modules. Keep runtime adapters and transcript
  discovery adapters out of address resolution.
- 2026-07-01: Source-address resolution is split by address family.
  `address_resolution.py` is the small dispatcher facade; `address_git.py`,
  `address_github.py`, `address_web.py`, `address_path.py`, and
  `address_transcript.py` own family-specific parsing and `SourceBrief`
  construction. `address_hints.py` owns prompt hints, and
  `address_numbers.py` owns shared positive-integer parsing. Do not regrow
  GitHub/web/path/transcript parsing, URL validation, hashing, or prompt hints
  inside the facade.
- 2026-07-01: Transcript source runtime is split by integration
  responsibility. `integrations/sources/transcripts/runtime.py` implements the
  `SourceRuntimeAdapter` port; `models.py` owns typed transcript line and entry
  models; `reader.py` owns JSONL file reading; `entries.py` owns known-provider
  line-to-entry normalization; `rendering.py` owns prompt-facing transcript
  text and tail truncation; `paths.py` owns `SourceRef` path resolution; and
  `errors.py` owns unavailable-runtime diagnostics.
- 2026-06-29: The local viewer's file route is a wiki-reference route:
  `/api/file?path=src/foo.py` returns pages that mention the file or folder
  reference. It does not read or preview repo file contents.
- 2026-06-29: The local viewer renders Markdown through `markdown-it-py` token
  streams. Wikilink rewriting touches text inline tokens only; inline code and
  fenced code stay source text, and labels remain escaped by the renderer.
- 2026-06-29: `serve` should borrow UseAlmanac's visual language, not its
  hosted wiki information architecture. Keep CodeAlmanac's local wiki-first
  reading model: sidebar navigation, page/topic/search/file-reference graph
  movement, and a read-only local viewer over repo-owned pages. UseAlmanac's
  colors, shell polish, account-picker styling, and dashboard chrome are valid
  reference material. Its hosted wiki page list/search flow, account routes,
  billing/settings surfaces, and hosted wording are not the target shape for
  the local product.
- 2026-06-29: Treat the current UseAlmanac wiki page and search experience as
  a non-target reference for CodeAlmanac. The desired direction is the local
  viewer already explored here: persistent sidebar, direct page reading,
  topic/file/search movement, and wiki navigation that feels like a repo-local
  knowledge browser. The earlier CodeAlmanac sidebar shell is the interaction
  target. The design layer can borrow UseAlmanac polish, but the current
  UseAlmanac page list and search treatment should not be copied. The issue is
  not the wiki content model; it is the visual/product treatment around the
  wiki reader.
- 2026-06-29: Bulletproof React is a frontend architecture reference for
  `serve`, not a mandate to add React or Next.js immediately. Apply its
  principles as the viewer grows: feature boundaries, colocated API requests,
  shared UI primitives, direct imports over broad barrels, and browser-level
  tests. A Next.js viewer is allowed only if the static package-data viewer
  becomes harder to maintain than a small built frontend.
- 2026-06-29: The `serve` frontend can use static ES modules while it remains
  a small read-only viewer. `app.js` is the entrypoint; nested modules under
  `server/assets/viewer/` own API calls, hash routes, DOM components, and
  screen renderers. This is the current Bulletproof-inspired seam. Do not add
  React, Next.js, Vite, or a frontend build step until real UI complexity makes
  static package data harder to maintain.
- 2026-06-29: Filesystem directory source runtime uses Git listing when the
  selected directory is inside a Git worktree, then falls back to the bounded
  Python/pathspec walk when Git cannot answer. This is runtime material
  selection, not a new source kind or source catalog.
- 2026-06-29: Git-listed filesystem directory runtime ranks changed and
  untracked files before unchanged files and annotates included files as
  `changed` or `unchanged` in the runtime tree. This is a prompt-material
  selection policy inside the filesystem adapter; it is not a durable
  `candidate` object.
- 2026-06-29: Clean filesystem directory runtime uses semantic diversity
  inside the adapter: after changed/untracked files, bounded selection
  interleaves directory groups and prefers role-bearing files such as
  `service.py`, `adapter.py`, `app.py`, and `main.py`. Do not add a source
  pool, durable candidate object, or Ingest branching for this.
- 2026-07-01: Filesystem source runtime is split by integration
  responsibility. `adapter.py` implements the `SourceRuntimeAdapter` port;
  `documents.py` owns text document models and charset decoding; `listing.py`
  owns directory document assembly and Git-vs-walk source selection;
  `ignore.py` owns default/configured ignore rules and `.gitignore` loading;
  `walk.py` owns Python directory walking; `git.py` owns Git listing/status
  mechanics; `rendering.py` owns prompt-facing runtime text; `paths.py` owns
  shared display/relative path helpers. Keep source selection policy local to
  the filesystem integration unless a second adapter needs the same behavior.
- 2026-07-01: GitHub source runtime is split by integration responsibility.
  `integrations/sources/github/adapter.py` implements the `SourceRuntimeAdapter`
  port; `client.py` owns `gh` process execution and typed payload retrieval;
  `models.py` owns Pydantic `gh --json` payloads; `targets.py` owns
  `SourceRef` to `gh` target arguments; `rendering.py` owns prompt-facing PR
  and issue runtime text; `errors.py` owns unavailable-runtime diagnostics.
- 2026-07-01: Web source runtime is split by integration responsibility.
  `integrations/sources/web/adapter.py` implements the `SourceRuntimeAdapter`
  port; `client.py` owns `httpx` streaming and bounded response reads;
  `models.py` owns typed fetched-response and runtime-document models;
  `documents.py` owns content-type classification, UTF-8 decoding, and
  Beautiful Soup HTML text extraction; `rendering.py` owns prompt-facing
  metadata/content rendering; and `errors.py` owns unavailable-runtime
  diagnostics.
- 2026-07-11: `manual/` is a local support package, not a public CLI surface.
  It contains bundled wiki-maintenance doctrine. `init` copies missing packaged
  manuals into `almanac/manual/` before the build agent starts, preserves
  existing local manual files, and gives build agents exact repository-local
  paths. The reserved `manual/` directory is excluded from wiki page indexing.
- 2026-07-01: Preserve the archived terminal setup experience in Python:
  branded banner, step indicators, raw-mode selection when available,
  non-interactive `--yes`, idempotent setup, agent/default-model selection,
  instruction target installation, local automation choices, and a polished
  next-steps box. Hosted-specific wording must be removed, but the terminal UX
  quality and setup responsibilities remain first-class.
- 2026-07-01: `uninstall` should exist as the reverse of `setup`. It should
  remove setup-owned instructions and scheduler entries idempotently, with
  `--yes` and keep flags where useful.
- 2026-07-01: Setup instruction installation is split by target family behind
  the service-owned `InstructionInstaller` port. `integrations/setup/instructions.py`
  is only the `FileInstructionInstaller` facade and target dispatcher;
  `codex.py` owns Codex AGENTS block selection and cleanup; `claude.py` owns
  Claude guide/import files; `managed_blocks.py` owns marker text transforms;
  `guide.py` owns package resource loading; and `text_files.py` owns narrow
  UTF-8 file reads. Do not move provider marker surgery, package resource
  reads, or target-specific file writes back into `instructions.py`.
- 2026-07-01: Setup service orchestration is split from setup planning and
  automation-policy helpers. `services/setup/service.py` remains the
  `SetupService` facade that calls instruction and config services;
  `planning.py` owns `SetupPlan`, automation recommendations, and next-step
  command construction; and `automation.py` owns setup automation selection.
  Do not move duration formatting or automation recommendation construction
  back into `service.py`. Setup writes one complete user-config update; config
  reconciliation applies its automation policy to the scheduler.
- 2026-07-01: The archive's `review` command family is not required for now.
  The archive's `migrate` command family is not needed unless a concrete
  migration path is reopened.
- 2026-06-29: `database/` owns SQLite connection setup and migration
  application. Product stores still own their SQL schemas and query semantics.
  The current `index.db` migration strategy is rebuild-on-version-change
  because the index is a derived read model from `almanac/**/*.md` and
  `topics.yaml`.
- 2026-07-01: Index read views are split by query family. `IndexStore` remains
  the store facade, `services/index/views.py` remains a small compatibility
  facade, and read-side SQL lives in `search_views.py`, `summary_views.py`,
  `page_views.py`, `topic_views.py`, and health read views. `health_views.py`
  is the `HealthReport` facade; `health_graph_views.py` owns
  page/topic/link/file findings, and `health_source_views.py` owns
  sources/citations findings.
- 2026-07-01: Index write-side responsibilities are split behind `IndexStore`.
  `services/index/schema.py` owns the derived `index.db` schema, migrations,
  and index connection helper; `sources.py` owns page/topic source loading and
  freshness signatures; `projection.py` owns replacement writes and stored
  source signatures. `store.py` stays the service-facing facade.
- 2026-07-14: Search moves from whole-page strict-AND FTS to section-level
  SQLite FTS5 with BM25 ranking. Markdown headings define coherent indexed
  sections; a recall-oriented lexical query admits sections matching meaningful
  terms; page title and section heading receive more weight than body prose;
  and results collapse back to ranked pages while retaining the best matching
  heading and excerpt. The public product remains `search -> show`, Markdown
  remains truth, and SQLite remains rebuildable derived state. Do not add
  semantic retrieval yet. If measured real-repo and benchmark misses repeatedly
  show relevant sections with insufficient lexical overlap, add dense retrieval
  as a second candidate generator and fuse it with lexical results rather than
  replacing exact lexical search.
- 2026-07-10: `config` owns the only configuration file at
  `~/.codealmanac/config.toml`; repository-level `almanac/config.toml` is
  removed. The user config stores auto-commit, harness/model, and enabled/
  interval policy for Sync, Garden, and Update. `config set` persists a value
  and immediately reconciles affected launchd automation; `config apply`
  validates direct TOML edits and reconciles all automation. Public automation
  mutation commands are removed; `automation status` remains actual-state
  inspection. CLI flags still win for one command. No watcher, migration
  reader, compatibility alias, secrets system, or hosted/account config.
- 2026-07-01: Page `sources:` are part of the wiki page model, not just prompt
  guidance. The Python index/read model should parse structured `sources:`,
  project them into SQLite, derive file refs from `sources[type=file]`, expose
  them through `show`/viewer APIs, and let health reason about missing/unused
  citation IDs. This is distinct from ingest source inputs such as paths,
  diffs, PRs, URLs, and transcripts.
- 2026-07-01: Page source address parsing prefers type-specific fields
  (`path:` for `file`, `url:` for `web`, and the documented fields for other
  types), but accepts generic `target:` as a fallback for every source type.
  This keeps the internal `PageSource.target` model aligned with prompt-shaped
  output without making downstream index/search/viewer code know alternate
  frontmatter spellings.
- 2026-07-01: Remove archive/supersede page lineage from the Python product
  model. Git history is the archive. Do not keep `archived_at`,
  `superseded_by`, `supersedes`, `--include-archive`, or `--archived` as
  product concepts unless the user reopens that decision.
- 2026-07-01: `serve` should browse all registered local wikis, matching the
  archive's multi-wiki viewer scope, while keeping the local sidebar/wiki
  reader interaction model.
- 2026-07-01: Viewer service boundaries are split by local-reader
  responsibility. `services/viewer/service.py` remains the use-case facade for
  overview/page/search/file/topic/jobs payloads; `repository_scope.py` owns
  current-repository and `--wiki` selection; `projections.py` owns conversion
  from index/repository models to viewer DTOs. Do not move repository selection
  or DTO construction back into `service.py`.
- 2026-07-01: Server adapter boundaries are split by HTTP-edge
  responsibility. `server/app.py` is the FastAPI composition root only;
  `api_routes.py` owns viewer API route request construction;
  `static_routes.py` owns browser-shell route registration;
  `static_assets.py` owns package asset validation and reads; and `errors.py`
  owns product/Pydantic exception mapping. Do not move route bodies, asset
  loading, or HTTP error mapping back into `app.py`.
- 2026-06-29: The CLI edge is allowed to split by command domain as pressure
  appears. `cli/dispatch/admin.py` is an admin-command facade only;
  `setup.py` owns setup/uninstall request construction, `diagnostics.py` owns
  doctor request construction, `updates.py` owns update request construction,
  `jobs.py` owns jobs request construction, and `automation.py` owns automation
  request construction. The root dispatcher delegates to command-domain edges
  and keeps services/workflows as the product boundary.
- 2026-06-29: The SQLite index service separates projection writes from
  read-only views. `services/index/store.py` stays the service-facing facade;
  `schema.py`, `sources.py`, and `projection.py` own write-side mechanics;
  `services/index/views.py` owns read-only query SQL and row-to-Pydantic view
  construction.
- 2026-06-29: Repository registration lives in the local database. There is no
  `registry.json`, no migration path, and no fallback reader. Repository rows
  are not auto-dropped; unavailable paths are reported or skipped by the command
  that encounters them.
- 2026-07-01: Repository service boundaries are split by repository mechanic.
  `services/repositories/service.py` remains the use-case facade for
  initialization targets, register/get/select/resolve, and path validation.
  `identity.py` owns repository names and ids; `selection.py` owns name matching
  and path containment; `state.py` owns availability classification; `roots.py`
  owns fixed-root validation and direct-root marker checks; and `store.py` owns
  repository persistence in `codealmanac.db`. Do not move selector mechanics,
  id generation, or marker-based status checks back into `service.py`.
- 2026-06-30: An initialized Almanac tree is identified by wiki markers
  (`almanac/README.md` and `almanac/topics.yaml`), not by directory existence.
  Runtime artifacts such as `index.db` and WAL files are derived state. They
  must not make repository status, `doctor`, or read commands treat an
  otherwise missing root as available.
- 2026-06-30: `docs/python-port/next-agent-brief.md` is a load-bearing
  continuation artifact. Public-contract tests discover the newest
  `docs/python-port/slice-N-*.md` file and require the brief's current-state
  section to mention that slice, so future agents do not resume from a stale
  checkpoint after compaction.
- 2026-06-30: Public beta release judgment lives in
  `docs/python-port/public-beta-gate-audit.md`. Slice 70 passed the remaining
  non-toy lifecycle dogfood pass, and slice 71 reran current-head package proof
  after the state-path change. Current remaining release work is operational:
  version, changelog, PyPI credentials, publish ownership, and the human
  publish decision.

## Product Frame

CodeAlmanac maintains a repo-owned wiki for a codebase and the project world
around that codebase. It is not a code documentation generator.

The wiki can cover code, architecture, decisions, incidents, conversations, PR
context, team conventions, deployment constraints, product strategy, and other
durable knowledge that helps future work.

The durable artifact is the repository's `almanac/` tree. Git remains the
system of record for wiki changes.

The Python rewrite is a fresh codebase. Use the old CodeAlmanac implementation
and Almanac's Python engine as references for behavior and structure. Do not
share Almanac's hosted engine as a dependency in v1.

## Repository Shape

Target root:

```text
src/codealmanac/
  app.py
  core/
  database/
  services/
  workflows/
  integrations/
  server/
  cli/
  prompts/
  manual/
```

`app.py` is the composition root. It wires services and integrations through
explicit dependencies.

`core/` holds shared errors, identifiers, path/text helpers, and tiny cross-cutting
models that do not belong to one service.

`database/` owns SQLite connections and migration application.

`services/` holds product nouns:

```text
services/
  repositories/
  wiki/
  index/
  sources/
  runs/
  harnesses/
  automation/
  config/
  diagnostics/
  updates/
  viewer/
```

`workflows/` holds multi-service product verbs:

```text
workflows/
  build/
  ingest/
  garden/
  sync/
```

`integrations/` holds concrete outside-world adapters. Organize adapters by
the service boundary they implement, not as one flat external-tool list.

```text
integrations/
  repositories/
    git/
  harnesses/
    codex/
    claude/
  sources/
    filesystem/
    git/
    github/
    transcripts/
    web/
  automation/
    scheduler/
  updates/
    package.py
```

Ports live near the service that owns the product contract:

```text
services/harnesses/ports.py
services/sources/ports.py
services/automation/ports.py
```

Concrete integrations implement those ports:

```text
integrations/harnesses/codex/adapter.py
integrations/harnesses/claude/adapter.py
integrations/sources/filesystem/adapter.py
integrations/sources/github/adapter.py
integrations/sources/github/client.py
integrations/sources/github/models.py
integrations/sources/transcripts/codex.py
integrations/automation/scheduler/launchd.py
```

Do not put product decisions inside integrations. An integration translates an
outside tool into service-owned models and errors.

`cli/` owns command parsing, rendering, stdout/stderr, and exit codes. It does
not own product decisions.

`manual/` owns bundled wiki-maintenance doctrine. It is read by prompts from
package resources and checked by diagnostics. It does not add a public command.

## Python Service Symmetry

Inside a service package, use these names when needed:

```text
models.py      domain/read models
requests.py    service input contracts
ports.py       adapter protocols
store.py       CRUD/query persistence
records.py     row/model conversion
tables.py      migrations only
service.py     product verbs
```

Do not create empty files just to satisfy symmetry.

SQL belongs in `store.py`, `*_store.py`, or `tables.py`. `tables.py` defines
migrations only. Row conversion belongs in `records.py` or a store-owned helper.

Services own product verbs. Stores own CRUD/query. Integrations implement
service-owned ports. CLI and future hosted/server edges adapt.

Allowed dependency direction:

```text
cli/server
  -> app
    -> workflows
      -> services
        -> stores
        -> ports
          -> integrations
```

Do not make stores call services. Do not make integrations call services. Do
not make CLI contain product decisions.

## Service Ownership

| Service | Owns | Must Not Own |
|---|---|---|
| `repositories` | registered repository rows, exact current-directory selection, `--wiki` name selection, fixed `almanac/` root checks, path containment | page parsing, source discovery, run execution policy |
| `wiki` | markdown page truth, frontmatter, topics, Markdown links, page writes, health inputs | trigger timing, harness execution, source discovery |
| `index` | SQLite read model, FTS, mentions, backlinks, query projections | markdown truth, agent execution |
| `sources` | source observations, source refs, fingerprints, local source state | deciding when AI runs, page writes |
| `runs` | run ledger, events, outputs, lifecycle state transitions | source discovery, page parsing, provider transports |
| `harnesses` | normalized Codex/Claude task/session/event contracts and ports | run lifecycle, page writes, source catalog |
| `automation` | local trigger decisions and scheduler state | run internals, source parsing, provider transports |
| `config` | user config persistence and automation reconciliation | product workflows |
| `diagnostics` | doctor-style checks and readiness reports | mutation workflows |
| `updates` | local package update policy, installer detection, update command planning | scheduler state, hosted release management, package-manager subprocess mechanics |
| `viewer` | read-only local browser payloads, page/topic/search overview assembly, rendered markdown for the viewer | markdown source of truth, SQLite persistence, AI calls, jobs/review lifecycle |

The viewer's product shape is local wiki browsing. It may adopt UseAlmanac's
alpine visual system and shell styling, but it should not replace the existing
wiki sidebar/graph-navigation model with the hosted UseAlmanac wiki page-list
or search flow.

For frontend structure, read `docs/reference/bulletproof-react/CODEALMANAC.md`.
If `serve` remains a static asset bundle, mirror the same boundaries in plain
assets: shared visual primitives, wiki-specific rendering, and API helpers
should stay distinct instead of becoming one unstructured script.

The current static module layout is:

```text
server/assets/app.js
server/assets/viewer/api.js
server/assets/viewer/routes.js
server/assets/viewer/components.js
server/assets/viewer/renderers.js
server/assets/viewer/main.js
```

## Workflows

Workflows coordinate services. They do not own durable schema unless a service
is missing.

`init` creates the initial local wiki at `almanac/` and starts the initial
agent-backed wiki build. It fails when `almanac/` already exists at the target
path. Do not split the user-facing first-build story into a surprising `init`
scaffold plus unrelated `build` index refresh unless the CLI names make that
distinction obvious.

`ingest` updates the wiki from selected local material such as paths, PR refs,
diffs, commit ranges, notes, or transcript refs.

AI-backed ingest must be auditable before it becomes public CLI behavior. The
workflow requires Git change tracking and no non-wiki file mutation during
harness execution. Pre-existing `almanac/` edits are allowed when the user
triggers the run. Dirty application files may exist as source material if their
observed state does not change during the run. Workflows persist normalized
harness events into run logs after the harness returns and before later
validation.

`sync` scans supported local transcript stores for conversations active since
the last completed sync, exact-matches each transcript cwd to a registered
repository root, groups active transcripts by repository, and queues ordinary
local ingest runs. It does not wait for quiet sessions, claim transcript ranges,
or mean cloud sync.

`garden` maintains existing wiki structure, links, topics, stale pages, and page
quality. It may run without new source material.

## Source Model

`source` means raw material CodeAlmanac can learn from. It does not mean
"source of truth."

Authority depends on the claim:

- Code is authoritative for runtime behavior.
- Transcripts are authoritative for what was discussed.
- PRs are authoritative for review context.
- The wiki is the maintained synthesis.

Discovery answers: what material exists or changed?

Use answers: what material should this run use?

There is no durable `candidate` object in v1. Bundling is a run input selection,
not a discovered product entity.

Adding or discovering material does not imply a wiki update. Updating the wiki
is a separate `ingest`, `build`, `sync`, or `garden` workflow.

Page file/folder evidence belongs to `sources:` frontmatter, then to `wiki` and
`index`, not to the source catalog. File sources power mentions search and
health.

## CLI Contract

The v1 CLI is local-only.

```text
codealmanac init [path]
codealmanac setup
codealmanac list
codealmanac search [query]
codealmanac show <page-id>
codealmanac topics
codealmanac health
codealmanac validate
codealmanac serve
codealmanac reindex
codealmanac ingest <inputs...>
codealmanac sync
codealmanac sync status
codealmanac garden
codealmanac automation status
codealmanac jobs
codealmanac jobs attach <run-id>
codealmanac jobs cancel <run-id>
codealmanac doctor
codealmanac update
codealmanac uninstall
```

Commands that need a current repository require the exact current directory to
be a registered repository root, unless the user passes `--wiki <name>`.

There is no `--root` setup option. `almanac/` is the only repo wiki root.

Repository registration lives in `~/.codealmanac/codealmanac.db`.

Use `--wiki <name>` to target a different registered local wiki. Do not add
`codealmanac use <wiki>` in v1; sticky selection is hosted-style state and can
confuse agents.

There is no public `capture` verb. Conversation collection is part of `sync` or
a future explicit local source workflow.

There is no public `absorb` command. The public lifecycle word is `ingest`.

`codealmanac validate` is the explicit correctness gate for agents and lifecycle
runs. It refreshes the derived index, checks links, sources, runtime leakage,
and health findings, and exits nonzero when the wiki has validation issues.

`codealmanac reindex` is the explicit escape hatch for rebuilding the derived
SQLite read model. Query commands may refresh the index implicitly and silently.

`codealmanac sync` accepts local execution controls such as
`--claim-owner`, `--pending-timeout`, and `--max-failed-attempts`. Automation
uses them to make scheduled sync ownership and retry policy explicit.

Public `jobs` is required because background lifecycle execution ships. Internal
`runs` owns records, logs, event streams, outputs, and lifecycle state.
`jobs attach` streams a running job's event log. `jobs cancel` requests
cancellation for queued/running work.

CLI commands are not internal APIs. Automation, workers, tests, and server
wrappers must call the same Python services/workflows that CLI dispatch
calls. They must not shell out to `codealmanac`.

Correct shape:

```python
app.workflows.sync.run(request)
app.workflows.ingest.run(request)
app.runs.record_event(request)
app.viewer.page(request)
```

Incorrect shape:

```python
subprocess.run(["codealmanac", "sync"])
subprocess.run(["codealmanac", "ingest", "..."])
subprocess.run(["codealmanac", "show", "..."])
```

## Feature Map

### MVP

| Area | Features |
|---|---|
| Install/name | `codealmanac` package and command only |
| Repository | exact root selection, `--wiki` name selection, local database registration, path containment |
| Wiki | nested Markdown pages, frontmatter, topics, Markdown links, file/folder sources |
| Index | SQLite read model, FTS search, mentions, backlinks, health |
| Sources | transcript/path/Git/GitHub/web input contracts, local observations, and runtime snapshots |
| Runs/jobs | durable run records, queued specs, events, outputs, attach/cancel |
| Harnesses | Codex app-server and Claude SDK/event harnesses behind normalized ports |
| Workflows | `build`, `ingest`, `sync`, `garden` |
| Automation | local scheduled sync/garden/update |
| CLI | thin local command surface |
| Serve | local read-only wiki viewer |
| Update | foreground and scheduled local package-manager update with conservative source-install refusal |

### Explicitly Out Of Scope For V1

| Area | Decision |
|---|---|
| Hosted product | Do not build hosted shipping now |
| Hosted CLI | No `login`, `connect`, `upload`, hosted `sources`, hosted `jobs` |
| SDK | No Python SDK package |
| MCP | No MCP server |
| Compatibility aliases | No public `almanac`, `alm`, or `absorb` |
| Archive lineage | No `archived_at` / `superseded_by` page state |
| Semantic search | Section-level FTS5/BM25 first; hybrid only after measured lexical-overlap misses |

## Non-Negotiables

- Public naming is `codealmanac`.
- The `almanac/` tree is the repo-owned wiki artifact.
- Global user state lives under `~/.codealmanac/`.
- Local v1 must not inherit hosted assumptions from merged `dev` or `origin/dev`.
- CLI edges stay thin.
- Services own product verbs.
- Stores own persistence.
- Integrations sit behind ports.
- Structured models beat loose dictionaries.
- No hidden `getattr` or dynamic attribute contracts for shaped data.
- No source-kind branches smeared across unrelated services.
- No CLI-shaped core.
- No AI-writing path outside explicit lifecycle workflows.
- SQLite remains the local read model for search, refs, topics, and health.
- File/folder mention queries use normalized paths and GLOB-safe matching.

## Open Decisions

1. Whether local `add` deserves a v1 command or should wait until source-pool
   behavior is concrete.
2. Resolved 2026-07-01: background jobs ship in v1. Public `jobs` returns as
   the inspection/control noun; internal `runs` owns records, events, outputs,
   worker state, and lifecycle transitions.
3. Resolved 2026-06-29: `serve` is restored after the core CLI/read model,
   because the Python index can now support a read-only viewer without a second
   content model.
