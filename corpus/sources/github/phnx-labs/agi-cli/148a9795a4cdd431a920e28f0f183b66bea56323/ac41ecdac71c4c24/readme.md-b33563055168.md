**A framework for running a distributed agent factory.** Dispatch Claude, Codex, Antigravity, Grok, and more across your own machines, in parallel, on your existing subscriptions. Measure every run with `agents insights` (latency lives at `agents insights perf`), fold what you learn back into `AGENTS.md` and skills, then put the loop on a schedule with routines and monitors. Spawn parallel teams in isolated terminals or dispatch to the cloud for a PR. Watch live state across the fleet, nudge stalled runs, and message agents mid-flight. Store secrets behind Touch ID, drive real browsers and Electron apps, and steer the whole fleet from a menu bar — all from one CLI.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install -g @phnx-labs/agents-cli   # or: curl -fsSL agi-cli.sh | sh
agents setup                           # first-time setup, or re-open the capability hub
agents setup status                    # readiness for browser, computer, fleet, and more
agents run claude "explain this repo"  # run any agent on your existing subscription
```

Everything here — and every other command in this README — is free and needs no account; the optional `agents auth login` unlocks the hosted surfaces — [team spaces](#sign-in) and managed trace sync (`agents traces sync` with no Cloudflare setup). `agents setup` is interactive and idempotent -- safe to re-run on any machine. Once core setup exists, it opens a status-aware menu for browser, computer, secrets, fleet, watchdog, and device preferences; each choice delegates to the same wizard available under `agents setup <capability>`. In CI or another non-TTY, bare setup prints the checklist without prompting. The `agi-cli.sh` one-liner installs this same canonical `@phnx-labs/agents-cli` package. Prefer bun? `bun install -g @phnx-labs/agents-cli` works too.

The command surface teaches setup through `agents setup` and group-level `--help`.
The durable system model starts at [`cli/docs/README.md`](cli/docs/README.md).

**What `agents setup` installs, and what auto-updates.** Setup clones a small public
**system repo** (`phnx-labs/.agents-system`) into `~/.agents/.system/`. It ships the
default resources — including **hooks**, which run as shell commands on tool events —
and its checkout **fast-forwards from its origin** when you run `agents use` (and, only
if you opt in with `AGENTS_AUTO_PULL=1`, in the background). Two safeguards bound that:
the pull is `merge --ff-only` (it can never rewrite your local history), and it is
**verified against the expected origin** — a checkout whose `origin` is not the canonical
system repo (or the exact repo you named in `AGENTS_SYSTEM_REPO`) is refused, never
pulled, so a repointed remote cannot slip hook code onto your machine. To pin or opt out:
set `AGENTS_SYSTEM_REPO=gh:you/your-fork` to track your own audited copy, run
`agents setup --no-system-repo` to skip the clone entirely, or check out a specific tag
in `~/.agents/.system/` (a fast-forward only advances a moving branch, so a detached tag
stays put).

Also: [harness engineering](https://agi-cli.sh/learn/harness-engineering) · [visual longform](https://share.agents-cli.sh/muqsitnawaz/agents-loop-and-graph-engineering).

Already installed? `agents upgrade` updates agi-cli itself to the latest version (`agents upgrade 1.2.3` for a specific version or dist-tag, `-y` to skip the confirm prompt). The command is `upgrade` on every platform -- do not reach for `agents update`, which updates an installed **agent harness**, not agi-cli (and on macOS, `agents helper update` is a third thing: it reinstalls the keychain helper).

## Factory loop

The same loop whether it's one agent on your laptop or a fleet across a dozen machines: dispatch work, measure what happened, fold the lesson back into the harness, then put it on a schedule.

```bash
# Dispatch a team across the fleet -- each teammate in its own worktree
agents teams create checkout --devices yosemite-s0,yosemite-s1
agents teams add checkout claude "Owns: app/payments/*" --name payments
agents teams add checkout codex  "Write tests for the new code" --name qa --after payments
agents teams start checkout --watch

# Measure what happened -- latency, friction, dead-weight skills
agents insights perf commands --days 7   # slowest CLI entrypoints
agents insights --since 30d        # friction, harness comparison, ranked actions

# Fold the lesson back into the harness -- every agent picks it up next run
agents rules add ~/lessons/payments-review.md --agents claude
agents skills add ~/skills/payments-review --agents claude

# Put it on a schedule so it runs itself
agents routines add nightly-payments-audit \
  --schedule "0 2 * * *" --agent claude --prompt "Audit payments/* for regressions"

# Steer the fleet this loop runs on from the menu bar
agents menubar setup
```

`agents insights perf` reads a disposable warehouse at `~/.agents/.cache/perf/perf.db` -- hook, command, and run timing rollups, deletable any time. `agents insights` (alias `agents sessions insights`) is deterministic and offline: it caches per-session facets, compares harnesses, and ranks actions by evidence count -- no model call unless you pass `--narrative`. Routines put any of this on a cron ([Routines](#routines)); monitors fire it on a change instead of a clock ([Monitors](#monitors)); the menu bar is the always-on control surface for the fleet these commands drive ([Menu bar](#menu-bar)).

---

## One config, every agent

```bash
# Set up the Notion MCP server once.
agents install mcp:com.notion/mcp

# It's now registered with Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, and Cursor.
agents mcp list
```

Skills, slash commands, rules, hooks, and permissions work the same way -- install once in `~/.agents/`, synced to every agent's native format automatically.

A schema-v3 `agent.yaml` package materializes into an ephemeral Claude, Codex, or OpenCode home for Factory / Prix Cloud workers (`agents packages materialize ./reviewer --harness codex --harness-version 0.42.0 --output-home "$OUTPUT_HOME" --json`) -- it never writes the live user home.

```bash
agents skills add gh:yourteam/python-expert     # Knowledge pack -> all agents
agents commands add gh:yourteam/commands         # Slash commands -> all agents
agents rules add gh:team/rules                   # AGENTS.md -> per-agent instruction files
agents permissions add ./perms                   # Permissions -> auto-converted per agent
```

Write one `AGENTS.md`. It becomes `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `AGENTS.md` for Antigravity, and `.cursorrules` for Cursor.

---

## Run any agent

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/run-agent.svg" alt="agents run: one command runs any harness (claude/codex/antigravity) against the project-pinned version, with an automatic rate-limit fallback chain." width="100%" />
</p>


```bash
agents run claude "Find all auth vulnerabilities in src/"
agents run codex "Fix the issues Claude found"
agents run antigravity "Write tests for the fixed code"
```

Each resolves to the project-pinned version with skills, MCP servers, and permissions already synced. Single-typo names auto-correct across every command — `agents view cladue` resolves to `claude`, `agents add codx@latest` to `codex`.

`agents run claude "task" --lease` reuses one shared warm crabbox pool across
repositories by default. Concurrent runs share the box but execute in isolated
`~/workspaces/<repo>-<run>` directories with separate agent homes and credential
files. Add `leaseProfile: private-hot-box` to
`.crabbox.yaml` only when a repo intentionally needs a dedicated warm pool;
cross-repo reuse trades re-sync latency for lower idle-compute cost.

### Rate-limited? Keep working.

```bash
# Claude Code hits a rate limit -> Codex picks up automatically. Same project, same config.
agents run claude "refactor auth module" --mode edit --fallback codex,antigravity
```

### Multiple accounts? Spread the load.

```bash
# Picks the signed-in account you haven't used recently.
agents run claude "summarize recent commits" --strategy balanced

# Or choose one account/version interactively for only this run (# = account picker).
agents run claude#
agents run codex# "review this branch"
agents run claude# --device auto        # pick the device, then choose there
agents run claude# --device yosemite-s0 # choose from one device's accounts

# @ picks the device instead; #@ asks both (account first, then device).
agents run claude@                      # pick the device for this run
agents run claude#@                     # pick the account, then the device
```

`--strategy balanced` spreads work across available versions of the same agent -- useful when you have multiple accounts and want to avoid burning through one. When a Claude run reports a session limit, agents-cli records the stated reset time, shows `session-limited` in `agents view`, and excludes that account until the reset. When every account is rate-limited, the run exits nonzero naming each excluded account and the earliest window reset (use `--strategy pinned` to force a rate-limited default) -- it never launches into an exhausted account. A logged-out default is never forced: unpinned dispatch picks a signed-in version on the execution device instead of dying on a credential-less default home.

### Don't care which harness? `agents run auto`

```bash
# Picks the host (14d usage affinity), the harness (installed CLIs weighted by
# best-account headroom), and the account (balanced) -- all three layers.
agents run auto "summarize recent commits"
agents run auto --device yosemite-s0 "fix the flaky test"   # pin the host layer
```

`run auto` excludes any harness whose accounts are all rate-limited or signed out, and exits nonzero with the earliest reset time when nothing anywhere is healthy.

A trailing `@` opens an account picker before either an interactive or prompt-based run. Each installed version shows its account identity, exact version, login state, plan, and every available session, weekly, or monthly limit. Logged-out, rate-limited, and out-of-credit accounts remain visible with the reason they cannot be selected; signed-in accounts whose provider does not expose quota data stay selectable and say `limits unavailable`. The choice pins only that run and does not change your default version.

Account selection is available for Claude, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, Antigravity, Grok, Kimi, Droid, and OpenCode. It requires a terminal and cannot be combined with `--resume`, `--strategy`/`--balanced`, `--lease`, or a warm-box lease. Device routing is resolved first, then the picker is populated from the selected device. Profiles and workflows must use their concrete host agent instead.

### Chain agents

```bash
agents run claude "Review PRs merged this week, summarize risks" \
  | agents run codex "Write regression tests for the top 3 risks"
```

Supports plan (read-only), edit, auto, and skip modes, effort levels, JSON output for scripting, and timeout limits.

### What does `--mode skip` actually do?

Treat `skip` as a last-resort escape hatch. In direct-exec runs (without `--acp`),
agi-cli forwards the harness's native no-prompt flag; it does not add another
safety layer. Prefer `auto` where it adds a safer automatic policy (smart classifier
on Claude/Copilot, never-prompt over a sandbox on Codex, native high-auto mode on
Droid, or interactive Kimi), or `edit` everywhere else. For headless Kimi, `edit`, `auto`, and `skip` all use the same
already-auto-approved `-p` behavior, so prefer `edit` rather than signaling a blanket
bypass. Harnesses without a native bypass flag reject direct-exec `skip`.

| Harness | Direct-exec `--mode skip` becomes |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` |
| Codex | `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` (equivalent to `--yolo`) |
| Gemini | `--yolo` |
| Cursor | `-f` |
| OpenClaw | `--mode full` |
| GitHub Copilot | `--allow-all` (alias: `--yolo`) |
| Antigravity | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` |
| Grok | `--always-approve` |
| Kimi | `--yolo` interactively; no extra flag in headless `-p` runs, which already auto-approve |
| Droid | `--skip-permissions-unsafe` |

With `--acp`, these native flags are not used. agi-cli instead grants `skip`
permission requests at the ACP protocol layer: it selects `allow_always` when offered,
otherwise the first permission option offered by the server. The same last-resort
warning applies.

Codex has three managed permission profiles rather than a smart classifier. `edit`
and `auto` share one sandbox — the workspace, `~/.agents`, and regenerable toolchain
caches are writable, and network access is enabled — and differ only in approvals:
`edit` requests them on demand, while `auto` never prompts, so a sandbox-denied
command fails and the agent works around it instead of stopping on a dialog nobody
is watching. When `--mode` is omitted for Codex, `edit` is used. An explicit
`--mode plan` keeps the filesystem read-only while leaving network access on.
`agents run codex --mode skip` is different:
it bypasses approvals **and** removes the sandbox. `full` remains an alias for `skip`,
but new scripts should use the explicit `skip` name.

### One protocol, every harness

```bash
# Typed event stream instead of raw stdout. Same command, any supported agent.
agents run claude "review this diff" --acp --json
```

`--acp` routes through the [Agent Client Protocol](https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol) so you get a unified event stream -- `agent_message_chunk`, `tool_call`, `plan_update`, `stop_reason` -- instead of writing a parser per CLI. File writes and shell commands flow through agi-cli, which means `--mode plan` becomes a real sandbox: the write RPC is denied, not just unused.

ACP adapters are documented for claude, codex, cursor, opencode, openclaw, and grok. Other harnesses keep running on the direct-exec path.

## Sessions across agents

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/sessions.svg" alt="agents sessions: search transcripts across Claude, Codex, legacy Gemini, and OpenCode at once, plus a live --active panel showing each running session's state (working / waiting / idle)." width="100%" />
</p>


When you run multiple agents, conversations scatter across tools. Session search brings them together.

```bash
# Where was that auth conversation? Search Claude Code, Codex, legacy Gemini, OpenCode at once.
agents sessions "auth middleware"

# Filter by agent, project, or time window
agents sessions --agent codex --since 7d
agents sessions --project my-app

# Read a full conversation
agents sessions a1b2c3d4 --markdown

# Render a shareable, redacted Markdown transcript with the session preview on top
agents sessions render a1b2c3d4 -o session.md

# Or publish it as a link in one step (unlisted + redacted by default)
agents sessions share a1b2c3d4

# Visualize a session as a trajectory -- tool-call waterfall, timing, stalls, errors
agents trace a1b2c3d4                    # opens the HTML (a person at a terminal)
agents trace a1b2c3d4 --text --errors-only   # compact text an agent reads in-context
agents sessions trace a1b2c3d4 --json    # the versioned sessions-trace envelope

# Just the last 3 turns, user messages only
agents sessions a1b2c3d4 --last 3 --include user

# Calls in recent Codex sessions on one device
agents sessions --include tools --agent codex --device mac-mini --since 7d

# One session where two different calls match; query every online device
agents sessions --include tools \
  --query 'program:git input:merge' \
  --query 'program:gh output:CONFLICT' \
  --fleet --json

# Count pre-indexed static git sites, containing calls, and sessions
agents sessions --include tools --query 'program:git' --count --fleet --json

# Populate historical tool rows once on each device
agents sessions backfill tools --fleet

# Which skills/commands you actually invoke -- and which installed ones are dead weight
agents sessions stats
agents sessions stats --zero            # only the never-invoked (dead weight)
agents sessions backfill resources      # fold historical sessions into the usage index

# Friction, owner corrections, repeated recipes, and ranked actions across harnesses
agents sessions insights --since 30d
agents sessions insights --agent claude --agent codex --json
# Top-level alias
agents insights --since 7d
```

`sessions insights` is deterministic and offline by default. It caches per-session facets, compares harnesses, and emits an actions table with evidence counts plus shortened sample session ids. `--narrative` is opt-in and receives aggregates only, never raw transcripts.

Interactive picker when you're in a terminal. Structured output (`--json`, `--markdown`, filtered by role or turn count) when piped.

Backed by a SQLite + FTS5 index at `~/.agents/.history/sessions/sessions.db` with incremental scanning -- warm reads in ~100ms. Tool-call evidence is redacted and bounded before it is cached; repeated `--query` clauses must match distinct calls in one session. Tool queries read SQLite only: `agents sessions backfill tools` performs the one-time historical parse, while normal incremental scans index new and changed sessions. The index stores ordered static Bash program sites, so `--count` reports occurrences, containing tool calls, and distinct sessions without reparsing. `--fleet` executes one origin partition per device, so synced mirrors cannot duplicate compact evidence or counts returned over SSH; transcript bodies stay on their origin machine. This uses relational SQLite rows and literal FTS5 only, with no embeddings, vector database, or model calls. External tools can consume `--json` output as a programmatic observability layer; see [docs/sessions.md](cli/docs/sessions.md) for the schemas and [docs/observability.md](cli/docs/observability.md) for the consumption patterns.

### Live state, and catching up fast

Search is the past tense. `--active` is the present -- it infers what each running session is *doing right now* from the tail of its transcript.

```bash
agents sessions --active            # every live run across the fleet, with state
agents sessions --working           # actively producing work (fleet-wide)
agents sessions --idle              # stopped between turns (fleet-wide)
agents sessions --orphan            # agent outlived its terminal client
agents sessions --crashed           # terminal and agent disappeared uncleanly
agents sessions resume a1b2c3d4     # jump back into one — attach in place, or recover
agents sessions resume ag-claude-a1b2c3d4  # or by its tmux alias
```

On a terminal, `agents sessions --active` (and a bare `agents sessions`) open the **interactive session browser** — one filter you drive with single keys, re-pulled live across the fleet:

| key | filters by | flag it mirrors |
|---|---|---|
| `s` | search text | `--query` / positional |
| `r` | running only | `--active` |
| `b` | bookmarks only | `--bookmarks` |
| `*` | bookmark / unbookmark the highlighted session | `agents sessions bookmark <id>` |
| `f` | focus the highlighted session | `agents sessions resume <id>` |
| `c` | team sessions | `--team` (alias: `--teams`) |
| `a` | agent (cycles) | `-a` |
| `d` | device (cycles) | `--device` |
| `p` | this repo ↔ all dirs | `--all` |
| `w` | time window | `--since` |
| `tab` | toggle the preview pane | — |
| `⏎` | resume / attach | `resume` / `focus` |
| `y` | copy the equivalent command | `--print-cmd` |

**Bookmark the sessions you keep coming back to.** `*` marks the highlighted row (a `★` shows in the listing), `b` narrows to bookmarks, and `agents sessions bookmark <id>` / `--bookmarks` do the same outside a TTY. Press `f` to focus the highlighted row through the same attach-or-recover flow as `agents sessions resume <id>`; Enter keeps its existing resume behavior. Bookmarks live in `~/.agents/.history/bookmarks.json` keyed by session id, so they survive a reindex of the session cache. They're per-machine — session sync carries transcripts, not this file.

**A session that lost its host says so.** When an editor window or an SSH connection goes down hard, the agent it owned used to simply disappear from `--active`; when an agent outlived its window in tmux, it reported a plain `idle`. Both now carry their own status: `✗ crashed` (the host went down and took the agent with it) and `◍ orphan` (still alive, but no client is attached — nothing is showing it). Read from tmux's attached-client count and the editor window's registry heartbeat, so a deliberate `agents sessions detach` is never mistaken for one, and a session that is still *working* headlessly is left alone.

Filters **stack** (they AND together), the active set shows in the header, and the highlighted row **previews below by default** (`tab` hides it) — prompt, activity, last response, plus a links line where the worked-on ticket and the PR the session opened are **clickable** (OSC 8 hyperlinks: the ticket jumps to Linear, the `PR#` to GitHub, in terminals that support them). The Linear workspace is resolved from `LINEAR_WORKSPACE` or the linear-cli config, so tickets stay plain text when it's unknown. Because every hotkey has a flag, the view you build by hand is a real command: press `y` (or run `--print-cmd`) to get the exact `ag sessions …` line — explore interactively, hand the line to an agent. Piped output, `--json`, or `--no-interactive` keep the plain listing for scripts. Peek without opening the pager with `agents sessions preview <uuid-or-8-char-id>`; it resolves across the fleet and supports `--json`. The older `agents sessions <id> --preview` spelling remains available.

| before — preview hidden | after — preview open + clickable links |
| --- | --- |
| ![sessions browser, preview hidden](assets/demos/sessions-preview-before.png) | ![sessions browser, preview open with a links line](assets/demos/sessions-preview-after.png) |

Each live session resolves to `working`, `waiting_input` (with why -- a question, a plan review, or a permission prompt), `idle`, or a lifecycle state such as `orphaned`, `crashed`, `closed`, `abandoned`, `queued`, or `unknown`. Pass the matching flag (`--working`, `--idle`, `--waiting`, `--orphan`, `--crashed`, `--closed`, `--abandoned`, `--queued`, `--unknown`) directly; each implies `--active`, and several flags form a union. The fleet fan-out is already the default; `--local` opts out. `--all` instead widens historical directory and time scope. Rows also carry badges for the PR, worktree, and ticket. `agents sessions resume [selector]` accepts the same agent/version, device, time, team, project, skill/plugin, bookmark, and live-state filters as the session browser. A unique id or `ag-<agent>-<shortid>` tmux alias resolves directly; an agent/version or text selector always opens the preview picker. Immediately before attach it checks the tmux pane process: a living pane is joined in place, while a dead/missing pane enters recovery instead of showing tmux's `Pane is dead` screen.

Landing on a session cold? `agents sessions <id>` prints a catch-up digest: an inferred title, files changed grouped by directory (created / modified / deleted), a histogram of which tools did the work (including parsed Bash commands -- `git`, `npm`, `ffmpeg`, `ssh`, and so on), and the last test verdict -- the signals to reload a task in seconds.

Sharing a session uses `agents sessions render <id> -o session.md`, not the raw harness JSONL. The document starts with that same preview, then presents user and assistant turns, fenced commands, structured tool arguments, and bounded tool output. Credential-shaped values and local home paths are redacted by default; `--no-redact` is for local-only inspection.

`agents sessions share <id>` goes one step further and publishes that document as a self-contained web page on your own share endpoint, printing the link. It is **unlisted** unless you pass `--public` — a transcript carries file paths, command output, and error text that a plan does not, so it stays out of your public gallery by default, and emails are masked on top of the render's own redaction. The slug is `session-<shortId>`, so re-sharing one session updates one URL.

### Back up sessions off-box

Signed-in Phoenix users can back sessions up without creating a Cloudflare bucket or
an `r2.backups` secrets bundle:

```bash
agents sessions export --since 30d --to-r2
agents sessions import --from-r2 --dry-run
agents sessions import --from-r2
```

The managed path encrypts every transcript body locally with AES-256-GCM before
upload. Its per-account key is escrowed behind the same Phoenix bearer so another
signed-in device can restore with zero setup. This protects transcript contents from
a raw storage-bucket read, but it is not zero-knowledge against Phoenix because
Phoenix-operated infrastructure stores the recovery key. Use `--byo` with your own
`r2.backups` bundle and `R2_SYNC_ENC_KEY` when Phoenix must never possess the key:

```bash
agents sessions export --since 30d --to-r2 --byo
agents sessions import --from-r2 --byo
```

Both targets are on-demand backups only; neither enables background session sync.

### Resume anywhere — and stay resumed

Omit the session ID to choose from an interactive history picker with descriptions
and conversation previews. These commands use the same picker and account filter:

```bash
ag run claude --resume
agents sessions resume --agent claude

ag run claude#work --resume
agents sessions resume --agent claude --account work
```

Resume restores the conversation's account, model, mode and working directory with
the currently installed harness. Updating that binary does not select a different
account. `agents sessions resume <id> --vscodium` opens the selected conversation in
VSCodium. If only archived context remains, the CLI asks before starting a new
conversation from it; a missing transcript fails before launching an agent.


Pick up any past conversation and drop it back into a terminal:

```bash
agents sessions resume                     # multi-select; packs two sessions per tab
agents sessions resume "auth middleware"   # pre-filter the pool, then choose
agents sessions resume --tmux              # into persistent tmux — survives editor restarts
agents sessions resume --device zion --tmux  # resume on another machine over SSH
agents sessions resume 019fd0c8-b3e9-77a2-a1a4-444698c4d897  # original harness/version/device/mode
agents run auto --resume 019fd0c8-b3e9-77a2-a1a4-444698c4d897  # adapt if its account is unavailable
```

`agents sessions resume` reopens several sessions in whatever terminal you're in -- auto-detected across iTerm, Ghostty, tmux, and the VSCodium agent-terminal, or forced with `--iterm` / `--ghostty` / `--tmux` / `--vscodium`. `agents sessions resume <id>` resumes one session without requiring you to name its harness: exact IDs take a local SQLite fast path, then resolve fleet-wide and recover on the source device. If the origin version is installed, signed in, healthy, and still owns the indexed transcript, its isolated home performs native resume. Claude launches that native resume from the original project directory recorded before the first turn, so its `projects/<cwd-key>` lookup reaches the conversation even when the session later changed directories. When that origin login is usage-limited but the home still owns the transcript, resume stays native and rotates to a healthy injectable provider account of the **same harness**. `/continue <id>` is the last-resort fallback — a signed-out, revoked, trashed, backup-only, or same-number-reinstalled origin, or a limited origin whose transcript is no longer in that home — and still authenticates as a healthy same-harness account (injecting a provider credential when that is the pick, so it never launches the exhausted native login). It never native-resumes from a different isolated home. Back them with **tmux** and the runs turn durable: detach, close your editor, reboot the GUI -- the session is still alive to `agents tmux attach`. The whole `agents tmux` subsystem (persistent multiplexer sessions that survive editor restarts and can be shared with other tools) sits underneath.

### Send an agent to the background — and bring it back

Running 30 agents and drowning in terminal tabs? `agents sessions detach <id>` stops a session's interactive process and keeps it working **headless** in the background -- it drives its task to done unattended, no tab, lower cost. `agents sessions resume <id>` brings it back through the same origin-device recovery decision: native resume in the owned account home, or an explicitly chosen same-harness `/continue` replay when native context is unavailable.

```
agents sessions detach a1b2c3d4     # go headless in the background, keep working
agents sessions resume a1b2c3d4     # bring it back interactively, right here
```

Both are agent-agnostic -- they route through the same `agents run --resume` path (native resume for Claude/Codex, `/continue` replay for the rest). `agents sessions --active` shows each session's **owner** (the human who launched it, resolved from the tailnet identity, or `-` for an unresolved local run) and its `presence` -- `attached` (you're watching it), `background` (running headless), or `parked` (its background run finished) -- so the menu bar and AGI EXT show who is running what, and where. In AGI EXT, **Agents: Detach** (`Cmd/Ctrl+K B`) and **Agents: Attach** (`Cmd/Ctrl+K A`) do the same over the focused terminal.

## Control the fleet

Running agents aren't fire-and-forget. Steer them mid-run without opening their terminals.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/fleet-control.svg" alt="agents sessions infers live state (working, waiting, idle); watchdog injects Continue into the exact stalled split; message reaches a running agent at its next tool call" width="100%" />
</p>

### Message a running agent

```bash
# Delivered at the agent's next tool call — no restart, no lost context.
agents message tester "also cover the null case"
```

`agents message <target> <text>` reaches any running agent by name or id -- a live local run, a teammate, a loop agent, or a cloud task -- and the text lands at its next tool call. Tag the sender with `--from <who>`.

### See every open block

```bash
agents feed                         # grouped by outcome (ticket/PR/worktree) across the fleet
agents feed --flat                  # one row per agent (legacy)
agents feed --device mac-mini         # scope the view to one or more hosts
agents feed --local                 # skip the SSH fan-out
agents feed --json                  # blocks stamped with their outcome key
agents feed watch --json            # versioned agents + attention + activity NDJSON
agents feed answer <key> --choice 0 # first answer wins; route over the recorded reply rail
agents feed post --title "Halfway done" "CI green, watching merge"  # title + body
```

Important posts can reach every owner channel named in
`~/.agents/humans.yaml` under `owner.policy.normal` (for example iMessage and
Slack). Owner delivery attempts every selected channel, reports partial
failures, and safely forwards Rush-backed channels from headless workers to a
capable Mac; ordinary milestone posts remain record-only unless configured.

An optional **per-session summarizer** (off by default) adds a daemon-computed
`goal`, progress `checkpoints`, and a detailed `summaryChecklist` to each session
row on the `feed watch` / `sessions watch` stream. It never runs on a request
path — the model call lives in a background daemon service, cached per transcript
so it never recomputes on unchanged bytes. Turn it on with a local model endpoint:

```bash
agents config set summarizer.enabled on
agents config set summarizer.baseUrl http://localhost:11434   # Ollama / vLLM / LiteLLM
agents config set summarizer.model qwen2.5:3b
```

Top-level questions and waiting notifications publish one atomic open-block record per session, including the mailbox id, host, runtime, and every answer option. The default view collapses agents under the **outcome** they serve (Linear ticket, PR, worktree slug, or Unassigned) so a 1,100-agent fleet reads as dozens of deliverables. Answered, resumed, and stopped blocks clear automatically; Task subagents are excluded. The rendered reply command uses the same mailbox id with `agents message`, so the decision routes back to the agent that asked it.

### Auto-nudge stalls

```bash
agents watchdog            # one tick, dry run — reports what it WOULD nudge and why
agents watchdog --verbose  # include healthy/non-actionable session inspections
agents watchdog --nudge    # actually inject "Continue." into the stalled split
agents watchdog --watch    # daemon loop: a tick every --interval
```

`agents watchdog` detects a stalled session, resolves the *exact* terminal split it lives in (tmux, iTerm, VSCodium, or a raw pty), and injects a nudge -- `Continue.` by default, or set `--text`. Its timestamped default output shows attention-worthy sessions with their agent, host app, machine, project, activity, age, path, latest preview, and decision reason; `--verbose` restores healthy/non-actionable inspections. It's dry by default; `--nudge` acts on a single tick. `agents watchdog enable|disable` controls the device-local daemon pass, which runs once every three minutes. Steer a single run with `agents watchdog policy <id> off | keep | handsoff`.

A stalled session whose tail shows a hard account limit ("You've hit your weekly limit · resets …") is **rotated in place** instead of nudged: the watchdog gates on the same healthy-account selection `agents run auto` makes (zero healthy → one skip event per cooldown window, terminal untouched), injects the harness's exit sequence, relaunches `agents run auto --interactive --session-id <uuid>` in the *same* tab, then replays the old session's resume once the new TUI is live. Default on; `agents watchdog rotate off` disables it (nudging stays on).

## Sync the fleet

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/fleet-sync.svg" alt="agents fleet apply: reconcile every device to one profile from agents.yaml — install missing agents and sync config. Native logins stay on the machine that minted them." width="100%" />
</p>


One machine is set up the way you like it. Make every other machine match -- same agents installed, same config -- in one command. Native OAuth logins stay on the box that minted them; portable provider accounts move only via `agents accounts sync`.

```yaml
# agents.yaml -- add a fleet: block
fleet:
  devices: all              # every online registered device (minus this one)
  defaults:
    agents: [claude@latest, codex@latest, antigravity@latest]
    sync: [user]            # config scopes to reconcile
    login: sync             # surface needs-login; never copies native OAuth
```

```bash
agents fleet apply --plan                 # device x dimension matrix; changes nothing
agents fleet apply                        # reconcile the fleet (confirms first; -y to skip)
agents fleet apply --device yosemite-s0   # scope to one device
agents fleet apply --only agents,config   # limit dimensions (agents, config, login)
agents fleet apply --no-login             # skip login propagation
```

`agents fleet apply` probes every target over the existing SSH transport, then reconciles it to the profile: installs missing agents, upgrades `agi-cli`, syncs the named config scopes, and **propagates logins** so a host signed in once seeds the fleet -- turning "6 hosts x 8 harnesses = 48 OAuth flows" into one. Portable credential files (claude, codex, grok, kimi, opencode, droid, antigravity) stream to each target over encrypted SSH stdin, never shell-interpolated, and land at `0600`. **Honest boundary:** macOS keychain-bound tokens (claude, antigravity on a Mac target) can't be extracted -- those surface as a one-time manual login, never faked. `--plan` / `--dry-run` shows the full matrix without touching anything.

See [docs/fleet.md](cli/docs/fleet.md) for the manifest schema and reconcile semantics.

---

## Pin versions per project

```bash
# This project needs claude@2.0.65 -- newer versions changed tool calling.
agents use claude@2.0.65 -p

# The monorepo uses codex@0.116.0 across the team.
agents use codex@0.116.0 -p
```

This creates an `agents.yaml` at the project root:

```yaml
# agents.yaml (commit this to your repo)
agents:
  claude: "2.0.65"
  codex: "0.116.0"
```

Think `requirements.txt` for CLI coding agents, on steroids. A shim reads `agents.yaml` from the project root and routes `claude` / `codex` / `antigravity` / `grok` (and others) to the right version automatically. Each version gets its own isolated home -- switching backs up config and re-syncs resources.

```bash
agents add claude             # Install the one managed installation (taught form)
agents add claude@2.0.65     # Pin that installation to a specific release (expert)
agents add codex@latest       # Latest published release
agents view                   # See everything installed
agents accounts add claude work   # headed: login + worker credential + sync
agents run claude#work
```

Multiple provider accounts to juggle? See [Accounts](#accounts) below.

---

## Run open models through Claude Code (experimental)

> **Note:** Profiles are experimental, but available by default — no enable step needed.

```bash
# Kimi K2.5 responding inside Claude Code's UI, tools, and skills.
# No proxy server. No LiteLLM. One OpenRouter key, stored in Keychain.
agents harness add kimi
agents run kimi "refactor this file"
```

Built-in presets (all via OpenRouter, one shared key):

| Preset | Model | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `kimi` | Kimi K2.5 | #1 HumanEval. Reasoning -- interactive only. |
| `minimax` | MiniMax M2.5 | #1 SWE-bench Verified. Reasoning. |
| `glm` | GLM 5 | #1 Chatbot Arena (open-weight). |
| `qwen` | Qwen3 Coder Next | Latest coding Qwen. Print-safe. |
| `deepseek` | DeepSeek Chat V3 | Latest non-reasoning. Print-safe. |

A profile swaps the model while keeping Claude Code as the agent runtime -- same UI, slash commands, skills, MCP tools. Under the hood: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` + `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, auth from Keychain at spawn time.

Custom endpoints (Ollama, vLLM) work too -- drop a YAML in `~/.agents/profiles/`:

```yaml
name: local-qwen
host: { agent: claude }
env:
  ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL: https://ollama.example.com
  ANTHROPIC_MODEL: qwen3.6:35b
auth:
  envVar: ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN
  keychainItem: agents-cli.ollama.token
```

Profile YAML has no secrets -- safe to `agents repo push` to a shared repo. `agents harness list` lists the full catalog.

---

## Named routers

A **router** is a reusable, task-typed allowlist -- which harnesses, which models/tiers per harness, and which linked accounts a task may be routed to. It's a generalization of a profile: a profile is a router pinned to one harness and one account.

```bash
# Scope a router to two harnesses, capped at a tier
agents route add research --harness gemini,kimi --tier cheap,default   # alias: create

# Narrow one harness's model set
agents route allow research kimi kimi-k2

# Only these accounts are eligible when routing under this router
agents route link-account research gemini personal
agents route link-account research kimi work

agents route view research        # alias: show
agents route rename research prod  # rename a router, preserving its config
agents route list --json
```

Router YAML has no secrets -- safe to `agents repo push` to a shared repo. Harness ids and model/tier tokens are validated on `add`/`allow`: an unknown harness or an unverifiable model id fails loud and writes nothing. Routers resolve as a layered resource (project > user > system, same as profiles). The old verbs `create`/`show` remain as aliases.

## Run on your own machines

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/hosts.svg" alt="agents hosts: dispatch agents run and config commands to another machine over plain SSH (no daemon); the Tailscale fleet is auto-discovered." width="100%" />

Dispatch any read-only or config command -- and `agents run` itself -- to another machine over SSH. No daemon.

```

`agents devices list` shows normalized load, memory pressure, and an
idle/light/busy/loaded headroom badge, plus a fleet-capacity summary
(`164 cores · 421G free / 518G RAM`). It answers "which machine has room right now?" —
the utilization signal the teammate scheduler doesn't yet see. It's **cache-first**:
reads serve instantly from a stats cache the daemon warms (~every 3 min), probing only
this machine locally plus any device missing from the cache; pass `--refresh` (or the
shorter `--live`) to force a full live probe of every box. Cache-served output notes its
age (`updated 2m ago — pass --refresh (--live) for a live probe`).

`agents fleet status` answers "is my fleet OK?" at a glance: a one-line rollup
(`● N online · ○ M offline`), a short **NEEDS ATTENTION** list where every item names
the command that fixes it (offline → `check the box`, config drift or a stark CLI gap →
`agents fleet apply --device <box>`, version skew → `agents upgrade --fleet`), then quiet per-device
rows grouped by OS (macOS / Linux / Windows) showing just `name · capacity · load/mem ·
version`, with this machine flagged `▸ … ← this machine`. A healthy fleet reads in a few
lines; orphaned versions are demoted to a one-line `agents prune` nudge in the footer.

Pass `--verbose` for the full per-device grid — the **Auth column** (which agent accounts
are actually logged in, per device, read from the auth-health cache — no network), plus
the CLI-readiness and sync-drift columns. The Auth column has four buckets so it never
cries wolf: `●live` (verified), `·present` (signed in but the agent has no live-probe
endpoint — e.g. codex/grok — benign), `◐degraded` (soft/self-healing: expired-but-refreshing,
rate-limited), and `○revoked` (server rejected — re-login now). Only `○` means a real
re-login is needed. Run `agents fleet ping` to force a live re-verification across the fleet.

`agents devices harnesses` answers "what can each box actually run right now?" — one row
per installed `agent@version` across the fleet with its **account**, **signed-in**,
**quota** (highest usage-window utilization; `*` = from the cached snapshot), and a single
**ready** verdict (signed in AND not rate-limited). It SSH-probes each online device
(bounded, so one unreachable box can't stall the glance) and reuses the daemon-warmed usage
cache, so it never blocks on a per-account network fetch — pass `--refresh` (`--live`) for a
live quota read. `agents devices accounts` is the same data through the **identity lens**:
one row per account, collapsing the installs that share it (e.g. five claude versions on one
email) and naming which harnesses use it — the fast way to see which accounts are logged in
and healthy across every machine. Scope either with `--agents <csv>` / `--device <csv>`, and
add `--json` for the machine-readable per-host rows.

**Hosts** (`agents hosts`) are git-synced dispatch targets in `agents.yaml`; **devices** (`agents devices`) are your Tailscale machines in a local registry. Both ride SSH and feed one host pool: devices appear in `agents hosts list` and capability routing without a second enrollment. On `--device` runs every `agents run` option is either forwarded (`--effort --env --timeout --loop …`), rejected loud (`--secrets` never crosses SSH implicitly), or consumed locally — nothing silently drops. See [docs/concepts.md](cli/docs/concepts.md#devices--hosts).

Every `--device` command rides the shared SSH transport so host resolution,
identity checks, environment forwarding, reconnect behavior, and multiplexing cannot
drift between callers. See [fleet architecture](cli/docs/fleet.md).

## Teams

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/teams.svg" alt="agents teams: parallel agents in dependency order, each detached in its own worktree with boundary contracts." width="100%" />
</p>


```bash
agents teams create auth-feature

# Research first, then implement, then test.
agents teams add auth-feature claude "Research auth libraries"       --name researcher
agents teams add auth-feature codex  "Draft the migration"           --name migrator --after researcher
agents teams add auth-feature claude "Write tests for the new code"  --name tester   --after migrator

agents teams start auth-feature     # Fires teammates whose deps are done
agents teams status auth-feature    # Who's working, what they changed, what they said
```

Teammates run detached -- close your terminal, they keep working. Check in with `teams status`, glance at a teammate's summary with `teams logs <name>` (add `--full` for the raw output), clean up with `teams disband`.

Team state is observable via `agents teams list --json` / `agents teams status --json` (compact by default; add `--verbose` for the full per-teammate shape). External tools join it with `sessions --json` (teammates get `isTeamOrigin: true`) and `cloud list --json` (for `--cloud` teammates) to build a unified fleet view. See [docs/observability.md](cli/docs/observability.md).

Placement, spawn, dependency, and non-zero-exit failures are persisted as sanitized
evidence on the teammate record and shown by `teams status`. A failed root does not stop
independent DAG branches; descendants name the failed or missing `--after` dependency
that blocked them instead of remaining pending indefinitely. Capacity- or load-blocked
placement stays pending with retryable evidence and is reconsidered on the next wave.
`teams start` reports
teammates that failed during the wave (`Failed this wave` / JSON `failed[]`) and exits
non-zero when a wave produced only failures. A failed teammate keeps its record as
evidence, so re-adding the same name needs `teams remove <team> <name>` first.

---

## Cloud

Some work shouldn't tie up your laptop. `agents cloud run` hands a task to a managed provider that clones the repo, plans, implements, tests, and opens a PR -- while your terminal stays free. The `host` provider dispatches the same way onto machines you own: `agents cloud run "…" --device gpu-box` (tasks track in `agents cloud ps` and `agents hosts ps` alike).

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/cloud.svg" alt="agents cloud run dispatches one prompt to a managed provider (Rush, Codex, Cursor, Factory, or Antigravity) that runs while you keep working" width="100%" />
</p>

```bash
# Dispatch and detach — streams to the cloud, not your terminal.
agents cloud run "fix the flaky test in the payments suite" \
  --provider rush --repo acme/api --branch main

agents cloud list                                      # what's running, queued, or needs review
agents cloud logs <id>                                 # re-attach and stream
agents cloud message <id> "also update the changelog"  # steer it mid-run
agents cloud cancel <id>
```

Five managed backends behind one interface (`agents cloud providers`):

| Provider | What runs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `rush` | Claude against a GitHub repo + branch | Opens a PR. Multi-repo via repeatable `--repo`; attach screenshots with `--image` for vision dispatch. |
| `codex` | A pre-built Codex Cloud environment | Target it with `--env`. |
| `factory` | `droid exec` on a cloud VM | Computer-use; pick the box with `--computer`. |
| `antigravity` | Gemini managed agents | Antigravity harness in a remote sandbox. |
| `cursor` | Cursor Cloud Agents | v1 REST API with repo, status, SSE, cancel, and follow-up runs. |

Auto-routes each `--agent` to its native cloud, or pin the backend with `--provider`. Instead of dispatching now, register a run as an **event trigger** with `--on pull_request` (also `push`, `issue_comment`, `workflow_run`) -- it persists as a trigger-bound routine that fires on the event. `--json` on every subcommand for scripting.

The same dispatch is a placement on `agents run`: `agents run claude "fix the flaky e2e" --cloud --repo acme/api` routes through the identical provider registry and tracks in `agents cloud list/status/logs` alike. `--cloud` sits alongside `--device`/`--lease` as one of three placements (local, machine, cloud) and is mutually exclusive with them; `--where cloud[:provider]` is the one-door spelling. Agents without a native cloud fail loud unless `--provider` is given.

## Workflows

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/workflows.svg" alt="agents workflows: bundle an orchestrator prompt with optional subagents, skills, and plugins into a named, reusable pipeline invoked as one agent." width="100%" />
</p>


Bundle an orchestrator prompt with optional subagents, skills, and plugins into a named, reusable pipeline. One bundle, one invocation.

```bash
# Use a workflow — workflow name goes in the agent slot
agents run code-review "review PR #42 on acme/api"

# List + inspect
agents workflows list
agents workflows view code-review

# Install from GitHub or local
agents workflows add gh:yourteam/code-review
agents workflows add ./my-workflow
```

A workflow is a directory:

```
~/.agents/workflows/code-review/
  WORKFLOW.md          # YAML frontmatter + orchestrator system prompt
  subagents/           # optional: *.md files exposed to the orchestrator
    security.md
    style.md
  skills/              # optional: knowledge packs scoped to this workflow
  plugins/             # optional: plugin bundles
```

`WORKFLOW.md`'s Markdown body is the orchestrator's system prompt. Files under `subagents/` get copied to `~/.claude/agents/` at run time so the built-in Agent tool can dispatch to them by name — including in parallel. `skills/` and `plugins/` sync into the version home just for the run.

```yaml
# WORKFLOW.md frontmatter
---
name: Code Review
description: Evidence-grounded PR review with file:line citations.
model: opus
tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Bash
  - WebFetch
---
```

Workflows that need to write — post PR comments, edit files, send Slack — should run with `--mode edit`, or `--mode auto` on Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Codex. Reserve `--mode skip` (legacy alias: `full`) for last-resort bypasses. `agents run` defaults to `--mode plan` for other harnesses; Codex defaults to its safe writable profile. An explicit Codex `--mode plan` is read-only with network access.

Resolution is project > user > system: a `<repo>/.agents/workflows/<name>/` overrides a same-named workflow in `~/.agents/workflows/`. Commit project workflows with your repo so teammates get the same pipeline.

---

## Plugins

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/plugins.svg" alt="agents plugins: bundle skills, commands, hooks, and MCP servers under one manifest, mirrored into every installed agent version automatically." width="100%" />
</p>


Bundle skills, commands, hooks, MCP servers, settings, and permissions under a single manifest. One source dir at `~/.agents/plugins/<name>/`, mirrored into every installed Claude / OpenClaw version automatically.

```bash
# Add (install) from a git URL or local path — `install` is an alias for `add`
agents plugins add hivemind@https://github.com/activeloopai/hivemind.git
agents plugins add ./my-plugin

# Apply to one agent (default version) or all supported
agents sync --plugin rush-toolkit claude
agents sync --plugin rush-toolkit
```

A plugin is a directory with a manifest:

```
~/.agents/plugins/my-plugin/
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json       # required: { name, version, description }
  skills/<name>/SKILL.md           # optional
  commands/*.md                    # optional
  hooks/hooks.json                 # optional — executable surface
  .mcp.json                        # optional — executable surface
  bin/, scripts/, settings.json    # optional — executable surface
  permissions/                     # optional — executable surface
```

On sync, agi-cli copies the plugin into each version home's marketplace (`<home>/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/agents-cli/plugins/<name>/`), registers the synthetic marketplace, and flips `settings.json#enabledPlugins[<name>@agents-cli] = true` so Claude / OpenClaw load it.

### Executable-surface gate

Plugins that ship `hooks/`, `.mcp.json`, `bin/`, `scripts/`, `settings.json` (non-permissions), or `permissions/` can execute code on session events. agi-cli requires explicit consent before flipping `enabledPlugins`:

```bash
# Hooks-bearing plugins copy in but stay disabled by default
agents plugins add hivemind@https://github.com/activeloopai/hivemind.git \
  --allow-exec-surfaces

# Same gate on re-sync (e.g., after upstream updates)
agents sync --plugin hivemind claude --allow-exec-surfaces
```

Skills, commands, and subagents are declarative and never trip the gate. The gate is per-plugin, per-install: consenting to hivemind doesn't grant blanket exec-surface trust to anything else.

### Version portability

Plugins live in the user repo (`~/.agents/plugins/`), not inside any single version home. Switching Claude via `agents use claude@<v>` re-syncs the plugin into the new version automatically — no re-install. New Claude versions added later pick it up on their first sync. Project-level `<repo>/.agents/plugins/<name>/` overrides a same-named user plugin (resolution is project > user > system, same as every other resource).

### Install the agents-cli skill in any agent

This repo is itself a Claude plugin marketplace and a [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) source. The `agents-cli` skill teaches any coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, …) how to drive the `agents` CLI — so when you ask *"how do I run multiple coding agents in parallel?"* the agent surfaces `agents teams` instead of guessing.

```bash
# Claude Code — add this repo as a marketplace, then install the plugin
claude plugin marketplace add phnx-labs/agi-cli
claude plugin install agents-cli@agents-cli

# skills.sh — install the skill directly from the repo
npx skills add phnx-labs/agi-cli
```

The manifest is `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (validate with `claude plugin validate .`); the skill source is [`skills/agents-cli/SKILL.md`](skills/agents-cli/SKILL.md). Its `description` carries the exact intents the runtime matches against — *run multiple coding agents in parallel*, *manage multiple Claude Code accounts*, *I hit my usage limit*, *resume a session on another machine*, *pin the agent CLI version* — each with a verified command recipe.

---

## Make it yours

White-label the CLI. `agents setup mine` mints a **personally-named binary** — `jack` instead of `agents` — that _is_ agi-cli: same tool, your name, running the exact feature set you choose. Anyone can mint their own; Jack and Pranjal each get an independent brand.

```bash
agents setup mine                      # wizard: pick a name, check off what to disable
agents setup mine init jack --disable teams cloud   # or non-interactively

jack run claude "hello"                # every agents verb, under your name
jack --help                            # help, version, and errors all read "jack"
```

Manage brands with `agents setup mine list | toggle | remove`:

```bash
agents setup mine toggle jack --disable-plugin rush --disable-skill deploy
agents setup mine toggle jack --enable teams
agents setup mine remove jack --purge
```

Under the hood, `init` creates a pass-through shim that selects a brand configuration;
it does not fork the execution engine. Curated resources still resolve through the
ordinary [resource architecture](cli/docs/resources.md).

> Branded builds are free for personal and commercial use alike. New versions ship under FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0: every user and company may use, modify, and redistribute; only offering agents-cli itself as a competing commercial product or service is barred, and each version automatically becomes Apache-2.0 two years after release.

## Browser

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/browser.svg" alt="agents browser drives your real, already-installed Chrome over CDP — the CLI issues start / refs / click / type / screenshot; the browser exposes numbered element refs and returns a token-efficient screenshot. Same fingerprint, same IP, so sites can't detect automation — it works where Playwright gets blocked." width="100%" />
</p>

Give agents access to a real browser — no relay extension, no cloud service, no Playwright getting blocked.

Each device declares its own browsers in its own `devices/<machine>/agents.yaml`.
The fleet registry is the union of those files: a name declared by one device is
identity-bearing (the daemon tunnels to that device); a name declared by several
is fungible (use the local one). `--device` is only valid on `agents browser start`;
later verbs resolve the device from the task.

```bash
# First run: omit --profile and we auto-pick the first installed Chromium-family
# browser. macOS prefers Chrome > Brave > Edge > Chromium > Comet; Linux prefers
# Chrome > Chromium > Brave > Edge; Windows prefers Edge (always preinstalled) >
# Chrome > Brave > Comet. The auto-picked profile is saved as "auto-chrome".
export AGENTS_BROWSER_TASK=$(agents browser start --url https://app.example.com)

# Or pin a named profile to a specific browser (chrome, comet, brave, chromium,
# edge, or custom) when you want isolation from auto-detect.
agents browser profiles create work --browser chrome
# `start` writes the resolved name (e.g. `swift-crab-falcon-a3f92b1c`) to stdout
# and human-friendly commentary to stderr, so $(...) capture stays clean.
export AGENTS_BROWSER_TASK=$(agents browser start --profile work --url https://app.example.com)
agents browser refs                  # Get interactive element refs
agents browser click 42              # Click element ref 42
agents browser type 15 --text "hello"  # Type into element ref 15
agents browser screenshot            # Smart resizing, token-efficient
agents browser record start --fps 10 --duration 40
# Drive the page, then finalize a playable WebM under the task's recordings/ dir.
agents browser record stop
agents browser tabs                  # List tabs open for the current task
agents browser tab focus tab123      # Switch focus to another tab
agents browser done                  # Close task's tabs when finished

# Need to address a different task in the same shell? Override per call:
agents browser screenshot --task other-flow

# Repeated observe/action loops: one Node process and daemon socket stay warm.
printf '%s\n' \
  '{"action":"screenshot","path":"/tmp/page.jpg"}' \
  '{"action":"click","atX":320,"atY":540}' \
  | agents browser stream --task "$AGENTS_BROWSER_TASK"
```

Recording resolves ffmpeg automatically. It reuses a usable binary on `PATH` or
under `~/.agents/.cache`, and when none exists it installs through Homebrew on
macOS, apt on Debian/Ubuntu, or the available platform package manager. If the
automatic path cannot run, the error names the exact manual install command.

### Why this works where Playwright fails

Playwright and Puppeteer spin up fresh browser instances with automation flags. Sites like LinkedIn, Google, and most finance apps detect and block them immediately.

`agents browser` launches your existing residential Chrome (or Brave, Edge, Chromium) on your machine via CDP. Same browser fingerprint, same IP, same everything. Sites can't detect automation because you're using the same browser you'd use manually.

### Token-efficient automation

The CLI handles the mechanical work so agents don't burn tokens on low-level browser commands. Screenshots are automatically resized without excessive compression — agents process smaller images while keeping the detail they need to make decisions.

### Profile isolation

Multiple agents can run browser tasks simultaneously without stepping on each other. Each profile gets its own user data directory, cookies, and state. One agent logs into your work Slack, another into your personal email — no conflicts, no shared state.

```bash
agents browser profiles create work-slack --browser chrome
agents browser profiles create personal-gmail --browser chrome
# Two agents, two profiles, no interference
```

### Safe credential access

Attach a [secrets bundle](#secrets) to a profile. The agent can log in without credentials in plaintext, and every secret access is recorded in the session log.

```bash
agents browser profiles create bank --browser chrome --secrets bank-creds
```

### Electron apps

Control Electron apps (Slack, Discord, VS Code, your own app) with custom binaries:

```bash
agents browser profiles create slack \
  --browser custom \
  --binary "/Applications/Slack.app/Contents/MacOS/Slack" \
  --electron
```

### Remote browsers

Identity-bearing names tunnel automatically: declare `comet-local` only on the
machine that holds the logins, and every other box reaches it through the
daemon. `--device` on `start` binds a task to a specific box (fungible names,
or an explicit pick). Later verbs reject `--device`.

```bash
# Local CDP (discovers WebSocket URL automatically)
agents browser profiles create local-debug \
  --browser chrome \
  --endpoint "http://localhost:9222"

# Bind a task to a fleet device at start; later verbs resolve it from the task
agents browser start --task post --device zion --url https://x.com/
agents browser screenshot --task post

# Explicit SSH endpoint, declared on the machine that owns the browser
agents browser profiles create staging \
  --browser chrome \
  --endpoint "ssh://deploy@staging.example.com?port=9222"

# Cloud browser services (BrowserBase, Steel, etc.)
agents browser profiles create cloud \
  --browser chrome \
  --endpoint "wss://connect.browserbase.com?apiKey=..."
```

---

## Sign in

Signing in is **optional**. Every local feature — `agents run`, sessions, teams, fleet dispatch, secrets, browser, computer — works with no account. Signing in unlocks the hosted surfaces: **team spaces** (`agents auth space`) and **managed trace sync** — `agents traces sync` publishes to our storage with **zero Cloudflare setup**. `agents auth` signs this machine in to **Phoenix ID**, the Phoenix Labs account layer behind these hosted surfaces. Sign-in is Google-only and runs a device-code flow: the CLI shows a code, your browser confirms it, and the CLI picks the session up.

```bash
agents auth login                        # shows a code, opens a Phoenix-branded page
agents auth whoami                       # who this machine is signed in as (--json)
agents auth logout                       # clears THIS machine; no other device is touched

agents auth space create "Design Team"   # spaces are the team primitive
agents auth space list                   # spaces you belong to
agents auth space invite ada@example.com --role member
agents auth space members                # who is in it
agents auth space role ada@example.com admin
agents auth space remove ada@example.com # or remove yourself to leave
```

The session lives in this machine's agents state dir, so `logout` here signs out nothing else. `whoami` and every `space` subcommand take `--json`. `PHOENIX_ID_BASE` points the CLI at a different account service (a local one, for instance); it defaults to the deployed Phoenix ID service.

Distinct from **Accounts** below: this is *your human identity*; those are the *harness credentials* an agent runs under.

---

## Accounts

Choose an agent and an account, independently of its release number. Install the
harness once; each account is a credential slot of that one install -- login,
settings, and sessions stay in place when the executable is updated. Add an
account on a headed (personal/desktop) device; workers pick up the durable
credential automatically.

```bash
agents add claude
agents accounts add claude work          # headed: native login + worker credential + sync
agents accounts add codex personal
agents accounts login claude#work        # re-auth into the same slot
agents accounts default claude work
agents run claude#work
agents accounts list
agents view claude                       # accounts and usage, one row per identity
agents view claude --versions            # legacy diagnostic: every retained installation and actual release
```

`accounts add <harness> [name]` reuses the managed install, creates a HOME-shaped
slot (no binary), drives the native login there, registers the fleet-wide row, and
mints the worker credential (claude: `setup-token`; codex/grok/cursor/opencode:
`--api-key` or a prompt). On a worker it refuses before any slot, install, or
browser. An already-registered name or identity points at `accounts login`.
`accounts login <harness>#<name>` re-auths into the same slot, fails closed on a
different identity, and re-mints. Native login stays device-local; an account
known on another device is not necessarily logged in here.

Agents checks for updates to safely managed harness installations automatically.
Disable this globally or per harness with `agents config set updates.auto false`
or `agents config set updates.codex.auto false`. Use `agents update codex --check`
to inspect eligibility without installing, or `agents update codex` to update
that harness's installations. Running sessions and deliberately pinned
installations are protected. See [installation and update policy](cli/docs/version-management.md).

For a portable **provider credential** (API key / setup-token / bearer), the first
arg is the account name, not a harness id:

```bash
agents accounts add work --provider anthropic --auth setup-token
agents accounts add gateway --provider openrouter --auth api-key \
  --from-secrets openrouter.ai:OPENROUTER_API_KEY  # import from an existing secrets bundle
agents accounts add deepinfra --provider deepinfra --auth api-key

agents accounts default claude work              # claude uses `work` when --account is omitted
agents accounts sync work --device yosemite-s0   # copy the bundle to a worker
agents run claude --account work
agents harness add deepinfra --account deepinfra
```

Mixing `accounts add <harness>` with `--provider` fails loud as ambiguous. One
provider account **is** one `agents secrets` bundle -- `accounts add` creates it
with secrets policy `never`, so a background launch never raises Touch ID.
Harness-native OAuth stays where the harness put it and is never copied.

```bash
agents accounts list
agents accounts rename claude#work cloud
agents accounts logout claude#work
agents accounts remove claude#cloud
```

`accounts list` shows native logins and provider credentials together. `rename` /
`remove` / `view` take `<harness>#<name>` when the same name exists on several
harnesses; an ambiguous bare name is refused. `logout` signs out a native OAuth
login; API-key accounts use `remove`. `accounts sync <name> --device <device>`
is the only way a provider credential crosses machines.

Selection order for a run is explicit `--account` / `<harness>#<name>`, then
`accounts default` for that harness, then the harness's native/balanced behavior.
The `connect` / `name` / `label` / `mint` / `attach` / `detach` / `switch` /
`set-default` verbs are deleted; use `add` / `login` / `default` /
`run <harness>#<name>` instead.

---

## Secrets

Secrets are the standalone **`secrets` CLI** (`@phnx-labs/secrets-cli`). agi-cli does not ship the engine. `agents secrets` is a passthrough to the same binary.

```bash
# Install (pick one — no extra env vars)
agents clis install secrets
# or
npm i -g @phnx-labs/secrets-cli@0.1.2
# or, after agents is installed:
agents setup secrets
```

```bash
# API keys in Keychain, not in .env files.
secrets create prod-stripe
secrets add prod-stripe STRIPE_SECRET_KEY     # Prompts, stores in Keychain
agents run claude "charge a test card" --secrets prod-stripe
```

> **Platform:** macOS Keychain, Linux libsecret / file store. On Windows (non-WSL), use environment variables or a `.env` file instead.

The macOS broker is **not** the agents daemon. It is `secrets _agent-run` (started by `secrets start` or on first unlock), socket under `$SECRETS_HOME/.cache/helpers/secrets-agent/` (`~/.agents` when you go through `agents secrets`). Linux has no broker. `agents daemon` never hosts it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/secrets.svg" alt="How agi-cli secrets work: bundle definitions live in the macOS Keychain alongside their values, agi-cli resolves at runtime and injects the env into the child process" width="100%" />
</p>

Merge order: profile env < `--secrets` < `--env K=V`. A missing keychain item aborts before the child starts.

### Cross-machine sync

Secrets are provided by the standalone [`@phnx-labs/secrets-cli`](https://github.com/phnx-labs/secrets-cli)
engine (`agents setup secrets` installs it if missing). Its `push`/`pull`
verbs move a bundle between machines by encrypting it and round-tripping it
through `api.prix.dev` — no copy-paste, no `.env` files emailed to yourself:

```bash
# On laptop:
agents secrets create npm-tokens
agents secrets add npm-tokens NPM_TOKEN          # value lives in the local keychain/file store
agents secrets push npm-tokens                   # encrypt + upload

# On another machine:
agents secrets pull npm-tokens                   # decrypt + restore locally
agents run claude "..." --secrets npm-tokens     # injects NPM_TOKEN automatically
```

Nothing about a secret's value ever lives in plaintext on disk, on either end.

### Per-secret metadata and rotation

Tag each secret with `--type`, `--expires`, and `--note` so the bundle is self-documenting. `--expires` is always future-dated (`YYYY-MM-DD`); past or same-day values are rejected. Use `agents secrets rotate <bundle> <key>` to refresh a credential — `add` only creates new keys, `rotate` replaces the value and preserves metadata unless overridden.

```bash
agents secrets add prod STRIPE_API_KEY --type api-key --expires 2027-01-15 --note "Live key, owner: payments-team"
agents secrets rotate prod STRIPE_API_KEY --note "rotated after suspected leak"
agents secrets list   # EXPIRING column flags secrets due in the next 30 days
```

---

## Routines

```bash
# Claude Code reviews PRs every weekday at 9 AM. Scheduler auto-starts.
agents routines add daily-digest \
  --schedule "0 9 * * 1-5" \
  --agent claude \
  --project-anchor agents-cli \
  --cwd cli \
  --prompt "Review yesterday's PRs and summarize key changes"

agents routines list                   # All jobs + next run times
agents routines status                 # Scheduler health + next fires (add --json for owner device, last fire, last error, in-flight run per routine)
agents routines run daily-digest       # Test it now, ignore the schedule
agents routines logs daily-digest      # Last execution — status + report (add --full for raw stdout)
agents routines runs daily-digest      # Every attempt, including blocked/skipped pre-session runs
agents routines doctor daily-digest    # Project/CWD/trust/write/auth readiness
agents routines stats                  # Run count, failed, missed, avg/p50/p95 duration — per job or all

# Definitions sync to every device; activation is stored per hostname
agents routines add nightly-drain --schedule "0 3 * * *" --agent claude \
  --cwd '~' \
  --prompt "Drain the local work queue"

agents routines devices nightly-drain --set yosemite-s0           # one schedule owner
agents routines list --device yosemite-s0                            # query another device

# Signed webhook trigger: Linear issue labeled "agent" fires a routine
agents routines add agent-labeled-issue --on linear:Issue --action update \
  --team-key RUSH --label agent --agent claude \
  --cwd '~' \
  --prompt "Work the Linear issue that was just labeled agent"
agents daemon webhooks add --secrets-bundle webhooks --port 8787    # supervised receiver: /hooks/linear, /hooks/github
agents daemon funnel up yosemite-s0 --local-port 8787 --port 443    # public HTTPS ingress
```

Jobs run sandboxed -- agents only see directories and tools you explicitly allow.
`--project` tags a routine into a project **group** for listings only -- it never
decides where the body runs. The reliability contract (execution anchor + `--cwd`,
readiness that saves a blocked routine paused, and the `blocked`/`skipped` run
statuses) is specified in
[docs/specifications.md §Routine execution & readiness](cli/docs/specifications.md#routine-execution--readiness);
some of it is planned (RUSH-2290), and the section marks what is landed vs intended.

### Daemon

Routines, browser IPC, and the watchdog pass all run inside one always-on
daemon per device. `agents daemon` is its runtime surface:

```bash
agents daemon                # identity + duplicates + per-service health (same as status)
agents daemon status --json  # machine-readable, for scripts / AGI EXT

agents daemon start          # start it (bypasses daemon.enabled -- the deliberate override)
agents daemon stop           # stop it
agents daemon restart        # stop then start

agents daemon disable        # persist daemon.enabled: false -- nothing auto-starts it
agents daemon enable         # clear the kill switch

agents daemon reload                        # SIGHUP -- reload jobs, re-evaluate scheduler.enabled, no restart
agents daemon services                      # health of every hosted service (browser IPC, scheduler, ...)
agents daemon services list                 # every toggleable service and its current on/off state
agents daemon services enable scheduler
agents daemon services disable browser-ipc  # stop hosting browser IPC without stopping the daemon
agents browser stop --service               # browser-scoped alias; next browser action requiring IPC re-enables it
agents routines stop                        # disable/reload only the scheduler service
agents daemon logs -f --level warn --since 1h
agents daemon doctor                        # one-shot health check; non-zero exit on problems
```

Each hosted responsibility (browser IPC, scheduler, monitors, watchdog, device
probe, self-heal, self-update, account-state refresh, state-dir checks) is an
independent toggle in `~/.agents/daemon/services.yaml`.
Self-update checks npm on its own schedule, installs + verifies a newer
agents-cli with the same primitives `agents upgrade` uses, then exits so the OS
supervisor relaunches the daemon onto the new code — the daemon used to run
with auto-update forced off and only picked up new code on a manual
`agents daemon restart`.
`agents daemon services list` shows every service; `enable|disable <id>` flips
one. Missing keys default to enabled, so upgrades are no-ops. Most services take
effect on the next daemon start; browser IPC is registered even when boot-disabled
so browser commands can enable it live, while scheduler and monitor engine also
re-evaluate on `SIGHUP reload`. Only `agents daemon start|stop|restart` owns the
whole process lifecycle. Browser and routines clients change their own service
state without evicting sibling work.

There is no `agents daemon jobs` -- scheduled work is always `agents routines`
(see `agents routines stats` for per-routine failure detail). `disable` is a
device-local kill switch: with it set, `routines add`/`routines start`/
`routines catchup`/`monitors add`/webhook triggers stop auto-starting the daemon, mirroring
`systemctl disable` -- `agents daemon start` still works as the explicit
override.

## Monitors

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/monitors.svg" alt="agents monitors: a watched source (poll a command, an HTTP endpoint, a file, or a fleet device) flows into a condition (changed? matched? deduped by a native state store) that fires an action — run an agent with the event in its prompt, kick a routine, or notify. Pin the owner device for exactly-once." width="100%" />
</p>

```bash
# Routines fire on a clock. Monitors fire on a change: watch a source, and when
# it flips, spawn an agent, kick a routine, or notify. The cross-agent layer --
# agents watching sources (including the fleet and other agents) and reacting.

# CI goes red -> a Claude agent triages it (poll a command, diff, match a pattern)
agents monitors add ci-red \
  --poll 'gh pr checks 1249 --json name,bucket' 30s --match fail \
  --run claude --prompt 'CI failed: {event}. Diagnose and fix.' \
  --device yosemite-s0

# Merge-on-green: ok only if the PR actually merged, not just because the agent exited 0
agents monitors add merge-1682 \
  --poll 'gh pr view 1682 --json state --jq .state' 2m --match OPEN \
  --run claude --prompt 'Rebase-merge #1682: {event}' \
  --postcondition 'gh pr view 1682 --json state --jq .state | grep -qx MERGED'

# A fleet box goes unreachable or overloaded -> notify (watch the fleet itself)
agents monitors add box-down --watch-device mac-mini --on-change --notify telegram

# Poll an endpoint every 8h; fire once when the body flips to "issued"
agents monitors add cert-issued \
  --poll-http 'https://secure.ssl.com/.../order' 8h --match issued --notify telegram

agents monitors test ci-red    # Dry-run: evaluate the source once, show what it would fire -- no action
agents monitors list           # Every monitor: source, owner device, last fired
```

Sources: a command's stdout (`--watch` / `--poll`), an HTTP endpoint (`--poll-http`), a file (`--watch-file`), or a fleet device's reachability + load (`--watch-device`). Push sources -- a signed webhook (`--on`) and a WebSocket (`--ws`) -- are accepted today and delivered through a receiver wired in a follow-up. Conditions: fire on any change (`--on-change`), on a regex (`--match`), or `--every` tick -- deduped by a native state store, so a monitor stays silent until something *actually* changes. Actions: `--run <agent>` (the event is injected into the prompt as `{event}`), `--routine`, `--notify`, or `--webhook-out`. A `--run`/`--routine` action can take `--postcondition '<cmd>'` — a shell command that must exit 0 after the agent settles, otherwise `agents monitors runs` records `no effect` rather than `ok`. Pin a monitor to one owner device with `--device` (exactly-once), or offload the action elsewhere with `--run-on`. Runs in the routines daemon; `agents monitors pause` / `resume` any time.

---

## Share

Publishing an agent's HTML output to a shareable link now lives in the standalone
`artifacts` CLI (`@phnx-labs/artifacts-cli`), not in `agents`. The `agents artifacts`
command group was removed (PHNX-3992), the same split as secrets (PHNX-3989) and
computer (PHNX-4075). Sign in and publish with it directly:

```bash
artifacts auth login       # Phoenix ID device-code sign-in
artifacts share plan.html  # publish the HTML and print the link
```

`agents sessions share <id>` stays in this CLI: it renders a session transcript to
HTML locally, then shells out to `artifacts share` to publish it, so a conversation
becomes a shareable link the same way any other artifact does.

---

## PTY

Real pseudoterminals for REPLs, TUIs, and interactive programs moved to the
standalone [`term` CLI](https://github.com/phnx-labs/term-cli)
(`npm i -g @phnx-labs/term-cli`), published separately (PHNX-4091). Same
verbs, flags, and JSON shapes `agents pty` used to have:

```bash
SID=$(term start)
term exec $SID "python3"
term screen $SID                # Clean text, no ANSI -- what a human sees
term write $SID "print('hello')\n"
term stop $SID
```

`term`'s own sidecar server holds sessions alive between CLI calls and renders `screen` via a headless terminal emulator; sessions auto-clean after 30 minutes idle. See [term-cli's README](https://github.com/phnx-labs/term-cli#readme) for the full command reference.

---

## Portable setup

```bash
# New machine? One command.
agents setup

# Installs CLIs, registers MCP servers, syncs skills/commands/rules/hooks,
# sets up shims, configures defaults. Done.

agents repo push     # Snapshot your config to git
```

### How config is layered

Two repos with the same shape, different roles:

| Repo | Role | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.agents-system/` | **System repo** — core/built-in skills, commands, hooks, rules, MCP configs, permissions, and profiles that ship with `agi-cli`. The defaults every install gets. | Maintained upstream at [phnx-labs/.agents](https://github.com/phnx-labs/.agents) (formerly `.agents-system`) |
| `~/.agents/` | **User repo** — your personal additions and overrides. This is what `agents repo push`/`pull` syncs. | You |

**Version pinning:** `agents.yaml` at project root pins which agent version to use (like `.nvmrc` for Node).

**Resource resolution:** When syncing resources (commands, skills, rules, hooks, MCP, permissions), the order is **project > user > system**. A `.agents/` directory at project root wins, then `~/.agents/`, then `~/.agents-system/`. Same-named resources higher in the chain override lower ones; everything else unions in. Run `agents view --merged` to see the effective skills, commands, MCP servers, hooks, rules, plugins, workflows, and subagents, with each row tagged by its winning layer.

See [docs/concepts.md](cli/docs/concepts.md) for the full mental model: DotAgents repos, resource kinds, and how resolution works end-to-end.

Other useful commands: `agents doctor` checks CLI availability and resource sync drift, `agents view` shows per-account quota/rate-limit data for installed agents, `agents config budget` shows cross-vendor spend caps and current spend-to-cap (and enforces pre-flight estimates + a hard-cap kill-switch on every run — see [docs/observability.md](cli/docs/observability.md#budget-guardrails-agents-budget)), `agents import` adopts an existing unmanaged install, `agents trash` lists and restores soft-deleted version directories, and `agents subagents` installs reusable subagent definitions for parent-agent workflows.

---

## Menu bar

On macOS, `agi-cli` puts a status item in your menu bar -- a live glance at what your agents are doing, plus a Spotlight-style bar for filing work without breaking focus.

```bash
agents menubar setup       # configure end-to-end: one instance, started at login
agents menubar status      # is it installed and running?
```

There is only ever **one** agents mark: the helper takes a lock at launch, so a
second copy surfaces the running one's menu and exits instead of adding a
duplicate icon. `agents menubar setup` is the recovery command when a machine is
already wrong -- it ends any duplicate, installs the bundle, wires the login
item, and verifies exactly one helper came back up.

The helper itself is AGI Menu, developed in
[phnx-labs/agi-menu](https://github.com/phnx-labs/agi-menu) and published as a
signed, notarized build on this repo's `menubar/v<x.y.z>` releases; the CLI
downloads and verifies it on demand, so nothing is built on your machine.

The dropdown surfaces a **NEEDS YOU** queue (agents waiting on a question, a plan review, or a permission prompt), the running roster, and a routines summary -- the same live state as `agents sessions --active`, one click away.

### Quick-issue bar (⌘⇧O)

Press `Cmd-Shift-O` anywhere for a thin capture surface: the prepared text field appears immediately while repo, thumbnail, and ticket rows hydrate in the background. Type a one-line note, `Cmd-V` to paste, and attach one or more recent screenshots (double-click a thumbnail to preview it in full). Submit, and a headless agent picks the right project from your recent sessions, investigates, and files the Linear ticket itself -- you never leave what you were doing.

The bar also lists the **open Linear tickets of the repo you picked**, urgent first. Switching the repo switches the Linear project; typing filters the list, so an existing ticket shows up before you file a duplicate; and clicking a row (or `⌘1`-`⌘5`) dispatches that ticket to the selected agents -- **Run** implements it, **Plan** posts a plan as a ticket comment.

</p>

## Private skills

Keep work or personal skills in a separate repo — public ones in `~/.agents/`, private ones in an extra repo that merges in at sync time.

```bash
# Add a private repo for work-only skills
agents repo add gh:yourname/.agents-work

# Add with a custom alias
agents repo add git@github.com:acme/team-skills.git --as acme

agents repo list          # Primary + every registered extra
agents repo pull          # Pull updates for all enabled extras
agents repo disable acme  # Stop merging without deleting
agents repo remove acme   # Unregister and delete the clone
```

Extras clone into `~/.agents-system/.repos/<alias>/` and ship the same layout as the primary (`skills/`, `commands/`, `hooks/`, `rules/`). Their contents merge into agent version homes after the primary's — so `~/.agents/` always wins on name collisions. `agents skills list` shows which repo each skill came from.

---

## Security & Privacy

**The CLI binary has no built-in telemetry or phone-home path.** Routine commands run locally; explicit features such as cloud dispatch and secrets push/pull send only the data needed for the action you invoke. Here's exactly what `agi-cli` stores locally and why.

### Event log

Every agent run, version install, browser launch, and secrets access is logged to `~/.agents/.cache/logs/events-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`. This gives you a complete record of what agents did on your machine.

```bash
# What gets logged (example event):
{
  "ts": "2026-05-09T10:23:45Z",
  "event": "agent.run.end",
  "agent": "claude",
  "version": "2.1.121",
  "prompt": "Fix the auth bug in...",  # truncated to 200 chars
  "durationMs": 45230,
  "exitCode": 0,
  "hostname": "your-mac",
  "platform": "darwin"
}
```

**What's logged:** Operation type, agent, version, timing, prompt length + SHA-256 hash (raw text never stored), exit codes, errors, and secret bundle/key names with caller context. Argv entries that look like tokens or secret paths are redacted. **What's NOT logged:** Raw prompts, outputs, file contents, or secret values.

**Permissions:** Logs directory is `0700` (owner-only), files are `0600`. Only you can read them.

**Retention:** 7 days by default, then auto-pruned.

**Opt out:** Set `AGENTS_DISABLE_EVENT_LOG=1` in your shell to disable completely.

### Session search

Conversations with Claude, Codex, legacy Gemini, and other agents scatter across their native storage. Session search indexes them locally so you can find any conversation:

```bash
agents sessions "auth middleware"     # Full-text search across all agents
agents sessions --agent claude --since 7d
agents sessions --include tools --query 'program:git' --fleet --json
agents sessions --include tools --query 'program:git' --count --fleet --json
agents sessions backfill tools --fleet
```

The index lives at `~/.agents/.history/sessions/sessions.db` (SQLite + FTS5). A local query stays on the machine; an explicit `--fleet` tool query sends only redacted, bounded match evidence or aggregate counts over SSH. Historical tool parsing is explicit via `sessions backfill tools`; queries never parse transcripts. See [Sessions](#sessions-across-agents) for full usage.

### Secrets

Secrets are provided by the standalone `@phnx-labs/secrets-cli` engine, stored
in the OS keychain or an encrypted file store — never in plaintext files.
Bundle definitions live alongside their values.

```bash
agents secrets create my-keys
agents secrets add my-keys API_KEY    # Prompts for value, stores in the keychain/file backend
```

Move a bundle to another machine with `secrets push`/`secrets pull` (encrypted
round trip through `api.prix.dev`). See [Secrets](#secrets) for full usage.

### Summary

| Data | Location | Who can read | Opt out |
|------|----------|--------------|---------|
| Event log | `~/.agents/.cache/logs/` | You only (0600) | `AGENTS_DISABLE_EVENT_LOG=1` |
| Session index | `~/.agents/.history/sessions/` | You only | Delete the directory |
| Secrets | OS keychain / encrypted file store | You + apps you authorize | Don't use `agents secrets` |
| Config | `~/.agents/` | You only | N/A |

## Compatibility

Which DotAgents resources each agent CLI can load. Source of truth: [src/lib/agents.ts](cli/src/lib/agents.ts) (`capabilities`); gates use `supports(agent, cap, version)` from [src/lib/capabilities.ts](cli/src/lib/capabilities.ts). Full matrix also in [docs/concepts.md](cli/docs/concepts.md).

> **Gemini CLI is hard-deprecated.** Google retired it for free, Pro, and Ultra tiers on **June 18, 2026** (announced at Google I/O 2026); the `gemini` command no longer serves requests on those tiers. agi-cli keeps the legacy `gemini` id only so old sessions/config can still be read. `agents add gemini`, `agents import gemini`, and `agents sync gemini` fail and point to **Antigravity CLI** (`antigravity`), Google's official successor — see [the transition notice](https://developers.googleblog.com/an-important-update-transitioning-gemini-cli-to-antigravity-cli/).

| Agent | Versions | Hooks | MCP | Permissions | Skills | Commands | Plugins | Subagents | Rules | Workflows |
|-------|----------|-------|-----|-------------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Claude Code | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | `CLAUDE.md` | yes |
| Codex CLI | yes | >= 0.116.0 | yes | no | yes | < 0.117.0 · skills ($name, >= 0.117) | >= 0.128.0 | no | `AGENTS.md` | no |
| Antigravity | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | `AGENTS.md` | no |
| Grok Build | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | skills ($name) | yes | no | `AGENTS.md` | no |
| OpenClaw | yes | yes | yes | no | yes | gateway | yes | yes | `workspace/AGENTS.md` | no |
| Cursor | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | IDE + skills ($name) | yes | >= 2026.1.22 | `.cursorrules` | no |
| OpenCode | yes | no | yes | >= 1.1.1 | yes | yes | no | no | `AGENTS.md` | no |
| Copilot | yes | no | yes | no | yes | yes | no | no | `AGENTS.md` | no |

| Droid | yes | yes | yes | >= 0.57.5 | >= 0.26.0 | yes | yes | yes | `AGENTS.md` | no |

**Legend:** `yes` / `no` = synced or skipped at install time. `skills ($name)` = no file-based slash-command dir; behavior ships as a generated skill invoked with `$command`. `IDE + skills ($name)` = an IDE command file plus a generated skill for the CLI. `gateway` = OpenClaw resolves slash commands at runtime, not from synced files. Version suffixes are enforced at sync time — out-of-range versions are skipped with a clear message.

**Host CLIs** (`agents cli`) are separate: YAML manifests under `~/.agents/cli/` install binaries onto your PATH (`gh`, `higgsfield`, etc.). They are not copied into per-agent version homes.

### agi-cli features (not agent-native resources)

| Agent | Routines | Teams | Session index |
|-------|----------|-------|---------------|
| Claude Code | yes | yes | yes |
| Codex CLI | yes | yes | yes |
| Cursor | -- | yes | -- |
| OpenCode | -- | yes | -- |
| Grok Build | -- | yes | yes |
| Antigravity | -- | yes | -- |
| Copilot | -- | -- | yes |
| OpenClaw, Amp, Goose, Roo | -- | -- | -- |

### Version-gated sync

| Capability | Agent | Gate |
|------------|-------|------|
| Hooks | Codex | >= 0.116.0 |
| Skills | Droid | >= 0.26.0 |
| Permissions | Droid | >= 0.57.5 |
| File-based commands | Codex | < 0.117.0 (0.117+ uses command-as-skill) |
| Plugins | Codex | >= 0.128.0 |

Codex `0.117.0+` no longer reads `.codex/prompts/`; agi-cli converts slash commands into skills so they stay invocable as `$name`. OpenCode's plugin-based hook system is on the roadmap; hooks stay `no` until a writer ships.

Slash commands can declare per-agent/version targeting in frontmatter (`agents:`, `since:`, `until:`). Gating applies when syncing from `~/.agents/commands/` (user/system) into version homes — project `.agents/commands/` files are read in place and are not filtered by `agents:`.

## FAQ

### Why use `agents` instead of `claude` / `codex` / `antigravity` directly?

Claude Code, Codex CLI, Antigravity, Grok Build, and others each have their own config format, MCP setup, version management, and skill system. If you use more than one, you maintain N copies of everything. `agents` gives you one interface, one config source, and one place to pin versions -- plus features the individual CLIs don't ship: cross-agent pipelines, shared teams, unified session search, and project-pinned versions like `.nvmrc`.

### Is it free?

Yes — every feature, with no account and no signup. `agents run`, sessions, teams, fleet dispatch, secrets, browser, and computer automation all work the moment you install. The optional `agents auth login` unlocks the hosted surfaces — team spaces (`agents auth space`) and managed trace sync (`agents traces sync`, no Cloudflare setup); there are no paid tiers. This developer tool is entirely free because we believe developers should have the best tools — fast and robust — so they can create the best products for their users.

### Is this like `nvm` / `mise` / `asdf` for AI agents?

For version management, yes. `agi-cli` reads `agents.yaml` from the project root, walks up the directory tree, and routes to the correct binary per project. But it also manages agent-native resources (skills, MCP servers, commands, hooks, permissions) that language version managers don't touch.

### How does version switching actually work?

Same approach as nvm, pyenv, and rbenv — battle-tested by millions of developers. When you install a version, we set up a shim script that resolves the version from `agents.yaml` and runs the right binary. Each version has an isolated config directory. No manual setup required.

### How do I share my agent setup with my team?

Add a `.agents/` directory at your project root with your skills, hooks, rules, and commands. Resources merge automatically: project > user (`~/.agents/`) > system (`~/.agents-system/`). Commit it with your repo and teammates get the same agent environment.

### Do I need to write separate rules for each agent (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, etc.)?

No. Write one `AGENTS.md` — it's the canonical source. We automatically sync it to each agent's expected location (`CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `AGENTS.md` for Antigravity, `.cursorrules` for Cursor). Same content, zero duplication.

### Do agents use API keys or subscriptions?

Your choice. We hand off to the original CLI process — use your existing subscription or API key. This is intentional: subscription pricing is usually cheaper than API token pricing for individual users. Configure each agent however you want.

### Does it store my API keys or send telemetry?

**No CLI telemetry or phone-home.** API keys come from your shell environment or each agent CLI's existing auth, and remote calls only happen when you invoke a feature that requires them, such as cloud dispatch.

For full transparency: `agi-cli` keeps a local event log at `~/.agents/.cache/logs/` so you can see exactly what agents did on your machine. Logs are owner-readable only (0600) and auto-prune after 7 days. Set `AGENTS_DISABLE_EVENT_LOG=1` to disable. See [Security & Privacy](#security--privacy) for details.

### Which platforms?

macOS and Linux. Windows via WSL works but isn't first-class yet.

**macOS-only features:** `agents accounts add` requires macOS. `agents secrets` itself is cross-platform — macOS Keychain, Linux libsecret, or the `file` backend everywhere, including Windows (non-WSL) via environment variables or a `.env` file as a fallback when neither native store applies.

Interactive runs spawn directly by default. Enable `tmux.enabled` on a device to
give each run an addressable pane for `agents message`, injection, and `agents
focus`; tmux-backed runs require tmux 3.2 or newer.

### Do I need Node.js?

The installer tries Bun first (faster), falls back to npm. Node 22.5+ required at runtime.

### Can I use it in CI?

Yes -- `agents run` is non-interactive by default. `--yes` auto-accepts prompts, `--json` for structured output. Pass explicit names and IDs instead of relying on interactive pickers.

The auto-update prompt is suppressed automatically when stdin or stdout isn't a TTY. For headless environments where TTY detection misfires (k8s pods that allocate a PTY for stdout, cloud sandbox factories), set `AGENTS_CLI_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=1` to skip the update check entirely -- no prompt, no network call.

agi-cli also prints a one-time "star us on GitHub" line after your first successful `agents run`/`agents teams`. It's already skipped in CI, non-TTY, `--json`, and `--quiet` runs; set `AGENTS_NO_NUDGE=1` to suppress it everywhere.

To update on demand instead of waiting for the prompt, run `agents upgrade` (add `-y` to skip the confirmation, or pass a version/dist-tag to install something other than latest).

### What happens to my config when I switch versions?

Each version has its own isolated config directory. Switching just repoints a symlink — your per-version config stays untouched. On first migration (if you had a real `~/.claude/` directory before using agi-cli), that gets backed up once to `~/.agents-system/backups/`.

### Does session search use RAG or semantic search?

No — it's a SQLite + FTS5 full-text index. Fast, flexible, and robust. Agents can query sessions programmatically. Most commands support `--json` output for scripting with jq.

### How do I use custom or local models?

Profiles (experimental — available by default). Works with LiteLLM Proxy, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Drop a YAML in `~/.agents/profiles/` pointing to your endpoint.

### Can I add support for a new agent?

Agents are defined in [src/lib/agents.ts](cli/src/lib/agents.ts) -- each is a config object declaring commands dir, rules file, and capabilities. PRs welcome.

### What's the relationship to Phoenix Labs / Rush?

`agi-cli` is an open client maintained by Phoenix Labs. Rush is a separate product. No Rush account required, no upsell.
