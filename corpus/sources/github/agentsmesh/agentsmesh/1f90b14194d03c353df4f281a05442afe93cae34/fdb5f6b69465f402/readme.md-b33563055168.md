## The problem: one operator, a hundred agents

AI coding agents have made individual engineers wildly productive — but individual productivity has a ceiling. The next 10x isn't a smarter agent; it's **running many agents at once**, and directing them like a team.

That ambition breaks the moment you try it for real:

- A hundred agents won't fit on one laptop.
- Nobody can babysit a hundred terminals.
- Each agent needs its own clean, isolated workspace — or they corrupt each other's state.
- Long-running agents stall, get stuck, and silently die.
- Agents working in isolation never compound into a team.

What's missing isn't the agent. It's the **control layer** that turns one operator into the director of an agent workforce — the layer that schedules agents onto machines, isolates them, keeps them alive, lets them collaborate, and puts all of it on one screen.

**AgentsMesh is that layer.**

## From problem to platform

Every part of AgentsMesh exists to answer one question: *how does a single person reliably run, watch, and steer a hundred agents?* Each capability is the direct answer to a wall you hit when you scale.

| The wall you hit | What AgentsMesh gives you |
|---|---|
| 100 agents won't run on one machine | **Runner fleet** — install self-hosted runners across any number of machines. Each advertises its capacity (`max_concurrent_pods`), and agents are scheduled onto the runner you pick or an available one from the pool. Your code never leaves your infrastructure. |
| Every agent needs a clean, isolated environment | **Workspace isolation** — each agent runs in its own pod with a dedicated Git worktree sandbox (`sandboxes/{pod}/workspace/`), private credentials, and its own branch. Concurrent agents never step on each other. |
| You can't watch a hundred terminals | **One console, every screen** — Web, Desktop (Electron), and iOS (SwiftUI) clients, all driven by the *same* Rust core. Paginated pod sidebar, multi-pane workspace, and real-time terminal streaming let one person hold many agents in view. |
| Long-running agents stall and need babysitting | **Autopilot** — a control agent watches a pod and sends the next instruction the moment it goes idle, with iteration caps, decision history, and human takeover/handback. Self-healing, unattended runs. |
| Agents working alone don't compound | **Mesh & Channels** — bind pods together, let them talk over channels with `@mentions`, and watch the collaboration topology update in real time. |

The rest is plumbing built so that chain holds up under load: a **control-plane / data-plane split** — orchestration over gRPC with mTLS, terminal bytes over a stateless Relay cluster — so the backend never bottlenecks on PTY traffic, no matter how many agents are streaming at once.

## Core concepts

- **AgentPod** — one agent's isolated execution environment: a PTY terminal, a Git worktree sandbox, and a real-time output stream.
- **Runner** — a self-hosted daemon you install on your own machines. It connects to the backend over gRPC+mTLS and spawns pods. Register as many as you need; pods schedule across the fleet.
- **Workspace** — the per-pod sandbox: an isolated Git worktree plus private credentials, so concurrent agents never collide and every run is recoverable.
- **Autopilot** — autonomous, self-healing control of a pod by a *control agent*, with iteration limits, decision history, and human takeover at any point.
- **Mesh & Channel** — the collaboration fabric: pods bound into a topology, communicating over channels with `@mentions`.
- **Ticket** — a unit of work on a Kanban board, bindable to a pod with progress and MR/PR tracking.

## Architecture

AgentsMesh separates the **control plane** from the **data plane**: orchestration commands travel over gRPC with mTLS, while terminal I/O streams through a stateless Relay cluster. The backend never touches a single PTY byte — which is what lets the fleet scale.

**Server-side (Go)**

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Backend** | API server (Gin + GORM) — auth, org/team/user, pod lifecycle, tickets, billing, and the PKI that issues runner certs |
| **Relay** | WebSocket relay for the terminal data plane — low-latency pub/sub between runners and clients |
| **Runner** | Self-hosted daemon — connects to the backend (gRPC+mTLS), spawns isolated PTY pods that run the actual agents |

**Client-side**

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Rust Core** | Business-logic SSOT — 10 crates compiled to WASM (web/desktop) and a native dylib via UniFFI (iOS). One cache, one set of services, every client. |
| **Web** | Next.js console — terminal, Kanban, real-time mesh topology |
| **Desktop** | Electron app — reuses the web UI, talks to a native Rust core over NAPI |
| **iOS** | SwiftUI + TCA — the same Rust core via UniFFI bindings |
| **Web-Admin** | Internal admin console — user/org/runner management, audit logs |

## Getting Started

The fastest way to use AgentsMesh is the hosted service at **[agentsmesh.ai](https://agentsmesh.ai)** — sign up, connect your Git provider, and start running agents in minutes. Bring your own AI API keys (**BYOK**): no usage caps, full cost control.

### 1. Install a Runner

The Runner is a lightweight daemon that runs on your machine and executes AI agents locally. Your code stays on your infrastructure. Install one per machine you want in the fleet.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://agentsmesh.ai/install.sh | sh
```

> See the [Runner README](runner/) for more installation options (deb, rpm, Windows, etc.)

### 2. Login

```bash
agentsmesh-runner login
```

This opens your browser to authenticate. For headless environments (SSH, remote server):

```bash
agentsmesh-runner login --headless
```

For self-hosted deployments, add `--server`:

```bash
agentsmesh-runner login --server https://your-server.com
```

### 3. Run

```bash
agentsmesh-runner run
```

Or install as a system service for always-on operation:

```bash
agentsmesh-runner service install
agentsmesh-runner service start
```

Once the runner is online, create an **AgentPod** from any console (Web / Desktop / iOS) and start putting agents to work.

## Quick Start

Run the whole stack locally with one command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgentsMesh/AgentsMesh.git
cd AgentsMesh/deploy/dev
./dev.sh
```

This starts the full stack: PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, Backend, Relay, Traefik, and a local Next.js frontend with hot reload.

**Access:**

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Web Console | http://localhost:3000 |
| API | http://localhost:80/api |

**Test Accounts:**

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| User | dev@agentsmesh.local | devpass123 |
| Admin | admin@agentsmesh.local | adminpass123 |

> Ports are dynamically allocated per worktree. Check `deploy/dev/.env` for actual values.

<summary><strong>Manual Setup</strong></summary>

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.24+, Node.js 20+, pnpm, Docker

```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure
cd deploy/dev && ./dev.sh

# 2. Backend (auto-starts in Docker with hot reload)
docker compose logs -f backend

# 3. Frontend (local with Turbopack)
cd clients/web && pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

Docker images are published to Docker Hub on every push to `main`:

```
agentsmesh/backend:sha-xxxxxxx
agentsmesh/web:sha-xxxxxxx
agentsmesh/web-admin:sha-xxxxxxx
agentsmesh/relay:sha-xxxxxxx
```

Tagged releases (`v*`) get semver tags:

```
agentsmesh/backend:1.0.0
agentsmesh/backend:1.0
```

See [deploy/selfhost/](deploy/selfhost/) for the self-hosted deployment guide.
