## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Auth bootstrap protocol: `AuthManager::bootstrap()` async hydration with
  base_url self-validation, expired-token refresh, identity fetch, and
  cleanup-on-failure semantics. Exposed across WASM / node-bridge / UniFFI
  bindings; web/desktop/iOS frontends drive startup off it instead of the
  legacy `restore_session()` path.
- Per-server storage namespacing: session keys are now scoped to
  `agentsmesh-auth/<url-slug>/session`, allowing the same machine to hold
  independent sessions for dev / staging / prod without cross-server
  contamination.
- Channel @mention with pod prompt forwarding
- ChannelPodManager for managing pod membership in channels
- Loop feature - CI/CD for AI Agent Tasks
- Runner remote upgrade with Poddaemon-aware safety checks
- Backend handler unit tests for runner upgrade endpoint
- Upgrade confirmation dialog with active pod count warning (8 languages)

### Fixed

- **Cross-server account contamination (auth architecture overhaul)**:
  starting v0.31.0 a stale dev token from a prior development session
  could persist across server-preset switches and OAuth re-logins,
  routing the renderer to a phantom dashboard that 502'd into an
  onboarding loop. Root causes: (a) global `STORAGE_KEY` shared across
  all backends, (b) `AuthState` persisted user identity alongside the
  token blob, (c) `AppState::new` auto-`restore_session()`'d without
  base_url validation, (d) `RootRedirect` keyed off `user.id` instead
  of token freshness, (e) `ServerSettingsModal` switched servers
  without logout, (f) `OAuthCallbackPage` left a placeholder auth
  state if `/users/me` failed. Fixed by introducing the bootstrap
  protocol (see Added) and per-server storage namespaces; identity is
  no longer persisted, only the access/refresh-token + base_url +
  user_id triple plus the org-slug preference.
