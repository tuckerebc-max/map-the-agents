# Freebuff

English | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

**Five free AI products for coding, building, and research.** No subscription, credits, or API key required.

[Freebuff](https://freebuff.com) brings specialized agents and a choice of leading models to your terminal, desktop, browser, and GitHub repositories. Text ads support access to the included models.

## Quick start

Run Freebuff in any project from your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g freebuff
cd ~/my-project
freebuff
```

Then describe what you want. Freebuff finds the relevant files, makes changes, and runs the checks that matter for your project.

## Models

Freebuff includes a curated model catalog. The regular picker currently offers:

| Model                       | Access                  | Best for                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GLM 5.3 Flash**           | Full and limited access | The default everywhere; deepest reasoning, unmetered              |
| **DeepSeek V4.1 Flash** | Full and limited access | Fast coding and tool use, unmetered                               |
| **GPT-5.6 Luna**            | Full access             | Strong all-around with native images                              |
| **MiMo 2.5**                | Full and limited access | Balanced performance with image support                           |
| **Solar Pro 4**             | Full and limited access | Limited-time trial; 524K context, text only; unmetered at full access |
| **Muse Spark 1.2**          | Full access             | Meta's agentic coding model; 1M context. Rate limited and shared by every user, so it queues when busy and answers on DeepSeek V4 Flash rather than making you wait |

Most models draw on your normal daily sessions rather than a separate limit. GLM 5.3 Flash, DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, MiMo 2.5 and Solar Pro 4 are unmetered at full access and cost no session at all. Models may still serve from a quantized (Q8_0) build.

DeepSeek V4 Pro was retired from the catalog; GLM 5.3 Flash replaces it as the deep-reasoning pick.

Beyond the regular picker:

- **Referrals and bounties** earn extra sessions on top of the free daily allowance.
- **Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite** powers specialist tasks such as file finding and research rather than appearing in the main picker.

Availability and limits depend on your access tier, product, and current capacity. Freebuff Desktop can also run locally installed Claude Code and Codex agents using your existing provider account; those connected models are separate from Freebuff's included catalog.

## How Freebuff works

Freebuff uses specialized agents instead of sending every task through one model and one prompt. Depending on the task, agents gather context, plan, edit or research, run tools, and review the result.

- **Codebase context** — File-finding agents map the relevant parts of a project before editing.
- **Implementation and review** — Agents can divide work, make changes, run commands, and inspect the result.
- **Research and browser use** — Agents can investigate documentation and test applications in a real browser.
- **Parallel local work** — Desktop isolates concurrent agents in separate workspaces.
- **Hosted environments** — Web and Cloud provide sandboxes, previews, terminals, and deployment workflows.

## Free access

Freebuff is available in every country. Supported regions receive full access; other regions and VPN users receive limited access to GLM 5.3 Flash, DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, MiMo 2.5, and Solar Pro 4. Accounts on Freebucks use the displayed model price and balance. On the legacy session system, limited access includes six one-hour sessions per day, earnable up to seven; GLM uses earned reward sessions instead.

Text ads support the included models. Freebuff shows the applicable session limits and any model-specific data-use notice before you start.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED FREEBUFF DATA USE -->

**Is my data used to train AI?** Only when a model or feature says data may be used for AI training. Freebuff or the provider may then keep submissions to develop, train, test, evaluate, fine-tune, and improve AI models or products.

**How is my data used and stored?** We use prompts, messages, agent traces, code, files, and repository data to provide Freebuff. We may analyze prompts and messages to personalize ads. We do not give separately uploaded files or connected repositories to advertising providers. Restricted partners may evaluate connected Cloud repositories or code used with models labeled “May use data for AI training,” but cannot otherwise use, broadly share, or train on it. See the Privacy Policy for retention, eligibility, and advertising choices.

## Contributing

Freebuff is a TypeScript monorepo built with Bun. Contributions to the products, agents, tools, documentation, and underlying runtime are welcome.

Local development requires Docker and a configured `.env.local`; see the
[Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting the services.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodebuffAI/freebuff.git
cd freebuff
bun install
bun up
```

Start the CLI separately with:

```bash
bun start-cli
```

See the [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md), [development guide](./docs/development.md), and [testing guide](./docs/testing.md) for environment setup and the checks to run before opening a pull request.

## Built on Codebuff

Freebuff is built on [Codebuff](https://codebuff.com), the open multi-agent framework that powers its orchestration, tools, and SDK. To create custom agents or embed them in another application, see the [Codebuff documentation](https://codebuff.com/docs) and [`@codebuff/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codebuff/sdk).
