## Getting Started

Prerequisites: [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

To pull and launch Explorer, run the following commands:

```
# install Invariant package
pip install invariant-ai

# pull and launch Explorer application
invariant explorer
```

You can then access your Explorer instance via `http://localhost`. Data will be stored at `./data` of the current working directory.

## Development Setup

To get started, run the following command. Make sure you first install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

To run the setup locally:

```bash
./run.sh up
```

To open the Explorer interface go to `http://localhost`.
This will automatically launch a local Explorer instance on your machine.

All data will be stored in `./data`. To reset the data, simply delete the `./data` directory.

### Add dependencies

If new dependencies are needed for `api` or `tester`, add them to respectively `app-api/requirements.in` or `tests/requirements.in`. Then run,

```bash
./run.sh compile-requirements
```

### Tests

To run tests locally first turn off the app,

```bash
./run.sh down
```

And then run tests

```bash
./run.sh tests-local
./run.sh down
```

The `./run.sh down` teardown the testing environment fully. Needed to run `./run.sh up`. You can skip it if you are planning on run tests again.

You can run tests in a folder:

```
./run.sh tests-local test-ui
```

You can run tests in a file:

```
./run.sh tests-local test-ui/test_basic.py
```

You can run a particular test within a file:

```
./run.sh tests-local test-ui/test_basic.py::test_policy
```

#### Showing the logs

To show the logs of the services, run the following command:

```bash
./run.sh logs
```

This will continuously show the logs of the services. To stop showing the logs, press `Ctrl+C`.
