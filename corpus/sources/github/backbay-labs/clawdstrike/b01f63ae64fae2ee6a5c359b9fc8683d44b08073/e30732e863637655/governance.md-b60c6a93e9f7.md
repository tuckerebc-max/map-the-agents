# ClawdStrike Governance

## Current Model: BDFL + Maintainer Council

ClawdStrike uses a Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) governance model with
a Maintainer Council for the initial phase of the project.

### BDFL

The BDFL has final authority on all project decisions.

- **Current BDFL:** Connor (GitHub: @bb-connor)

### Maintainer Council

Maintainers have commit access and review authority within their component areas.

| Maintainer | Component Area            | GitHub |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------ |
| (TBD)      | Guards / Policy Engine    |        |
| (TBD)      | Spine Protocol            |        |
| (TBD)      | Desktop / SDK             |        |
| (TBD)      | Bridges / Infrastructure  |        |
| (TBD)      | Documentation / Community |        |

### Decision Process

1. **Minor changes** (bug fixes, docs, typos): Single maintainer approval
2. **Feature additions** (new guards, adapters): Maintainer approval + CI pass
3. **Architecture changes** (new crates, protocol changes): RFC required
4. **Security-sensitive changes** (crypto, guard logic, Spine protocol): Two maintainer reviews
5. **Governance changes**: BDFL approval

### RFC Process

Significant design decisions are documented as ADRs in `docs/plans/decisions/`:

1. Author opens a PR adding `docs/plans/decisions/NNNN-title.md`
2. Community comment period: 14 days minimum
3. Maintainer Council discusses in weekly call
4. BDFL approves, requests changes, or rejects
5. Approved RFCs are merged and implementation can begin

| Documentation     | `docs/`                   | Any maintainer       |
| Helm chart        | `infra/deploy/helm/`      | Bridges maintainer   |

### Becoming a Maintainer

Maintainer candidates are nominated by existing maintainers based on:

- Sustained, high-quality contributions (6+ merged PRs)
- Demonstrated understanding of the codebase and design philosophy
- Constructive participation in reviews and discussions
- Alignment with the project's fail-closed security philosophy

The BDFL approves all maintainer additions.

## Future Evolution

### Phase 2: Steering Committee (12-24 months)

When the contributor base grows beyond the founding team:

- Transition to a 5-member elected Steering Committee
- BDFL retains veto on security-critical decisions only
- Sub-teams form around components with designated leads
- Annual elections for Steering Committee seats

### Phase 3: CNCF Sandbox (24+ months)

Requirements for CNCF Sandbox application:

- 2+ maintainers from different organizations
- Apache 2.0 license (completed)
- Adopt CNCF governance template
- Security audit completed
- 3+ production adopters
