# Embabel Coding Agent

Headless coding agent built on Embabel agent platform, for use in developing Embabel and
as an open source project in its own right.

## Aims

This project aims to provide a full-fledged coding agent that means the
Embabel team's work is accelerated by AI, yet without the use of any commercial
coding agents.

Key capabilities include:

- Explaining code
- Creating new projects using Embabel
- Making code changes across multiple files
- Writing documentation
- Combining access to project code with internet access: for example, to research new APIs.

> This project is in an early stage of development.

## Futures

- Support for build systems other than Maven
- Better project selection.
- Enhanced language support. See `SymbolSearch`
- Understanding libraries in use via accessing source code, via maven repositories
- Further effort to reduce token usage
- Integration with Spring repository to allow choice of project to work on
- Deep integration with GitHub to allow presentation of changes via PR
- Automated review of PRs
- (possible) chat mode to allow interaction with agent during a process flow

## Using this project

Coder will find Maven projects under peer directories of the directory in which it is started.

Run with the shell. The following commands are available. Note that some commands require a lengthy string to be
enclosed in double quotes.

- `set-focus <project>`: Focus on a project, e.g. `focus embabel-agent`. The string must match the last path segment of
  the project name, e.g. `embabel-agent-api`.
- `focus`: Show the current focus project.
- `chat`: Enter chat mode, where you can ask the agent to perform tasks such as explaining code or modifying it.

> Chat presently has no memory, so it will not remember the context of previous messages.
