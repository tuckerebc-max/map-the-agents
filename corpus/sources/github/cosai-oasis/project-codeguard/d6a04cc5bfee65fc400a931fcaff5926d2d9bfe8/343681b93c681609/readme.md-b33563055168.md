This repository is for the work of the **Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI)**. CoSAI is an [OASIS Open Project](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/) and an open ecosystem of AI and security experts from industry-leading organizations. We are dedicated to sharing best practices for secure AI deployment and collaborating on AI security research and tool development.

## What is Project CodeGuard?
[Project CodeGuard](https://project-codeguard.org/) is an AI model-agnostic security coding agent skills framework and ruleset that embeds secure-by-default practices into AI coding workflows (generation and review). It ships core security skills and rules, translators for popular coding agents, and validators to test skills and rule compliance.


## Why Project CodeGuard?

AI coding agents are transforming software engineering, but this speed can introduce security vulnerabilities. Is your AI coding agent implementation introducing security vulnerabilities?

- Skipping input validation
- Hardcoding secrets and credentials
- Using weak cryptographic algorithms
- Relying on unsafe functions
- Missing authentication/authorization checks
- Missing any other security best practice

Project CodeGuard solves this by embedding security best practices directly into AI coding agent workflows. 

**During and After Code Generation.**

Project CodeGuard is designed to integrate seamlessly across the entire AI coding lifecycle. 
- **Before code generation**, skills and rules can be used for the design of a product and for spec-driven development. You can use the skills and rules in the “planning phase” of an AI coding agent to steer models toward secure patterns from the start.
- **During code generation**, skills and rules can help AI agents to prevent security issues as code is being written.
- **After code generation**, AI agents like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Windsurf, and Claude Code can use the rules for code review. 


## Security Coverage

Project CodeGuard skills and rules cover essential security domains:

- **Cryptography**: Safe algorithms (including post-quantum cryptography), secure key management, certificate validation
- **Input Validation**: SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, command injection defense
- **Authentication**: MFA best practices, OAuth/OIDC, secure session management
- **Authorization**: RBAC/ABAC, access control, IDOR prevention
- **Supply Chain**: Dependency security, SBOM generation, vulnerability management
- **Cloud Security**: IaC hardening, container security, Kubernetes best practices
- **Platform Security**: Mobile apps, web services, API security
- **Data Protection**: Privacy, encryption at rest/transit, secure storage

## Quick Start

Get started in minutes:

1. **Download the skills and rules** from our [releases page](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/releases)
2. **Copy to your project** - Place AI agent and IDE specific skills and rules in your repository
3. **Start coding** - AI assistants will automatically follow security best practices

- Additional details in the [Get Started →](https://project-codeguard.org/getting-started/)


## CodeGuard MCP Server

This repository also includes an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that exposes all CodeGuard security rules as tools over streamable HTTP. Organizations can deploy it on their infrastructure and connect every developer's AI coding assistant to a single, centrally managed instance. See the [CodeGuard MCP Server README](src/codeguard-mcp/README.md) for setup instructions.


## How It Works

1. **Security skills and rules** are written in unified markdown format (`sources/` directory)
2. **Conversion tools** translate skills and rules into formats for popular coding agents
3. **Release automation** packages skills and rules into downloadable ZIP files
4. **AI assistants** reference these skills and rules when generating or reviewing code
5. **Secure code** is produced automatically without developer intervention
