# CodeGuard Claude Code Plugin

## Overview

This document explains how Project CodeGuard is packaged as a Claude Code plugin (Agent Skill) and how to use it effectively in your AI-assisted coding workflows.

Project CodeGuard is an **open-source, model-agnostic security framework** that embeds secure-by-default practices into AI coding workflows. The plugin makes it easy to integrate these security rules with Claude Code.

## What is an Agent Skill?

Agent Skills are model-invoked capabilities that Claude autonomously uses based on task context. The CodeGuard security skill provides comprehensive security guidance that Claude applies automatically when writing, reviewing, or modifying code.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed with `/plugin` support
- Basic familiarity with Claude Code's plugin system

!!! warning "Trust note"
    Claude Code plugins can provide skills, agents, hooks, MCP servers, and executable components. Only install marketplaces and plugins from sources you trust.

### Installation Steps

1. **Add the Project CodeGuard marketplace:**
   ```text
   /plugin marketplace add cosai-oasis/project-codeguard
   ```

2. **Install the security plugin:**
   ```text
   /plugin install codeguard-security@project-codeguard
   ```

3. **Reload plugins:**
   ```text
   /reload-plugins
   ```

4. **Verify installation:**
   Open `/plugin` and check the **Installed** tab. `codeguard-security@project-codeguard` should be listed and enabled.

## How It Works

The CodeGuard skill integrates **23 security rule files** covering all major security domains across languages, frameworks, and technology stacks. The skill follows a simple but powerful workflow:

### Skill Activation

The skill activates automatically when:
- Writing new code in any language
- Reviewing or modifying existing code
- Implementing security-sensitive features (authentication, cryptography, data handling)
- Working with user input, databases, APIs, or external services
- Configuring cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, or containers
- Handling sensitive data, credentials, or cryptographic operations

### Security Workflow

When generating or reviewing code, Claude follows this 3-step workflow:

**1. Initial Security Check**
- Will this handle credentials? → Apply `codeguard-1-hardcoded-credentials`
- What language is being used? → Identify applicable language-specific rules
- What security domains are involved? → Load relevant rule files

**2. Code Generation**
- Apply secure-by-default patterns from relevant CodeGuard rules
- Add security-relevant comments explaining choices

**3. Security Review**
- Review against implementation checklists in each rule
- Verify no hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Validate that all applicable rules have been followed
- Explain which security rules were applied
- Highlight security features implemented

### Rule Categories

**Always-Apply Rules** (3 critical rules checked on every code operation):
- `codeguard-1-hardcoded-credentials` - Never hardcode secrets or credentials
- `codeguard-1-crypto-algorithms` - Use modern cryptographic algorithms
- `codeguard-1-digital-certificates` - Validate certificate security

**Context-Specific Rules** (20 rules applied based on technology and features):
- Input validation, authentication, authorization, APIs, data storage, privacy, logging, cryptography, file handling, serialization, supply chain, DevOps, cloud, Kubernetes, IaC, frameworks, mobile security, and memory safety (C/C++)

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Writing Database Code

```python
# Claude will automatically use parameterized queries
def get_user(email):
    # Secure pattern following codeguard-0-input-validation-injection
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?"
    return cursor.execute(query, (email,))
```

### Example 2: Handling API Keys

```javascript
// Claude will prevent hardcoded credentials
// and suggest environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.STRIPE_API_KEY;
if (!apiKey) {
  throw new Error("STRIPE_API_KEY not configured");
}
```

### Example 3: Password Hashing

```python
# Claude will suggest modern password hashing
from argon2 import PasswordHasher
ph = PasswordHasher()
password_hash = ph.hash(password)
```

### Example 4: File Upload Security

```javascript
// Claude will enforce file validation
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({
  limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 }, // 5MB limit
  fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
    // Validate file type by content, not just extension
    if (file.mimetype.startsWith('image/')) {
      cb(null, true);
    } else {
      cb(new Error('Only images allowed'));
    }
  }
});
```

## Team Deployment

For teams, make CodeGuard available through repository settings:

1. Add to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
       "project-codeguard": {
         "source": {
           "source": "github",
           "repo": "cosai-oasis/project-codeguard"
         }
       }
     },
     "enabledPlugins": {
       "codeguard-security@project-codeguard": true
     }
   }
   ```

2. Team members trust the repository folder

3. Claude Code prompts team members to install and enable CodeGuard

For managed environments, administrators can restrict allowed marketplaces with `strictKnownMarketplaces`.

## All Security Rules

The plugin includes 23 comprehensive security rules organized into two categories:

### Always-Apply Rules (3 rules)

These critical rules are checked on **every** code operation:

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `codeguard-1-hardcoded-credentials` | Prevent secrets, passwords, API keys, tokens in source code |
| `codeguard-1-crypto-algorithms` | Ban weak algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, DES); use modern alternatives |
| `codeguard-1-digital-certificates` | Validate certificate expiration, key strength, signature algorithms |

### Context-Specific Rules (20 rules)

These rules apply based on the programming language, framework, or feature being implemented. Claude automatically selects relevant rules based on context:

| Security Domain | Rules |
|-----------------|-------|
| **Input & Injection** | `codeguard-0-input-validation-injection` |
| **Authentication** | `codeguard-0-authentication-mfa` |
| **Authorization** | `codeguard-0-authorization-access-control` |
| **Sessions** | `codeguard-0-session-management-and-cookies` |
| **APIs & Web** | `codeguard-0-api-web-services`, `codeguard-0-client-side-web-security` |
| **Data & Privacy** | `codeguard-0-data-storage`, `codeguard-0-privacy-data-protection`, `codeguard-0-logging` |
| **Cryptography** | `codeguard-0-additional-cryptography` |
| **Files & Serialization** | `codeguard-0-file-handling-and-uploads`, `codeguard-0-xml-and-serialization` |
| **Infrastructure** | `codeguard-0-supply-chain-security`, `codeguard-0-devops-ci-cd-containers`, `codeguard-0-cloud-orchestration-kubernetes`, `codeguard-0-iac-security` |
| **Platforms** | `codeguard-0-framework-and-languages`, `codeguard-0-mobile-apps` |
| **Memory Safety (C/C++)** | `codeguard-0-safe-c-functions` |
| **MCP Security** | `codeguard-0-mcp-security` |

> **Note:** Each rule file contains detailed guidance, checklists, and examples. Claude references these automatically based on the code context.

## Updating

To refresh the CodeGuard marketplace listing:

```text
/plugin marketplace update project-codeguard
```

To update the installed plugin from a shell:

```bash
claude plugin update codeguard-security@project-codeguard
```

Restart Claude Code after updating. If an open session prompts you to reload plugin changes, run `/reload-plugins`.

You can also run `/plugin`, open the **Marketplaces** tab, select `project-codeguard`, and enable auto-update.

## Customization

### Disabling the Plugin

If needed, temporarily disable:

```text
/plugin disable codeguard-security@project-codeguard
```

Re-enable:

```text
/plugin enable codeguard-security@project-codeguard
```

Run `/reload-plugins` after changing plugin state.

### Using Specific Rule Files

All rule files are available in the `skills/codeguard/rules/` directory within the plugin. You can reference specific rules in prompts:

```
Claude, please review this authentication code against the 
codeguard-0-authentication-mfa.md guidelines
```

### Creating Custom Workflows

You can create custom security review workflows:

```
Claude, perform the following security checks on this code:
1. Check for hardcoded credentials
2. Validate input sanitization
3. Verify authentication implementation
4. Review authorization logic
Use the relevant CodeGuard rules for each check.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Loading

1. Verify installation: `/plugin` → **Installed**
2. Check that `codeguard-security@project-codeguard` is listed and enabled
3. Run `/reload-plugins`

### Rules Not Being Applied

1. Confirm the plugin is enabled
2. Try explicitly mentioning security in your prompt
3. Check that you're working with supported languages

### Checking Plugin Version

Open `/plugin` and check the **Installed** tab. Look for `codeguard-security@project-codeguard` and note the version number.

## Best Practices

### During Development

1. **Trust the automation**: Let Claude apply security rules automatically
2. **Learn from suggestions**: When Claude suggests secure alternatives, understand why
3. **Ask for explanations**: Request Claude to explain security recommendations
4. **Use proactive security**: Ask Claude for security guidance before implementing features

### During Code Review

1. **Explicit security review**: Ask Claude to perform comprehensive security analysis
2. **Reference specific rules**: Mention rule names for focused review (e.g., "Review against codeguard-0-authentication-mfa")
3. **Check always-apply rules**: Ensure credentials, crypto algorithms, certificates, and C functions are handled securely
4. **Validate workflow**: Confirm that Claude followed the 3-step security workflow

### For Teams

1. **Standardize installation**: Use `.claude/settings.json` for consistent setup across the team
2. **Version control**: Track which plugin version your team uses
3. **Update regularly**: Keep rules current with latest security guidance
4. **Share learnings**: Document security patterns specific to your stack
5. **Train developers**: Ensure team members understand how to work with AI-assisted security

## Building the Plugin

If you're contributing to Project CodeGuard or need to rebuild the plugin:

```bash
cd /path/to/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard

# Regenerate the Claude Code plugin (always uses core rules only)
uv run python src/convert_to_ide_formats.py
```

This command:
- Converts unified rules from `sources/` to IDE-specific formats
- Generates `skills/` directory with the 23 core security rules (Claude Code plugin)
- Creates `dist/` with all supported agent-specific formats

**Note:** The Claude Code plugin (`skills/`) uses the curated core rules. To build bundles with OWASP supplementary rules for other IDEs, use `--source core owasp`, but this only affects `dist/`, not `skills/`.

### Local Development

To test the plugin from a local checkout without installing it:

```bash
uv run python src/convert_to_ide_formats.py
claude --plugin-dir .
```

`--plugin-dir` loads the local plugin for that Claude Code session. If the session is already running and you regenerate files, run `/reload-plugins`.

## Advanced Usage

### Language-Specific Security Reviews

Request focused reviews for specific languages:

```
Claude, perform a security review of this Python code with emphasis on:
- SQL injection prevention
- Input validation
- Authentication best practices
```

### Feature-Specific Guidance

Get proactive security guidance when building features:

```
Claude, I'm about to implement a file upload feature. 
What security considerations should I keep in mind 
according to CodeGuard rules?
```

### Security-First Development

Use CodeGuard from the planning phase:

```
Claude, help me design a secure authentication system for a web app.
Use CodeGuard rules to guide the architecture.
```

### How Claude Uses the Skill

When you write or review code, Claude follows this workflow:

1. **Reads SKILL.md** - Understands when to activate the skill and what workflow to follow
2. **Initial Security Check** - Identifies which rules apply based on:
   - Whether credentials are involved (always-apply rule)
   - The programming language in use
   - The security domains involved (auth, crypto, APIs, etc.)
3. **Applies Security Rules** - References relevant rule files to:
   - Use secure-by-default patterns
   - Follow implementation checklists
   - Apply language-specific guidance
4. **Generates Secure Code** - Produces code that:
   - Never hardcodes credentials
   - Uses modern cryptographic algorithms
   - Implements input validation
   - Follows security best practices
5. **Provides Explanations** - Documents which security rules were applied and highlights security features implemented
