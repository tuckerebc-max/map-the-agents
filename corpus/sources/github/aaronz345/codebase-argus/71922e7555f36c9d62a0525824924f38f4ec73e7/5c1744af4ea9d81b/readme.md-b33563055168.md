Codebase Argus gives maintainers a review desk for codebase evidence. It reviews
pull requests, failing CI logs, and long-lived fork syncs with the same set of
signals: patches, checks, files, branch state, policy gates, provider consensus,
and local git simulations.

Use it when a single reviewer is not enough, but a fully automatic merge bot is
too risky. Argus can ask one model, several models, or local AI CLIs to review
the same evidence, then keeps every finding tied to something a maintainer can
check.

## Try it on a public PR

The shortest useful path is a local, read-only review. No model key is needed for the deterministic pass.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AaronZ345/codebase-argus.git
cd codebase-argus
npm ci
npm run argus -- review zhayujie/CowAgent#2965
```

To give the same evidence to an installed Codex CLI:

```bash
npm run argus -- review zhayujie/CowAgent#2965 --provider codex-cli
```

The [CowAgent #2965 case study](docs/case-studies/cowagent-2965.md) records both passes: low risk, no blocking issue, and one remaining integration-test boundary for a maintainer to judge.

## Run it in pull requests

The companion [Codebase Argus Action](https://github.com/AaronZ345/codebase-argus-action) puts the deterministic review in a workflow job summary. It is read-only by default and needs no model key.

```yaml
- uses: AaronZ345/codebase-argus-action@v1
  with:
    pull-request: ${{ github.repository }}#${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
```

The Action also exposes failing-CI diagnosis, autofix planning, optional agent providers, and a pinned `core-ref`.

## At a glance

| Workflow | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR review | `owner/repo#123` or a GitHub PR URL | risk summary, findings, inline-ready comments |
| CI review | local log file or failing GitHub Actions jobs | likely root cause, affected command, fix path |
| Autofix plan | PR review findings | gated branch plan for mechanical fixes |
| Downstream fork sync | upstream repo + fork repo | ahead/behind, conflict notes, rebase/merge risk |
| Agent handoff | dashboard or CLI report | task package with commands and acceptance gates |

## Common workflows

### Review a risky PR with multiple agents

```bash
npm run argus -- review owner/repo#123 --tribunal openai-api,claude-cli,codex-cli
```

Argus fetches the PR metadata, changed files, checks, reviews, commits, and
patch excerpts, then asks every configured reviewer to look at the same context.
Matching findings are grouped so agreement is visible; provider failures stay in
the report instead of disappearing.

### Debug failing GitHub Actions logs

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=... npm run argus -- ci-github owner/repo#123 --provider codex-cli
```

The CI lane pulls failing job logs from GitHub Actions and asks for the first
failing command, likely root cause, affected files, and the smallest fix path.

### Check whether a fork can safely rebase

```bash
npm run argus -- downstream owner/upstream me/fork --fork-branch feature/demo --tribunal codex-cli,claude-cli,gemini-cli
```

The downstream lane compares the fork with upstream, projects merge conflicts
with `git merge-tree`, simulates a rebase in a temporary worktree, checks
patch-equivalent commits with `git cherry`, and summarizes semantic movement
with `git range-diff`.

## Run the dashboard locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

For command-line review:

```bash
npm run argus -- review owner/repo#123
npm run argus -- ci-github owner/repo#123
npm run argus -- downstream owner/upstream me/fork
```

Public GitHub repositories work from the hosted demo. Private repositories,
server-side AI providers, GitHub App webhooks, local git analysis, and CLI agent
review belong in a local or deployed server environment.

## Core capabilities

### Pull request review

Codebase Argus fetches the PR shape that maintainers usually need before
trusting a review:

- metadata, labels, author, branch refs, and mergeability;
- changed files, patch excerpts, commits, and prior reviews;
- check status and GitHub Actions run metadata;
- policy rules from `.codebase-argus.yml`;
- stacked PR signals and merge-queue states.

The deterministic reviewer looks for failing checks, source changes without
tests, workflow edits, dependency changes, sensitive paths, policy violations,
large diffs, stacked PR bases, and blocked/dirty/behind/unstable merge states.

### Multi-agent review and tribunal

The same upstream or downstream evidence package can go to one provider or
several providers:

| Provider | Mode |
| --- | --- |
| `openai-api` | API |
| `anthropic-api` | API |
| `gemini-api` | API |
| `codex-cli` | local CLI |
| `claude-cli` | local CLI |
| `gemini-cli` | local CLI |

Tribunal mode runs multiple reviewers against the same PR, CI log, or fork sync
context. It groups matching findings, raises confidence when providers agree,
and keeps provider failures in the report.

### CI failures

Use `ci-log` for a local file, or `ci-github` for failing GitHub Actions jobs on
a PR. Webhook mode can include failing Actions logs in the automatic PR review.

### Autofix planning

`autofix-plan` turns high-confidence, mechanical findings into a branch plan. It
covers narrow lanes such as npm lockfile refreshes, snapshot updates, and
formatter or linter fixes. The output includes commands, verification gates, and
push instructions for the maintainer or agent working in a real checkout.

### Downstream fork sync

The fork workflow compares an upstream repository and a long-lived fork. Local
analysis runs git in `.cache/repos` and temporary worktrees, then reports:

- projected merge conflicts from `git merge-tree`;
- rebase simulation in a temporary worktree;
- patch-equivalent commits from `git cherry`;
- semantic movement from `git range-diff`;
- fork-ahead commits already covered upstream;
- agent-safe merge/rebase runbooks.

## CLI

The CLI is the best entry point for scripts and coding agents.

```bash
npm run argus -- --help
```

### PR review

```bash
npm run argus -- review owner/repo#123
npm run argus -- review owner/repo#123 --policy .codebase-argus.yml
npm run argus -- review owner/repo#123 --provider openai-api --model gpt-4.1-mini
npm run argus -- review owner/repo#123 --tribunal openai-api,claude-cli,codex-cli
```

### CI review

```bash
npm run argus -- ci-log logs/failure.txt
npm run argus -- ci-log logs/failure.txt --provider codex-cli
GITHUB_TOKEN=... npm run argus -- ci-github owner/repo#123
```

### Autofix plan

```bash
npm run argus -- autofix-plan owner/repo#123
```

### Downstream fork sync

```bash
npm run argus -- downstream owner/upstream me/fork
npm run argus -- downstream owner/upstream me/fork --upstream-branch main --fork-branch feature/demo
npm run argus -- downstream owner/upstream me/fork --fork-branch feature/demo --provider codex-cli
```

### Sync planning

```bash
npm run argus -- sync owner/upstream me/fork --mode merge --fork-branch feature/demo --test "npm test"
npm run argus -- sync owner/upstream me/fork --mode rebase --fork-branch feature/demo --execute --push --create-pr
```

Output defaults to markdown. Use `--format json` for tool integration.

Install the binary locally:

```bash
npm link
codebase-argus review owner/repo#123
codebase-argus autofix-plan owner/repo#123
```

`downstream` is the primary fork-sync review command. `sync` is reserved for
explicit integration branches.

## Policy file

Add `.codebase-argus.yml` when the repository has local review rules:

```yaml
requiredChecks: passing
maxChangedFiles: 30
maxTotalDelta: 1200
requiredTestPatterns:
  - .test.ts
forbiddenWorkflowPatterns:
  - pull_request_target
sensitivePathPatterns:
  - auth
  - token
  - webhook
```

Policy failures become normal findings with concrete evidence.

## GitHub App

Deploy the Next.js server and point a GitHub App webhook at:

```text
POST https://your-host.example.com/api/github/webhook
```

The server also emits a GitHub App manifest:

```text
GET https://your-host.example.com/api/github/app-manifest
```

Recommended repository permissions:

| Permission | Access |
| --- | --- |
| Pull requests | Read and write |
| Issues | Read and write |
| Contents | Read |
| Checks | Read |
| Actions | Read |
| Metadata | Read |

Required webhook events:

- `pull_request`
- `issue_comment`

Server environment:

```bash
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...
GITHUB_APP_ID=...
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY='<escaped-pem-private-key>'
```

Base64 private key storage is also supported:

```bash
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64=...
```

Review controls:

```bash
ARGUS_WEBHOOK_PROVIDER=rule-based
ARGUS_WEBHOOK_PROVIDER=openai-api
ARGUS_WEBHOOK_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
ARGUS_WEBHOOK_TRIBUNAL=openai-api,claude-cli,codex-cli
ARGUS_WEBHOOK_INLINE_COMMENTS=true
ARGUS_WEBHOOK_INCLUDE_CI_LOGS=true
ARGUS_WEBHOOK_DRY_RUN=true
```

Webhook behavior:

- verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256` before payload handling;
- reviews `opened`, `reopened`, `ready_for_review`, and `synchronize` events;
- skips draft PRs and PRs labeled `argus:paused`;
- uses GitHub App installation tokens when app credentials are present;
- posts GitHub PR reviews with event `COMMENT`;
- anchors high-signal findings to changed patch lines when inline comments are enabled;
- fetches failing GitHub Actions job logs when checks fail.

### PR comment commands

```text
/argus help
/argus review
/argus ci
/argus autofix
/argus pause
/argus resume
```

`/argus pause` applies the `argus:paused` label. `/argus resume` removes it.
`/argus autofix` posts the same gated plan as the CLI.

## AI provider setup

Set credentials for the providers you plan to use:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

Optional model overrides:

```bash
ARGUS_OPENAI_API_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
ARGUS_ANTHROPIC_API_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
ARGUS_GEMINI_API_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash
```

Local CLI providers expect authenticated commands:

```bash
codex exec --help
claude --help
gemini --help
```

## Agent playbook

The repository includes a portable agent playbook. It is not tied to Codex:
OpenClaw, Codex, Claude Code, and other coding agents can all use the same
instructions.

```text
agent-playbooks/codebase-argus/PLAYBOOK.md   # portable OpenClaw / Codex / Claude Code playbook
skills/codebase-argus/SKILL.md               # ClawHub/OpenClaw-compatible skill entrypoint
```

Recommended setup:

- OpenClaw: add `agent-playbooks/codebase-argus/PLAYBOOK.md` to the agent or
  project instructions, or install the skill from `skills/codebase-argus/`.
- Codex: either read the portable playbook directly or install the skill
  from `skills/codebase-argus/`.
- Claude Code: install the plugin marketplace from this repository:

  ```text
  /plugin marketplace add AaronZ345/codebase-argus
  /plugin install codebase-argus@codebase-argus
  ```

  Or copy the playbook into `.claude/skills/codebase-argus/SKILL.md` for a
  project-local skill.

## Skill registries

Codebase Argus is packaged for open `SKILL.md` registries and agent-specific
install surfaces:

- Claude Code plugin marketplace: `AaronZ345/codebase-argus`
- ClawHub/OpenClaw skill folder: `skills/codebase-argus`
- Codex/OpenAI-compatible Agent Skills folder: `skills/codebase-argus`
- SkillsMD public registry repository: `AaronZ345/codebase-argus`

ClawHub publish command:

```bash
clawhub skill publish skills/codebase-argus \
  --slug codebase-argus \
  --name "Codebase Argus" \
  --version 0.1.0 \
  --tags latest,code-review,pull-request,ci,multi-agent,fork-sync
```

SkillsMD submission payload:

```json
{
  "repo": "AaronZ345/codebase-argus",
  "name": "codebase-argus",
  "description": "Multi-agent PR, CI, and downstream fork-sync review desk for coding agents."
}
```

The playbook directs agents to use the CLI first, keep tokens out of logs, run
multi-provider review before risky downstream integration, and ask for explicit
authorization before approve, merge, rebase, push, PR creation, or GitHub
comments.

## Write model

Codebase Argus keeps write operations narrow:

| Surface | Write behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Hosted demo | Read-only browser inspection |
| Local CLI review | Markdown or JSON output |
| GitHub App review | `COMMENT` PR reviews |
| PR commands | Review, CI review, autofix plan, pause, resume |
| Sync command | Dry-run by default; `--execute`, `--push`, and `--create-pr` are explicit gates |
| Generated Actions workflow | Uses `pull_request` for untrusted fork PRs |
