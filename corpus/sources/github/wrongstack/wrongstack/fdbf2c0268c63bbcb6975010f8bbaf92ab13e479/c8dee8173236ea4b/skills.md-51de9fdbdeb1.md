# Skill Writing Guide

Skills are Markdown files that inject domain-specific knowledge into the agent's system prompt. They activate automatically when the agent detects a matching context — no code required.

---

## Quick start

```
<project>/.wrongstack/skills/
  my-skill/
    SKILL.md        ← this is the only required file
```

A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter. That's it.

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: |
  One-sentence summary of what this skill covers and when to activate it.
  The agent reads this description to decide whether the skill is relevant.
version: 1.0.0
---

# My Skill

Body content injected into the system prompt when the skill activates.
Keep it concise, actionable, and focused on one domain.
```

---

## File format

### Frontmatter (required)

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | ✅ | Unique identifier. Lowercase letters, digits, hyphens; must match the parent directory (agentskills.io). First-seen wins on collisions across layers. |
| `description` | ✅ | One-sentence trigger summary. The agent uses this to decide relevance. |
| `trigger` | ❌ | Explicit "Use when…" trigger shown in the available-skills list. Optional — defaults to the first sentence of `description`. |
| `version` | ❌ | SemVer string. Informational only — not used for comparison. |
| `license` | ❌ | License name or bundled license file (agentskills.io). |
| `compatibility` | ❌ | Environment requirements — intended product, system packages, network (agentskills.io). |
| `metadata` | ❌ | Arbitrary key-value map. |
| `allowed-tools` | ❌ | Space-separated tools (experimental, agentskills.io). Informational only — parsed and displayed, never enforced. |

### Body (required)

Everything after the frontmatter delimiter (`---`) is the skill content. This is injected verbatim into the system prompt when the skill is active. Keep it under 2000 tokens — the system prompt has a budget.

---

## Discovery

Skills are discovered at boot across the layers below. The first layer with a given `name` wins — `.wrongstack` skills shadow foreign and bundled ones.

| Priority | Location | Scope | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (highest) | `<project>/.wrongstack/skills/` | Per-project, committed to git | Repo-specific conventions, build system quirks, team standards |
| 2 | `<project>/.claude/skills/` | Per-project, foreign (read-only) | Skills authored for Claude Code |
| 3 | `<project>/.{codex,cursor,agents,gemini,qwen,trae,windsurf}/skills/` | Per-project, foreign (read-only) | Skills authored for other coding agents (Cursor uses `skills-cursor`) |
| 4 | `~/.wrongstack/profiles/<name>/skills/` | Per-profile, not committed | Profile-specific preferences and habits |
| 5 | `~/.claude/skills/` | Per-user, foreign (read-only) | Your Claude Code user-level skills |
| 6 | `~/.{codex,cursor,agents,gemini,qwen,trae,windsurf}/skills/` | Per-user, foreign (read-only) | Your skills in other coding agents |
| 7 | `config.skills.extraDirs` | User-config only | Any extra directory (stripped from in-project config) |
| 8 (lowest) | Bundled with `@wrongstack/core` | Ships with the package | General-purpose skills (git-flow, bug-hunter, etc.) |

### Directory structure

```
<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md            ← required: metadata + instructions
  scripts/            ← optional: executable code (the agent runs via bash)
  references/         ← optional: docs loaded on demand (REFERENCE.md, …)
  assets/             ← optional: templates, data, snippets
  …                   ← any other files/subdirectories
```

The loader discovers a skill by its `SKILL.md`; the other files are **bundled resources** the agent loads on demand via the `skill` tool (see [Progressive disclosure](#progressive-disclosure--the-skill-tool)). Keep `SKILL.md` under ~500 lines and move deep material into `references/`.

---

## Cross-agent compatibility (`.claude/skills` + other agents)

WrongStack reads skills authored for other coding agents **natively** — no copying required. Every agent below uses the same [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) `SKILL.md` format, so WrongStack discovers and injects them just like a native skill:

| Tool | User dir | Project dir |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills` | `<project>/.claude/skills` |
| OpenAI Codex | `~/.codex/skills` | `<project>/.codex/skills` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/skills-cursor` | `<project>/.cursor/skills-cursor` |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/skills` | `<project>/.gemini/skills` |
| Qwen Code | `~/.qwen/skills` | `<project>/.qwen/skills` |
| Trae | `~/.trae/skills` | `<project>/.trae/skills` |
| Windsurf | `~/.windsurf/skills` | `<project>/.windsurf/skills` |
| Shared (`asm` / agentskills.io) | `~/.agents/skills` | `<project>/.agents/skills` |

All foreign layers are **read-only** — the installer never writes there. To edit or commit a foreign skill, import it with `/skill-import` (below). A skill discovered earlier in the priority order shadows a same-named one discovered later, so `.wrongstack` always wins over foreign; and deduplication is by name, so the same skill symlinked into several agent dirs appears once.

Control which foreign tools are scanned with `skills.foreignSources` (default: all known tools) and `skills.readClaudeSkills` (default: `true`).

## Configuration (`config.skills`)

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `readClaudeSkills` | `true` | Read the `.claude/skills/` layers (project + user). |
| `foreignSources` | `true` (all) | Scan other agents' skill dirs (`~/.codex/skills`, `~/.cursor/skills-cursor`, `~/.agents/skills`, …). Pass a tool-id list to restrict, or `false` to disable. |
| `mode` | `'eager'` | `'eager'` injects every skill body into the prompt; `'progressive'` injects only a name+trigger manifest (the agent loads bodies via the `skill` tool). |
| `eagerMaxChars` | `24000` | In eager mode, the total chars of skill bodies injected (highest-priority first); the rest become a load-on-demand manifest. Bounds prompt cost when many skills are discovered. Ignored in progressive mode. |
| `extraDirs` | `[]` | Extra directories to scan (lowest priority). **User config only** — stripped from a repo-committed `<project>/.wrongstack/config.json`. |

## Progressive disclosure & the `skill` tool

By default (`mode: 'eager'`) discovered skill bodies are injected into the system prompt up to the configured budget. Set `skills.mode: 'progressive'` to follow the agentskills.io three-tier model instead: the prompt carries only each skill's name + trigger, and the agent calls the **`skill`** tool to load a skill's full body on demand.

Discovery and context ordering are deterministic: layers are traversed by priority and entries inside each layer are sorted by skill name. The environment block always receives every discovered name and trigger. In eager mode, bodies are added in that same stable order until `eagerMaxChars`; overflow remains in the manifest. In progressive mode, the manifest is the context contract and the `skill` tool is the deterministic body/resource loading path.

The `skill` tool also handles **bundled resources** (tier 3) — scripts, references, assets, any subdirectory:

- `skill({ name: "docker-deploy" })` → the SKILL.md body + a recursive listing of every bundled file.
- `skill({ name: "docker-deploy", resource: "references/COMPOSE.md" })` → that file's content.
- Scripts come back with an absolute path; the agent runs them via `bash`.

Use the `skill` tool (not `read`) for skill resources: it works for foreign skills that live outside the project root (`~/.claude/skills/…`, `~/.cursor/skills-cursor/…`), which a project-root-restricted `read` tool may refuse.

```jsonc
// ~/.wrongstack/profiles/<name>/config.json
{ "skills": { "mode": "progressive" } }
```

## Importing skills (`/skill-import`)

Foreign skills are usable as-is, but to **own, edit, or commit** one, import it into `.wrongstack/skills/`:

```
/skill-import --from cursor             # copy project .cursor/skills-cursor → .wrongstack/skills
/skill-import --from codex --global     # copy ~/.codex/skills
/skill-import --from claude             # copy project .claude/skills (--from-claude alias)
/skill-import /abs/path/to/skills       # copy from any directory
/skill-import --from trae --link        # symlink instead of copy (falls back to copy on Windows w/o Dev Mode)
```

`--from <tool>` resolves each agent's skill dir automatically (cursor's `skills-cursor` included). Known tools: `claude`, `agents`, `codex`, `gemini`, `cursor`, `qwen`, `trae`, `windsurf`.

## Roster roles vs. skills

A skill is a passive Markdown file. A **roster role** is a TypeScript subagent definition. They reach the agent through completely different paths, which is why some names you'll see in the CLI — most notably `shadow-agent` — never appear in the bundled-skills table above.

| | Skill | Roster role |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter | TypeScript `SubagentConfig` object |
| Where it lives | `packages/core/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (or `~/.wrongstack/profiles/<name>/skills/`, `<project>/.wrongstack/skills/`) | `packages/core/src/coordination/fleet.ts` (or related agent modules) |
| How it reaches the agent | Injected into the system prompt via `DefaultSkillLoader` when `DefaultSystemPromptBuilder` builds the prompt | Spawned via `spawn_subagent { role: '<id>' }` and runs in its own context/budget |
| Who maintains it | Humans (with AI assistance via `/skill-gen`) | WrongStack core team — compiled into the binary |
| Listed in `/skill` | Yes | No |
| Listed in `fleet (action: status)` | No | Yes |

### Example: `shadow-agent`

`shadow-agent` is a roster role, not a skill. Its definition lives at `packages/core/src/coordination/agents/shadow-agent-role.ts` as `export const SHADOW_AGENT: SubagentConfig = { id: 'shadow-agent', role: 'shadow-agent', ... }`. The roster catalog in `packages/core/src/coordination/fleet.ts` registers it under the key `'shadow-agent'`. You start it with:

```
spawn_subagent { role: 'shadow-agent', task: '...', maxIterations: 12 }
```

If you have ever seen a file at `<project>/.wrongstack/skills/shadow-agent/SKILL.md`, that is a **runtime side-effect** — the shadow agent writes its own SKILL.md to disk while it runs so its prompt survives session restarts. It is not how the role is *defined*; it is how the role is *persisted*. The actual source of truth is the `SHADOW_AGENT` constant in `agents/shadow-agent-role.ts`.

Other roster roles follow the same pattern (see `packages/core/src/coordination/agents/`). If you're looking for "how do I make the agent smarter about X", you almost always want to write a skill. If you're looking for "how do I spawn a specialized subagent that runs X", you want a roster role.

## Writing effective skills

### Description quality

The `description` field is the trigger. The agent reads it to decide whether the skill is relevant to the current task. Make it:

- **Specific**: "Use this skill when writing or reviewing React 19+ code" ✅
- **Not too broad**: "General programming help" ❌
- **Action-oriented**: "Use when proposing, creating, or reviewing git commits" ✅
- **Scope-limited**: Include what the skill does NOT cover if there's ambiguity

### Body structure

```markdown
---
name: example
description: |
  Use this skill when doing X. Covers Y and Z.
version: 1.0.0
---

# Title

One-line summary of the skill's purpose.

## Section 1 — Domain rules

- Rule 1
- Rule 2
- Rule 3

## Section 2 — Patterns

| Pattern | When to use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| A | When X | `code example` |
| B | When Y | `code example` |

## Anti-patterns

- Don't do X because Y.
- Avoid Z — it causes W.
```

### Token budget

The system prompt has a finite context window. Skills that are too long will be truncated or will crowd out other important context. Guidelines:

- **Target**: 200–800 tokens per skill
- **Hard limit**: ~2000 tokens (the loader doesn't enforce this, but the compactor will trim)
- **Tip**: Use tables and bullet points over prose. Code examples should be minimal — show the pattern, not the full implementation.

### Common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it's bad | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Too broad description | Activates on irrelevant tasks, wastes context | Narrow the trigger to specific scenarios |
| No examples | Agent can't infer the pattern from rules alone | Add at least one concrete code example |
| Too long | Crowds out other skills and user messages | Split into multiple focused skills |
| Duplicate name | Shadows the other skill silently | Use unique, descriptive names |
| No anti-patterns | Agent may apply the skill incorrectly | List what NOT to do |

## Viewing discovered skills

```bash
# CLI subcommand
wrongstack skills

# Slash command (in REPL/TUI)
/skill
```

Both show the skill name, source layer (project / user / bundled), and description.

---

## Example: Project-specific skill

```markdown
---
name: acme-conventions
description: |
  Use this skill when writing or modifying code in the acme-web repository.
  Covers naming conventions, test patterns, and deployment rules specific to Acme.
version: 1.0.0
---

# Acme Web Conventions

## Naming

- Components: PascalCase (`UserProfile.tsx`)
- Hooks: `use` prefix (`useUserData.ts`)
- Utilities: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE (`MAX_RETRIES`)

## Testing

- Unit tests co-located: `foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Use `vi.mock()` for external deps, never for internal modules
- Run `pnpm test` before every commit

## Deployment

- `main` = production, `develop` = staging
- Never push directly to `main` — use PRs
- CI runs lint + typecheck + test on every PR
```

Save as `<project>/.wrongstack/skills/acme-conventions/SKILL.md` and commit it.

## Installing, searching, and authoring skills

WrongStack ships a toolkit of slash commands (the first-party `wstack-skills`
plugin) for discovering, installing, and creating skills:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/skill` | List available skills or show one skill's body. |
| `/skill-search <query>` | Search the skill registry (skills.sh) for installable skills. |
| `/skill-install <ref>` | Install from `<user/repo[@ref]>`, `skills.sh:<owner/repo>`, or any registry id. |
| `/skill-import [--from <tool>]` | Take ownership of a foreign agent's skill (copy/symlink into `.wrongstack/skills`). |
| `/skill-update [name]` | Re-fetch installed skills from their source. |
| `/skill-uninstall <name>` | Remove an installed skill. |
| `/skill-gen` | Authoring toolkit — see below. |

### Searching the registry

`/skill-search` queries **skills.sh** (the open agent-skills marketplace backed
by [mastra-ai/skills-api](https://github.com/mastra-ai/skills-api), 34k+ skills
across 2.8k+ repos). Each hit shows a security score (0–100): hits below 30 are
flagged with ⚠ and warrant a review before installing.

```
/skill-search react
```

To point at a self-hosted skills-api instance, set `config.skills.registryUrl`
in the active profile config. This field is **stripped from repo-committed
config** (`<project>/.wrongstack/config.json`) because the parsed registry
response flows into the prompt — a repo-controlled URL would be an
SSRF / prompt-injection vector.

### Installing

```
/skill-install octocat/react-pro              # GitHub, default branch
/skill-install octocat/react-pro@v2.0.0       # GitHub, specific ref
/skill-install skills.sh:octocat/react-pro    # registry-resolved
/skill-install octocat/react-pro --global     # → ~/.wrongstack/profiles/<name>/skills/
```

**Private repos:** set `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or `GH_TOKEN`) in your environment. The
token is sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to the GitHub API; without it
only public repos work and the anonymous 60/hour rate limit applies.

Supports both single-skill repos (`SKILL.md` at root) and multi-skill repos
(`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`).

### Authoring with `/skill-gen`

`/skill-gen` is a toolkit with sub-commands for the mechanical parts of skill
creation (validation, scaffolding) plus an AI-guided wizard for the open-ended
parts:

| Sub-command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/skill-gen` (bare) | AI-guided wizard — you answer questions, the agent writes the file. |
| `/skill-gen skeleton <name> --desc "..." --trigger a,b` | Generate a valid SKILL.md skeleton to edit. |
| `/skill-gen from-prompt "<text>"` | Turn a prompt into a skill draft. |
| `/skill-gen validate <name>` | Validate a name (kebab-case format + collisions) before writing. |
| `/skill-gen view <name>` | Show a skill's body (read-only). |
| `/skill-gen edit <name>` | Open a skill in `$EDITOR` / `$VISUAL`. |
| `/skill-gen list` | List skills with their source layer. |

The bundled `skill-creator` skill (loaded into the prompt) is the wizard's
brain — it holds the authoring rules and workflow. Always run
`/skill-gen validate <name>` after writing a new skill to confirm it loads.
