# Contributing to WrongStack

Thank you for your interest in contributing to WrongStack! This guide covers the essentials for getting set up and submitting changes.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 22.19.0
- **pnpm** ≥ 12.3.4 — `corepack enable` is enough; the repo's `packageManager` field pins the exact version
- **Git**
- **Python 3** (only if you work on the security-scanner skills)

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WrongStack/WrongStack.git
cd WrongStack
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

The `postinstall` script configures git hooks (`.githooks/pre-commit`) automatically.

## Development Workflow

### Building

```bash
pnpm build                    # Build all packages
pnpm --filter @wrongstack/core build   # Build a single package
```

### Testing

```bash
pnpm test                     # Run vitest + webui tests
pnpm test:affected            # Run only what your changes can have broken
pnpm test:watch               # Watch mode
pnpm test:coverage            # Coverage report
pnpm test:e2e                 # Playwright E2E suite
node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run packages/telegram/  # Tests for one package
```

#### `pnpm test:affected`

A full root run is ~13 minutes and 39,827 tests, and while you iterate almost
all of it re-proves what it proved an hour ago. A test can only start failing if
code it reaches changed, so `test:affected` skips the files whose entire import
closure is byte-identical and which passed last time. On an untouched tree it
answers in about two seconds; after editing one source file it typically runs a
handful of suites in ten.

The first run has no cache and does the full suite to build one. After that:

```bash
pnpm test:affected --list     # show the plan, run nothing
pnpm test:affected --all      # force a full run and re-seed the cache
pnpm test:affected -- -t foo  # anything after -- goes to vitest
```

It decides only what is safe to SKIP, never what to run — Vitest still
enumerates the suite through its own `include` globs, so a file the cache has
never seen runs by default. Everything else errs the same way: a new file, a
file that did not pass, a changed or deleted dependency, or any edit to
`vitest.config.ts`, the setup files, `package.json` or the lockfile all put a
test back in the run.

Do not treat it as a gate. It follows *import* edges, so a test that reads a
fixture at runtime without importing it will not notice that fixture changing.
CI and `pnpm release:check` always run everything; this is for the loop in
between. `vitest --changed` and `vitest --related` are not usable here — both
were measured against this repo and selected *zero* test files for an edit to
`packages/core/src/types/session.ts`.

### Linting & Formatting

```bash
pnpm lint                     # Lint with Biome
pnpm exec biome check --write .  # Auto-fix lint issues
pnpm format                   # Format with Biome
pnpm typecheck                # TypeScript type-check all packages
```

### Benchmarks

```bash
pnpm bench                    # Run vitest bench
pnpm bench:perf               # Run performance benchmarks
```

## Pre-Commit Hooks

The `.githooks/pre-commit` hook runs:

1. **`guard-against-corruption`** — blocks known corruption patterns and suspicious mass-changes
2. **`lint-console-logging`** — enforces structured logging instead of raw `console.*`
3. **`guard-unresolved-imports`** — blocks commits that import modules not staged/tracked

These are advisory-only without `set -e`. The hook enables it. **Do not bypass with `--no-verify`** unless you understand the guards.

### Local CI (`pnpm ci:local`)

There is no pre-push hook: `git push` is not gated. Run `pnpm ci:local` yourself before pushing — it is the laptop equivalent of [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml): lint, build, typecheck, Vitest + WebUI tests, HQ dashboard / TUI status-bar suites, and the snapshot/architecture gates.

Coverage ratchets (~45 min) and Playwright e2e stay in GitHub CI. The full maintainer matrix remains available as `pnpm release:check`.

```bash
pnpm ci:local          # laptop subset of GitHub CI
pnpm release:check     # full matrix, including coverage
```

## Code Style

WrongStack uses **Biome** for formatting and linting, with strict TypeScript (`strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noImplicitReturns`, etc.).

Key conventions:

- **ESM only** — `"type": "module"` in all packages. Use `import`/`export`, not `require`.
- **File extensions in imports** — use `.js` in relative imports (NodeNext resolution).
- **No `console.*` in production code** — use the structured logger instead.
- **Strict null checks** — never use `!` non-null assertions without a preceding guard.
- **`as never` is a red flag** — only acceptable in test code where you deliberately bypass types.

## Performance Contract

These rules apply to every performance-motivated change in this repository —
human or agent. They exist because the two ways performance work goes wrong
(claiming a win that was never measured, and keeping a change that bought
nothing) are both invisible without a standing rule against them.

1. **No performance claim without a number.** If you say something is faster,
   show the before/after measurement and the exact command that produced it.
2. **Baseline before you touch anything.** Record workload, command, metric,
   value, commit hash, machine, and runtime version in `PERF_LOG.md` before
   changing code for performance reasons.
3. **One variable at a time, then re-measure.** If the delta is inside noise —
   below the spread of 3 repeat runs, or under 5% — revert the change.
4. **Correctness gates everything.** The test suite passes before and after,
   with identical observable behaviour. A faster wrong answer is a regression.
5. **Prefer, in this order:** (a) do less work — algorithm, complexity, caching;
   (b) do work fewer times — batching, deduplication; (c) do work later or never
   — laziness, short-circuits, streaming; (d) do the same work faster —
   micro-optimisation. Never start at (d).
6. **Do not trade readability for less than a 10% win** on a path that is not hot.
7. **Report regressions honestly**, including ones you introduced yourself.
8. **Distinguish explicitly** between what you measured, what you read in the
   code, and what you are inferring. Label the last one SPECULATIVE.

The tooling that enforces this:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/perf` | One measure-change-measure round (also `audit`, `triage`, `memory`, `io`, `cpu`, `guard`) |
| `/perf log` | Print the `PERF_LOG.md` ledger — deterministic, no model call |
| `pnpm perf:guard` | Re-measure the probes in `architecture/perf-baseline.json` and gate on regressions |
| `pnpm perf:guard:write` | …and ratchet the baseline down for improvements |

Rule 3 is not advisory: `decide()` in `@wrongstack/core/performance` requires a
delta to clear **both** the run-to-run spread and the 5% floor before a change
counts as an improvement. Full design in [`docs/performance-ratchet.md`](docs/performance-ratchet.md).

## Monorepo Layout

```
packages/    — 20 publishable packages (core, cli, tools, providers, etc.)
apps/        — wrongstack (binary shim), desktop (Electron)
website/     — Marketing/docs site
e2e/         — Playwright E2E tests
docs/        — Architecture docs, ADRs, plans, slash-command reference
scripts/     — Build, lint, and guard scripts
```

Each package has its own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/`, and `tests/`.

## Submitting Changes

### 1. Create a branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature
```

### 2. Make your changes

- Keep commits focused — one logical change per commit.
- Run `pnpm ci:local` before pushing — pushes are not gated by any hook. Fix failures locally instead of pushing a red tree.
- Write tests for new functionality.

### 3. Commit message convention

We follow **Conventional Commits**:

```
feat(tools): add glob support to read tool
fix(cli): correct fallback chain for review agents
docs(core): document BootConfig options
refactor(webui): extract AudienceMemoryPanel scope logic
test(telegram): add cursor persistence integration test
chore(deps): bump undici to 7.28.0
```

### 4. Push and open a PR

```bash
git push origin feat/your-feature
```

Open a pull request against `main`. CI runs lint → typecheck → build → test automatically.

---

## CI Pipeline

The [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on every push and PR to `main`:

| Job | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Lint** | Biome lint check |
| **Typecheck** | `tsc --noEmit` across all project references |
| **Build** | `pnpm build` — esbuild all packages |
| **Test** | `pnpm test` — vitest + webui tests |

All jobs must pass before merge.

## Adding a New Package

1. Create `packages/<name>/` with `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/`, `tests/`.
2. Add to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (covered by `packages/*` glob).
3. Add a project reference in root `tsconfig.json`.
4. Create a `vitest.config.ts` if the package needs test-specific config.
5. Run `pnpm install` to link.

---

## Release Process

Releases are manual (no automated publishing yet):

```bash
pnpm release:check    # Full gate: audit + build + contracts + lint + typecheck + test
pnpm release          # release:check + portable build + ordered publish
pnpm release:plan     # print the dependency-layer publish order (publishes nothing)
pnpm release:verify   # confirm every working-tree version is live on npm
```

Versioning uses `pnpm version:patch` (or `version:minor` / `version:major`) and conventional-commit-based semver bumps.

### Why the publish is ordered

`pnpm publish -r` sorts topologically but publishes concurrently, so the
registry can observe a package before its dependencies. That shipped a real
outage in 0.317.2: `wrongstack` landed on npm 25 seconds ahead of its
transitive dependency `@wrongstack/webui-hq`, and every `npm i -g wrongstack`
in that window failed with `ETARGET`. `scripts/publish-workspace.mjs` publishes
in dependency layers and polls the registry until each layer is actually
resolvable before starting the next, so the install target is always last.
