WrongStack is **free, open source, and MIT licensed**. It drives autonomous goal
loops, parallel subagent fan-out, and Brain-governed policy decisions — with a
**project-wide SAGE memory** that persists knowledge across sessions, **active
Kanban boards** with atomic verification, an **inter-agent mailbox** that links
every client, and **Chimera** auto-review agents that critique your diffs.
It ships with a deep built-in toolbox, bundled skills, managed first-party
plugins, and a provider catalog pulled live from
[models.dev](https://models.dev) — all on top of a compact, swappable kernel.

**Built from scratch, stands on its own.** WrongStack is not a plugin layer or an
orchestration kit bolted onto another coding tool — it's a complete agent written
top to bottom: its own compact kernel, its own provider transports with real SSE,
its own tool executor, permission policy, memory system, and multi-agent runtime.
Nothing here wraps a third-party CLI; everything works standalone.

### The scale of it

Not a thin wrapper — a real engine. The codebase is first-party,
TypeScript-strict source across a full monorepo, guarded by an extensive test
suite. Memory, tools, providers, permissions, and the multi-agent runtime are all
first-party and work together, on your machine, with no upstream agent to phone
home to.

### What's new in 1.0.9

- **Delegation no longer freezes the leader.** `delegate` returns as soon as a
  background worker starts, delivers its result at the leader's next iteration
  boundary, and can auto-wake an idle interactive leader. Use `wait: true` when
  the result must gate the next step.
- **Releases are quicker to iterate on and safer to install.** `pnpm
  release:fast` skips only the audit and instrumented-coverage gates CI covers,
  while the release matrix now verifies that the packed providers package
  installs with npm 10.
- **Long-running sessions recover more cleanly.** ACP cancellation covers
  session startup as well as an active prompt; clearing history leaves the
  writer usable; active sessions cannot be renamed underneath their writer.
- **TUI and WebUI state stays bounded.** Picker lists use their actual terminal
  height, and turn undo removes the execution records belonging to discarded
  messages.
- **Provider compatibility is restored for npm users.** Cloudflare gateway
  routing uses the compatible AI SDK 7 providers, avoiding npm's peer-dependency
  replacement loop.

## Why WrongStack

- 🧠 **It remembers your project.** **SAGE** keeps long-term memory in
  SQLite/FTS5, anchored to real files, symbols, commands, and commits — and
  re-verified as they change. Decisions, conventions, and root causes survive the
  session that produced them.
- 🤖 **A fleet, not a lone agent.** A full specialist roster and smart dispatcher
  fan out under a Director, each subagent isolated with its own budget and JSONL
  transcript.
- 📈 **The roster gets better here.** Each role turns useful outcomes into
  skill-specific practice, ranks what actually works in *this* repo, and applies
  it on the next matching task.
- 🛠️ **A deep toolbox, no plugins required.** Edits, lint/format/typecheck/test,
  execution, git, web, browser/E2E, and a SQLite codebase index with symbol and
  call-graph navigation.
- 🖥️ **Six surfaces, one brain.** A plain readline REPL, an Ink/React **TUI**
  (`--tui`), the full **WebUI** (`--webui`), lightweight **SimpleUI**,
  **Desktop** (`--desktop`), and the cross-machine **HQ** (`--hq`) — same engine,
  same session, same memory underneath.
- 🛰️ **HQ for the whole room.** Aggregate live sessions, agents, fleets, mailbox
  state, cost, tools, Brain decisions, and worktrees across machines — then
  steer, note, queue, or stop connected clients through their own guardrails.
- 📬 **Agents that coordinate instead of collide.** One project-wide mailbox
  links every client, session, branch, and linked worktree, with typed messages
  and live presence.
- ♾️ **Set a goal, walk away.** `/goal` locks a contract and the eternal /
  parallel engines grind until it is *verifiably* done — with the **Brain**
  deciding risky calls by policy, denying them, or escalating to a human.
- 🗂️ **Work tracking that resists lying.** Durable Kanban boards and typed tasks
  with dependencies, lifecycle stages, and **atomic verification** gates that let
  a card reach Done only when its criteria actually pass.
- 🦂 **Your diffs get reviewed.** **Chimera** critiques changed files with
  severity-ranked `file:line` findings and a one-line fix each, and fixer agents
  can follow up.
- 🔌 **Providers without lock-in.** Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and a broad range
  of OpenAI-compatible endpoints, refreshed from models.dev at boot.
- 🏠 **Local & custom endpoints.** One-command presets for **Ollama / vLLM / LM
  Studio**, plus any custom `baseUrl` or **OmniRoute**-style gateway; run fully
  on localhost.
- 🔑 **Sign in with a subscription.** Authenticate with a **ChatGPT (Codex)**,
  **Claude Pro/Max** (for extra usage credits), or **GitHub Copilot** account
  over OAuth, *alongside* API keys.
- 🔀 **Per-role model routing.** Assign different providers/models per role or
  phase, with automatic **fallback chains** when a model is overloaded.
- 🔐 **Locked down where it counts.** Encrypted secrets and a permission policy
  on every tool call, both always on. Project-root containment is opt-in
  (`/settings` → Filesystem access); once you enable it, neither YOLO nor a
  repo-committed config can turn it back off.
- 🪶 **A kernel you can actually read.** `Container · Pipeline · EventBus ·
  RunController` — small enough to read in one sitting. Everything above it is
  swappable.

---

## How WrongStack compares

Most "AI coding" tools fall into one of two buckets: a **single-agent CLI** that
edits files in one terminal, or an **orchestration kit** that shells out to a
third-party agent CLI and coordinates it. WrongStack is neither — it's a complete
agent written from scratch, so the whole stack is first-party and consistent.

| | Wrapper / orchestration-only tools | **WrongStack** |
|---|---|---|
| **Core** | Coordinates an external agent CLI (Claude Code, etc.) | **Own compact kernel** — `Container · Pipeline · EventBus · RunController` |
| **Providers** | Inherits whatever the wrapped tool supports | **Own transports** — multiple wire families + real SSE, catalog from models.dev |
| **Tools** | Whatever the underlying CLI exposes | **First-party built-in tools** — edit, exec, search, browser/E2E, SQLite codebase index |
| **Local-only** | Needs the upstream tool + network | **Runs entirely on localhost** — one-command Ollama / vLLM / LM Studio presets; tools, memory, and fleet stay on your machine |
| **Memory** | Usually none, or bolted-on files | **SAGE** — SQLite/FTS5, code-anchored, auto-injected long-term memory |
| **Multi-agent** | Orchestrates external processes | **Native fleet + Director** — specialist roster, isolated budgets, one mailbox |
| **Surfaces** | One (a terminal) | **Six** — REPL, TUI, WebUI, SimpleUI, Desktop, HQ |
| **Review** | Manual | **Chimera** auto-review + fixer agents on your diffs |
| **Permissions** | Depends on the wrapped tool | **Per-tool policy on every call**, project-root containment YOLO can't override |

The point isn't "more features" — it's that a from-scratch, standalone design lets
memory, tools, providers, permissions, and the multi-agent runtime actually work
*together* instead of being glued across process boundaries.

---

## Requirements

- **npm/pnpm install:** Node.js ≥ 22.19.0 and pnpm ≥ 12.3.4 (recommended) or npm
- **Bun runtime:** Bun ≥ 1.3.10

---

## Install

```bash
npm i -g wrongstack
# or
pnpm add -g wrongstack
```

This pulls the full stack. The TUI ships but is lazy-loaded behind `--tui`, so
plain-REPL users pay no React/Ink cost at startup. The browser UI, HQ, and
Desktop shell are available through their launch flags (see [Surfaces](#surfaces)).

Then just run:

```bash
wrongstack        # or the short alias: wstack
```

From a source checkout, the same built CLI can run directly on Bun:

```bash
pnpm build
bun run start:bun
```

`pnpm smoke:bun` verifies Bun's SQLite-backed SAGE path, heap watchdog,
WebUI server module graph, and CLI entry point. Node continues to use
`node:sqlite`; Bun selects `bun:sqlite` automatically.

To run HQ as a boot-persistent, auto-restarting systemd service with password
authentication and an optional IP/CIDR admission list, see
[HQ service](docs/hq-service.md).

---

## Staying current

Update the CLI in place from inside the tool:

```bash
wstack update                 # update via your detected package manager
wstack update --check-only    # is a newer release available?
wstack update --pm pnpm       # force a specific package manager
```

Or update manually:

```bash
npm i -g wrongstack@latest
# or
pnpm add -g wrongstack@latest
```

Lifecycle scripts are skipped by default; pass `--allow-scripts` to opt in.
Full flag reference: [CLI reference → Updating](docs/cli-reference.md#updating).

---

## Quick start

```bash
# First run — interactive auth/setup, then a launch menu on a TTY
wstack

# Sign in with a ChatGPT/Codex or Claude subscription
wstack auth

# Skip the picker and pin a provider/model
wstack --provider anthropic --model claude-sonnet-4

# TUI with an explicit YOLO override
wstack --tui --yolo

# Director fleet orchestration
wstack --director

# Single-shot query (non-interactive)
wstack -p "explain packages/core/src/kernel"

# Resume a saved session
wstack --resume
```

First run walks you through authentication and model selection. No config? The
interactive provider/model picker launches automatically. Switch providers any
time at runtime with `/model`.

Full flag and subcommand reference: [`docs/cli-reference.md`](docs/cli-reference.md).

## Surfaces

| Surface | Launch | Best for |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **REPL** | `wstack` | Fast, dependency-light terminal use |
| **TUI** | `wstack --tui` | Rich full-screen terminal with panels |
| **WebUI** | `wstack --webui` | Browser chat + tool/diff/session panels |
| **SimpleUI** | `wstack --simpleui` | Fast, focused standalone browser chat (see below) |
| **Desktop** | `wstack --desktop` | Electron shell over a token-gated local WebUI |
| **HQ** | `wstack --hq` | Cross-machine command center for a whole team |

Plain `wstack` on a TTY opens a launch menu; add `--no-menu` to go straight to the
REPL. See [WebUI](docs/webui.md) for the browser surface details.

**SimpleUI** is a full, independent chat surface (Vite + React), not a
stripped WebUI. It reuses the same WebSocket backend but ships its own bundle,
with a sticky composer, `@`-file picker, streaming markdown + syntax highlighting,
vision/image attachments, session switching, and a lazy-loaded Tools/Todo/Task/Plan
sidebar — deliberately minimal, fast, and focused.

---

## Core capabilities

WrongStack is standalone-sufficient — the highlights below work with **no plugins
required**. Deep reference lives in [`docs/reference.md`](docs/reference.md).

### Tools & code intelligence

The built-in toolbox spans filesystem edits, code quality (`lint`/`format`/
`typecheck`/`test`), execution, web search/fetch, git, packages, browser/E2E
controls, and a project-owned Codebase Index. The index combines SQLite/FTS5
substring search, local semantic ranking, content-hash invalidation, symbol and
call-graph navigation, and bounded parser workers for large repositories. Full map:
[reference → tools](docs/reference.md#built-in-tools-67).

Every tool is registered and callable at every setting. How many are *described*
to the model on each request depends on the token-saving tier: the default trims
that to a working set and keeps the rest one `tool_search` away, so a long
session does not pay for every schema on every turn. Set
`features.tokenSavingMode: "off"` to describe them all directly.

### Autonomy & goals

`/goal` locks a verifiable contract and the eternal / parallel engines run until
it's done, surfacing a live stage chip (`⟳ DECIDE` / `⚡ EXECUTE` / `◎ REFLECT`).
The **Brain** governs risky decisions with deterministic rules, decision traces,
quality gates, and circuit breaking.

### Multi-agent fleet + Director

A specialist roster and smart dispatcher fan out under a Director. Each subagent
is isolated with its own budget and JSONL transcript, coordinated over a
project-wide mailbox. See [Director architecture](docs/director-architecture.md)
and [agents](docs/agents.md).

### Self-improving roster agents

Every roster role has a base definition, but each **project can teach it**. Under
`.wrongstack/agents/<role>/`, the role keeps its identity, a structured learning
buffer, and skill-specific practice at `skills/<skill>.md`. A run can end with a
`## LEARNED [skill: testing]` directive (or let WrongStack route it from the
wording); the next matching spawn receives that project practice immediately below
the bundled skill it refines. `/agent-improve <role> capture`, `optimize`, and
`skills` make the loop visible, while automatic optimization distils safely in the
background. Useful skills gain affinity from usage and outcomes, can be pinned,
and rise into the role's bounded eager-load set — so your bug-hunter, reviewer,
and executor improve where it matters without turning every prompt into a dump of
old notes.

### Inter-agent mailbox

One project-wide coordination plane connects **every agent, across every client,
process, session, branch, and linked Git worktree** — CLI, TUI, WebUI, SimpleUI,
Desktop, and HQ alike. Agents send typed messages (`ask`, `assign`, `steer`,
`result`, `review`, `status`), hand off work, broadcast milestones, and see who is
online with live presence — so parallel agents cooperate instead of colliding.
HQ can even route mailbox traffic and steer connected clients through their own
guardrails. All production callers use a deterministic local IPC endpoint; one
elected project owner alone opens `_mailbox.sqlite`, serializes mutations, and
publishes health and presence. Clients never open the mailbox database directly.

### SAGE — persistent long-term memory

**SAGE** is WrongStack's project-local, structured long-term memory. It lives at
`.wrongstack/memories/` backed by **SQLite/FTS5** (legacy JSONL auto-migrates on
first open), and it is *indexed by default*. The agent uses `remember`,
`memory_search`, and `pin_add` to persist and recall knowledge across sessions —
and relevant memories are **auto-injected** into context every turn. The same
project-owned service is available to external MCP clients through
`wstack-sage-mcp`; it is read-only by default, while `--writable` enables the
confirm-class mutation tools.

- **Typed knowledge** — facts, decisions, conventions, preferences, anti-patterns, bug root causes, and file/symbol/command notes, each with importance + confidence.
- **Rich anchors** — a memory can bind to almost anything concrete: a **file**, a **directory**, a **symbol** (function/class/method), a **command**, a **git commit or blob**, a **test**, or a **package**. Anchored memories are re-verified as those targets change (file existence, content hash, git blob, symbol presence) and auto-surface when you touch that location — so knowledge stays pinned to the code it describes instead of drifting.
- **Knowledge graph** — typed edges + BFS traversal relate memories, files, symbols, and commands.
- **Audience-scoped** — memories can target specific roles/modes so role-specific guidance never clutters general recall.
- **Curated, not chaotic** — a review queue and hygiene pipeline keep memory trustworthy; deletions are guarded.

See [`docs/sage/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/sage/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Tasks & Kanban — active work tracking

Work is tracked with real, durable structure — not throwaway checklists:

- **`todo`** — session-level step tracking for the task in flight.
- **`plan`** — a persistent strategic roadmap that survives turns; promote items into todos or tasks.
- **`task`** — structured, cross-session work items with types, priorities, and dependencies.
- **`kanban`** — durable project boards with columns, task **chains**, dependencies, and assignment snapshots. One project IPC owner serializes the authoritative `.wrongstack/kanbans/_kanban.sqlite` state and broadcasts daemon events; clients do not open the database directly. The `@wrongstack/kanban` package provides the storage + lifecycle layer (claim, recover stale assignments, verify completion) with **lease fencing** and cost guardrails for safe multi-agent execution.

Managed cards follow an explicit `Backlog → Todo → Running → Review → Done`
lifecycle, and **HQ** exposes a shared, project-scoped board that reconciles live
across every clone carrying the project identity.

**Atomic verification** keeps tasks honest. Cards carry success criteria, goal
metrics, and checks; the board can **assess atomicity** and either *propose* or
*auto* decompose non-atomic work (`atomicityMode: off | assess | enforce`).
Completion isn't a rubber stamp — `verify_completion` gates a card into Done only
when its acceptance criteria and evidence actually pass, so a worker finishing
means the card enters **Review**, not Done.

### Spec-Driven Development (`/sdd`)

Turn a spec into acceptance criteria, decompose into dependency-linked tasks,
implement one at a time, and validate against the spec before closing.

### Plugin ecosystem

A collection of managed first-party plugins extends the agent with focused,
single-purpose capabilities, each auditable and individually disableable. See
[plugin management](docs/plugin-management.md) and the
[plugin author guide](docs/plugin-author-guide.md).

### Providers & subscription sign-in

Providers span several API-key wire families, plus OAuth sign-in with ChatGPT
(Codex), Claude Pro/Max (for extra usage credits), and GitHub Copilot accounts —
usable alongside API keys. Browse with `wstack models`. See
[OAuth sign-in](docs/oauth-signin.md).

**Bring your own endpoint.** Beyond the catalog, you can point WrongStack at *any*
OpenAI-compatible endpoint: **local models** via one-command presets for
**Ollama** (no key), **vLLM**, and **LM Studio**; **custom providers** with your
own `baseUrl` and env-var keys; and proxy/router gateways like **OmniRoute**. Run
entirely on localhost if you want — the same tools, fleet, and memory work
against a model on your own machine.

### Model routing & fallbacks

Mix providers and models freely, per role and per phase. A **model-routing
matrix** assigns a provider/model — or a named **fallback profile** — to any agent
role, phase, or the fleet-wide default (exact role → phase → `*` → leader). When a
model is overloaded (429/5xx), WrongStack rotates through an ordered **fallback
chain** automatically, and `favoriteModelsOnly` keeps that rotation on models you
trust. So a leader, a reviewer, and a bug-hunter can each run on a different model
in the same session, each with its own safety net.

### HQ — cross-machine command center

`wstack --hq` is the control plane for a whole room. It aggregates **live
sessions, agents, fleets, mailbox state, cost, tools, Brain decisions, and
worktrees across multiple machines and clients** in one dashboard — running many
providers and models simultaneously — and can steer runs, send BTW notes, queue
prompts, route mailbox traffic, or stop connected clients through their own
guardrails. Browser and client tokens are separate and capability-scoped; in
token mode every `/api/*` route and WS upgrade is gated.

### CodeMap & visual views

The WebUI turns the SQLite codebase index into **code intelligence you can see**.
**CodeMap** renders an interactive dependency/symbol graph (server-side cached,
with visible-element virtualization for large graphs) so you can navigate the
project's structure and hotspots at a glance. Alongside it, live **fleet
topology** and an **Office view** visualize your running agents spatially — who is
active, what each is doing, and how the fleet is wired — turning multi-agent runs
into something you can actually watch.

**A file's whole story, traceable.** CodeMap streams live per-file activity —
every read / write / edit / delete / search / index / execute — tagged with the
**session**, **agent**, **tool**, trace id, timestamp, and the actual line
changes (added / removed, before / after). So from the file explorer you can
replay what happened to any file over time: *which task, which session, which
agent, which tool touched it, and what it did* — the full, attributed history of a
change and everything it reached.

### Chimera — automatic code review

**Chimera** is a post-session code guardian. The built-in auto-review plugin
detects every git-tracked file you changed during a session and dispatches a
review subagent that reads the diffs and reports real, severity-ranked findings
(Critical → Low) with `file:line` references and a one-line fix each — surgical
bug-catching, not style nagging. Paired **fixer** agents can act on the findings,
and reviews can fan out in parallel across many changed files. Trigger it
on-demand with `/chimera`.

### WrongTrace guardrails — optional sibling daemon

WrongStack can coordinate with the external **WrongTrace** daemon when it is
running locally (default `http://localhost:3444`) — and silently does nothing
when it is not. Two independent integrations share that origin: the
**observability guardrails** and **provider rerouting**. Every mutating tool
call (`edit`, `write`, `replace`, `patch`, `codebase-ast-replace`) passes a
fail-open lock gate — a file locked by another owner denies the edit with the
owner and TTL in the reason, fragile files get a surgical-edit nudge, and an
offline daemon never blocks anything. The same daemon optionally rewrites
provider base URLs through `/proxy/` when `tools.wrongProxy.enabled` is set.
Full details: [`docs/wrongtrace.md`](docs/wrongtrace.md).

### Security & privacy

Encrypted secrets at rest, a permission policy on every tool call, project-root
containment that YOLO can't weaken, and a typed observability event catalog.
Threat model: [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

### Token-saving mode

`--token-saving-mode` trims the tool surface and prompt to cut cost. The tier
resolves once at boot (`off | auto | minimal | light | medium | aggressive`);
set `features.tokenSavingMode: "off"` to describe every tool on every turn.

---

## Configuration

| Scope | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Environment | env vars | Overrides and secrets injection |
| User config | `~/.wrongstack/config.json` | Providers, defaults, feature toggles |
| Project conventions | `<project>/.wrongstack/AGENTS.md` | Shared, committed repo conventions |
| Project identity | `<project>/.wrongstack/project.json` | Repository-stable `proj_<ULID>` |

`apiKey`-like fields are auto-encrypted on first contact; plaintext keys in older
configs migrate transparently on boot. Full details:
[`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md).

---

## Architecture

```
CLI       → REPL, renderer, slash commands, subcommands
TUI       → Ink frontend (lazy-loaded behind --tui)
WebUI     → Browser UI + WS bridge (standalone or --webui)
Desktop   → Electron shell hosting a token-gated local WebUI
Runtime   → Default host assembly + WrongStackPack extension composition
Kernel    → Container · Pipeline · EventBus · RunController (the 4 primitives)
Provider  → Multiple wire families, factories built from ModelsRegistry, real SSE
Models    → models.dev/api.json fetched + cached + classified
Services  → deterministic local IPC → one owner each → SQLite-backed project state
```

**Four contracts** hold the design together:

1. **Minimal kernel** — the four primitives stay small enough to read end to end.
2. **Zero non-overridable behavior** — services bound through `Container`, pipelines as middleware, all extension points in registries.
3. **Standalone sufficiency** — works with the built-in tools and no plugins.
4. **Layered, not monolithic** — every feature composes over the kernel through registries; nothing above it is load-bearing.

Full walk-through: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).
