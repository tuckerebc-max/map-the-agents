# AGENTS.md

Conventions for AI agents and humans contributing to **Mistral Vibe** — a Python 3.12+ CLI coding assistant managed with `uv`.

Layout: `vibe/core` is the engine (agent loop, tools, LLM backends, config); `vibe/cli` is the Textual TUI; `vibe/acp` bridges to the Agent Client Protocol; `vibe/setup` runs first-run wizards. Tests live in `tests/` with autouse fixtures in `conftest.py` and test doubles in `tests/stubs/`.

## Architecture Decisions

Before architecture-affecting changes, read the matching ADR. If a change fits the current code but conflicts with ADR direction, flag it to the user before implementing. When creating or editing an ADR, follow the `write-vibe-adr` skill.

When creating or editing an ADR, follow the `write-vibe-adr` skill and keep the standard sections.

## Commands

Always go through `uv` — never invoke bare `python` or `pip`.

- `uv run vibe` / `uv run vibe-acp` — the two entry points.
- `uv run pytest` — full suite (parallel via `pytest-xdist`).
- `uv run pyright` — strict type check.
- `uv run ruff check --fix .` and `uv run ruff format .` — run both after every code change and report the files modified.
- `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` — full lint pass. Install once with `uv tool install pre-commit && uv run pre-commit install`.
- Useful uv basics: `uv sync --all-extras`, `uv add <pkg>`, `uv remove <pkg>`.

## Project layout & module conventions

- `__init__.py` exposes the public API via an explicit `__all__`.
- Private modules are prefixed with `_` (e.g. `_settings.py`, `_config.py`).
- Pydantic config models live in `models.py`; shared config defaults live in `_defaults.py`; the effective config schema lives in `vibe_schema.py`.
- Abstract interfaces use the `_port.py` suffix (hexagonal-style ports).
- Tests mirror the source layout: a test lives in the directory mirroring its source module's package. Tests for a `vibe/core` subpackage go under the matching `tests/core/<subpackage>/` (e.g. `vibe/core/utils/retry.py` → `tests/core/utils/test_retry.py`); tests for modules that sit directly in `vibe/core/` (e.g. `loop.py`, `types.py`) stay flat in `tests/core/`. No `__init__.py` is needed in test subdirectories — pytest runs in `--import-mode=importlib`. Test doubles in `tests/stubs/` are named `Fake*`.

## Autoimprovement

- When a change request can be generalized as a rule, prefer adding it to the relevant `.agents/skills/` SKILL.md rather than appending to AGENTS.md. AGENTS.md should stay small and universal; domain-specific conventions belong in skills so they load only when needed. Create a new skill when no existing one fits.
- Suggest updates to the README.md file according to feature changes or additions.
- Keep the builtin Vibe Skill (`vibe/core/skills/builtins/vibe.py`) up-to-date. It documents the CLI's features, such as args, flags, config options and persistence, commands, built-in agents, file discovery logic.
- When adding or changing Vibe config fields, check whether Settings Manager's Vibe Code managed-config UI and Le Chat Web's backend allowlist/schema must be updated. If no update is needed, say so explicitly in the change notes.
