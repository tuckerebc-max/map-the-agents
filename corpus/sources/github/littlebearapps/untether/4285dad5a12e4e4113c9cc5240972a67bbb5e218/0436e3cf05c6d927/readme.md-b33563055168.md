Your AI coding agents need a terminal, but you don't need to sit at one. Untether runs on your machine and connects your agents to a Telegram bot. Send a task from your phone — by voice or text — and watch your agent work in real time. When it needs permission, tap a button. When it's done, read the result. No desk, no SSH, no screen sharing.

## 🐕 Why Untether?

AI coding agents are powerful, but they're chained to a terminal window. Untether breaks that chain:

- **Your machine does the work** — agents run on your computer (or server) as normal. Untether just bridges them to Telegram.
- **Work from anywhere** — walking the dog, at the gym, on the train, at a friend's place. If you have Telegram, you have your agents.
- **Agents run in the background** — start a task from your phone and put it away. The agent keeps working even if you close Telegram, lose signal, or your phone dies. Check the result when you're ready.
- **Any device, any time** — phone, tablet, laptop, or [Telegram Web](https://web.telegram.org). Start a task on your phone at the park, review results on your laptop at home.
- **Talk instead of type** — send a voice note and Untether transcribes it. Hands full? Dictate your next task.
- **Swap projects and agents** — switch between repos, branches, and engines from the same chat. No restarting, no SSH, no context switching.
- **Stay in control remotely** — budgets, cost tracking, and interactive approval buttons mean you can trust your agents to run without hovering over a terminal.

## ⚡ Quick start

```sh
uv tool install untether        # recommended
# or
pipx install untether            # alternative
```

```sh
untether                        # run setup wizard
```

Update: `uv tool upgrade untether` · Uninstall: `uv tool uninstall untether && rm -rf ~/.untether/`

The wizard creates a Telegram bot, picks your workflow, and connects your chat. Then send a message to your bot:

> fix the failing tests in src/auth

That's it. Your agent runs on your machine, streams progress to Telegram, and you can reply to continue the conversation.

The wizard offers three **workflow modes** — pick the one that fits:

| Mode | How it works |
|------|-------------|
| **Assistant** | Ongoing chat — messages auto-resume your session. `/new` to start fresh. |
| **Workspace** | Forum topics — each topic bound to a project/branch with independent sessions. |
| **Handoff** | Reply-to-continue — resume lines shown for copying to terminal. |

[Choose a mode →](https://untether.littlebearapps.com/how-to/choose-a-mode/) · [Conversation modes tutorial →](https://untether.littlebearapps.com/tutorials/conversation-modes/)

**Tip:** Already have a bot token? Pass it directly: `untether --bot-token YOUR_TOKEN`

📖 See our [help guides](#-help-guides) for detailed setup, engine configuration, and troubleshooting.

## 🎯 Features

- 📡 **Progress streaming** — watch your agent work in real time; see tool calls, file changes, and elapsed time as they happen
- 🔐 **Interactive permissions** — approve plan transitions and answer clarifying questions with inline option buttons; tools auto-execute, and "Pause & Outline Plan" holds the session open while you review the plan outline before approving
- 📋 **Plan mode** — toggle per chat with `/planmode`; choose full manual approval, auto-approved transitions, or no plan phase
- 📁 **Projects and worktrees** — register repos with `untether init`, target with `/myproject @feat/thing`, run branches in isolated worktrees in parallel
- 💰 **Cost and usage tracking** — run agents remotely with confidence; per-run and daily budgets, `/usage` breakdowns, and optional auto-cancel keep spending visible
- 💡 **Actionable error hints** — friendly messages for API outages, rate limits, billing errors, and network failures with resume guidance
- 🏷 **Model and mode metadata** — every completed message shows model with version, effort level, and permission mode (e.g. `🏷 opus 4.6 · medium · plan`) across all engines
- 🎙️ **Voice notes** — hands full? Dictate tasks instead of typing; Untether transcribes via a configurable Whisper-compatible endpoint
- 🔄 **Cross-environment resume** — start a session in your terminal, pick it up from Telegram with `/continue`; works with Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, and Gemini ([guide](docs/how-to/cross-environment-resume.md))
- 📎 **File transfer** — upload files to your repo with `/file put`, download with `/file get`; agents can also deliver files automatically by writing to `.untether-outbox/` during a run — sent as Telegram documents on completion, with whole directories optionally bundled as a zip (`outbox_deliver_directories = "zip"`)
- 🛡️ **Graceful recovery** — orphan progress messages cleaned up on restart; stall detection with CPU-aware diagnostics; auto-continue for Claude Code sessions that exit prematurely
- ⏰ **Scheduled tasks** — cron expressions with timezone support, webhook triggers, one-shot delays (`/at 30m <prompt>`), `run_once` crons, master pause/resume toggle, and hot-reload configuration (no restart required). `/ping` shows per-chat trigger summary; trigger-initiated runs show provenance in the footer (`⏰ cron:<id>` / `⚡ webhook:<id>` / `⏰ at:<token>`); `/stats` reports per-engine triggered-vs-manual breakdown
- 🔁 **Autonomous loops (Claude only)** — opt-in observation of Claude Code's `/loop` and `ScheduleWakeup`; Untether re-fires iterations after the subprocess exits so loops keep running between turns. Off by default; enable per chat via `/config → 🔁 Loop mode`. Cost guarded by `[cost_budget]`, runaway-safety capped by `[loop]` (max iterations, total duration, expiry)
- 💬 **Forum topics** — map Telegram topics to projects and branches
- 📤 **Session export** — `/export` for markdown or JSON transcripts
- 🗂️ **File browser** — `/browse` to navigate project files with inline buttons
- ⚙️ **Inline settings** — `/config` opens an in-place settings menu; toggle plan mode, ask mode, approval policy (Codex), approval mode (Gemini), verbose, engine, model, reasoning, and listen mode with buttons; dedicated `📡 Triggers` page lists per-chat crons/webhooks with last-fired times and a master pause/resume toggle
- 🔄 **Hot-reload configuration** — edit `untether.toml` and changes apply in ~1 second; covers triggers, voice transcription, allowed-user lists, watchdog timing, progress verbosity, file-transfer/outbox config, and per-engine overrides. Only `bot_token`, `chat_id`, `session_mode`, `topics`, and `message_overflow` require a restart. Extend the engine-subprocess env allowlist via `[security] env_extra_allow` / `env_extra_prefix_allow` to thread credential-manager tokens (1Password, Doppler, Vault, …) without forking
- 🧩 **Plugin system** — extend with custom engines, transports, and commands
- 🔌 **Plugin-compatible** — Claude Code plugins detect Untether sessions via `UNTETHER_SESSION` env var, preventing hooks from interfering with Telegram output; works with [PitchDocs](https://github.com/littlebearapps/lba-plugins) and other Claude Code plugins
- 📊 **Session statistics** — `/stats` shows per-engine run counts, action totals, and duration across today, this week, and all time
- 💬 **Three workflow modes** — **assistant** (ongoing chat with auto-resume), **workspace** (forum topics bound to projects/branches), or **handoff** (reply-to-continue with terminal resume lines); [choose a mode](https://untether.littlebearapps.com/how-to/choose-a-mode/) to match your workflow

¹ Amp model override maps to `--mode` (deep/free/rush/smart).
² Defaults to full access (`--approval-mode=yolo`, all tools auto-approved); toggle via `/config` to edit files (`auto_edit`, files OK but no shell) or read-only; pre-run policy, not interactive mid-run approval.
³ Token usage counts only — no USD cost reporting.
⁴ Toggle via `/config` between full auto (default) and safe (`--ask-for-approval=untrusted`, untrusted tools blocked); pre-run policy, not interactive mid-run approval.
⁵ Pi requires `provider = "openai-codex"` in engine config for OAuth subscriptions in headless mode.
⁶ AMP requires an explicit thread ID; no "most recent" mode.

Claude effort levels: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` (`xhigh` requires Claude Code v2.1.114+).

## ⚙️ Configuration

Untether reads `~/.untether/untether.toml`. The setup wizard creates this for you, or configure manually:

```toml
default_engine = "codex"

[transports.telegram]
bot_token = "123456789:ABC..."
chat_id = 123456789
session_mode = "chat"

[projects.myapp]
path = "~/dev/myapp"
default_engine = "claude"

[cost_budget]
enabled = true
max_cost_per_run = 2.00
max_cost_per_day = 10.00
```

See the [full configuration reference](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/blob/master/docs/reference/config.md) for all options.

**Warning:** Never commit your `untether.toml` — it contains your bot token. The default location (`~/.untether/`) keeps it outside your repos.

---

## 🔄 Upgrading

```sh
uv tool upgrade untether        # if installed with uv
# or
pipx upgrade untether            # if installed with pipx
```

Then restart to apply:

```sh
/restart                         # from Telegram (preferred — drains active runs first)
```

Or from your terminal:

```sh
untether                         # start (or restart — Ctrl+C first if already running)
```

> **Note:** If you've set up a systemd service on Linux, use `systemctl --user restart untether` instead.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- **Python 3.12+** — `uv python install 3.14`
- **uv** — `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- At least one agent CLI on PATH: `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `pi`, `gemini`, or `amp`

## 🔒 What Untether accesses

Untether runs on your machine and bridges your agents to Telegram. Here's exactly what it touches:

| Category | What | Details |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Network** | Telegram Bot API (`api.telegram.org`) | Core transport — always active during operation |
| **Network** | Whisper-compatible endpoint | Voice transcription — **disabled by default**, opt-in via config |
| **Network** | Agent APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) | Called by agent subprocesses, not by Untether directly |
| **Filesystem** | `~/.untether/untether.toml` | Config file containing bot token — protect with `chmod 600` |
| **Filesystem** | `~/.untether/*.json` | Chat preferences, session state, usage stats |
| **Filesystem** | `.untether-outbox/` | Agent-delivered files (optional, per-project) |
| **Filesystem** | `/file put` upload paths | User-initiated file uploads from Telegram, written to configured destinations (default: project working dir) |
| **Filesystem** | Webhook `file_write` action | When configured, webhooks can write POST bodies to disk at admin-defined paths (deny-globs apply) |
| **Network** | Webhook `http_forward` action | When configured, webhooks can forward payloads to admin-defined URLs (SSRF-protected) |
| **Processes** | Agent CLIs (claude, codex, etc.) | Spawned as subprocesses with your user permissions; agents have full filesystem access in their working directory |
| **Credentials** | Telegram bot token | Stored in config file (plaintext TOML) |
| **Credentials** | API keys | Read from environment variables, never stored by Untether |

**What Untether does NOT do:** no telemetry, no analytics, no phone-home, no auto-updates, no root access. Sensitive tokens (bot token, OpenAI keys, GitHub tokens) are automatically [redacted from logs](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/blob/master/docs/how-to/security.md).

**What Untether *can* do at your direction:** spawned agents, `/file put`, the outbox, and webhook actions can all touch paths outside `~/.untether/` — that's the whole point. Use [`allowed_user_ids`](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/blob/master/docs/how-to/security.md), file deny-globs, and webhook auth to control who can trigger these flows.
