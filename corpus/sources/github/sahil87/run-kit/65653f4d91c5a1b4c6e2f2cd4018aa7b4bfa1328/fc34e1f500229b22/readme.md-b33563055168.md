**Your tmux, in the browser and on your phone.** HexoKit is a remote console for the machine you actually work on — every tmux session and pane as a live terminal, in a sidebar, from your desk or your couch. It's the modern, terminal-native answer to the old server web-console: nothing to configure, no database, state read straight from tmux.

What makes it so good right now is what tends to run in those panes: **AI coding agents, many at once.** `rk riff` spawns each one in its own [git worktree](https://github.com/sahil87/wt), and the dashboard lets you watch the whole fleet. But HexoKit never wraps the agent — a pane is just a pane. It's equally a build, a REPL, an ssh session, `htop`. **The agent is one of the things you run, not the thing HexoKit is.** That's the point: when the agent tooling churns underneath you (and it does, monthly), the terminal layer stays put.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://hexokit.com/install | sh
```

Installs the entire HexoKit toolkit via Homebrew, handling tap trust automatically. HexoKit relies on its sibling tools (`wt` for the riff worktree flow), so the full-toolkit install is the supported path. The formula also installs `rk` as a fully interchangeable short alias of `run-kit` — every command here works with either.

Requires **tmux ≥ 3.4** (checked at runtime; `rk doctor` reports your version). See the [install & access guide](docs/site/install.md) for prerequisites, upgrades, and troubleshooting.

## Quick start

Three commands from install to a guided tour:

```bash
rk daemon start                 # start the dashboard daemon on :3000
open http://localhost:3000      # open the dashboard (xdg-open on Linux)

# in a tmux session (tmux new -s work if you aren't in one):
rk tutorial                     # guided first run — an agent walks you through the product, act by act
```

Then spawn your first real agent workspace — a git worktree, a tmux window inside it, your agent launched:

```bash
rk riff                         # spawn an agent workspace (--skill /name picks the slash-command)
```

The new workspace appears in the sidebar; click into it to drive the agent — or any command — from the dashboard, on any device.

Two optional extras:

- `shll setup agent` (once per machine; run automatically at the end of a toolkit install) makes agent panes report live **busy/waiting/idle** state in the dashboard — see [Agent state](#agent-state).
- On a Mac, the [desktop app](#desktop-app-macos) is an alternative front door: `rk desktop install`, then one **Start & connect** click replaces the `daemon start` + `open` steps.

To upgrade later, `rk update` pulls the latest version via Homebrew and restarts the daemon. Coming from the old `rk` Homebrew formula, or something failing? See the [install & access guide](docs/site/install.md) and `rk doctor`.

## Why HexoKit?

|  | HexoKit |
|--|---------|
| **It is** | A remote, phone-first **console for your tmux** — agent-agnostic, no database, state derived from tmux + filesystem. A spawner (`rk riff`) and a dashboard (`rk serve`) that compose. |
| **It isn't** | An agent wrapper. It doesn't speak any agent's protocol, parse any agent's output, or care what's in the pane. That's deliberate — it's what makes it outlive whichever agent you run. |

- **One command per parallel agent** — `rk riff` creates a worktree, opens a tmux window in it, and launches your agent. `rk riff -N 3` spawns three workspaces in parallel; failures roll back cleanly.
- **Watch a whole fleet, from anywhere** — every tmux session and pane shows up in a sidebar. Click for a live browser terminal; pin several into a [board](#boards--watch-many-panes-at-once); open the same dashboard on your phone over Tailscale.
- **Mobile-first, keyboard-first** — `Cmd+K` command palette is the primary discovery surface. Touch targets are tuned for mobile so you can steer a session from your phone while away from your desk.
- **The dashboard layer over [`fab-kit`](https://github.com/sahil87/fab-kit) and [`wt`](https://github.com/sahil87/wt)** — `rk riff --skill /fab-fff` launches a full fab-kit pipeline in an isolated worktree. Reach for HexoKit when you have more parallel changes than one terminal can hold.

## The mental model

HexoKit is two independent halves that compose:

```
rk riff              rk serve
  ▼                    ▼
spawns agent        runs the
workspaces ─────►   browser dashboard
(tmux + worktree)   (watches tmux)
```

You can run either alone. Run `rk riff` in any tmux session without ever starting `rk serve` — you get the spawning behavior, no dashboard. Run `rk serve` and never call `rk riff` — you get a tmux browser dashboard for sessions you spawn manually. The two are designed to compose, not depend on each other.

## `rk riff` — the spawner

One invocation gives you a git worktree, a tmux window inside it, and one or more panes ready to go. The default pane runs your coding agent, but a pane can run anything — `rk riff` is a workspace launcher, not an agent launcher.

- **Pane array**: `--skill` and `--cmd` are repeatable; each occurrence adds one pane, in argv order.
- **Layouts**: `--layout` picks `auto` (default), `tiled`, `even-*`, or `main-*`.
- **Presets**: common pane/layout combos live in `fab/project/config.yaml` under `riff.presets.<name>`; invoke as `rk riff <name>`.
- **Parallel**: `-N <N>` spawns N workspaces; failures roll back before exiting.
- **wt passthrough**: flags after `--` go to `wt create` verbatim (e.g. `--base`, `--worktree-name`).

```bash
rk riff --skill /fab-fff --cmd "just dev"       # 2 panes (agent + dev server)
rk riff ship -N 3                               # 3 parallel 'ship' preset workspaces
```

**Prerequisites:** must be inside a tmux session, with [`wt`](https://github.com/sahil87/wt) and the launcher (default `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`) on `PATH`. In a fab-kit project, the launcher is resolved per-project through `fab agent` (the `providers` / `agent` tables in `fab/project/config.yaml`) — point it at any agent CLI, or any command at all.

See the [riff guide](docs/site/workflows.md) for the full reference.

## `rk serve` — the HTTP server

Start the HTTP server in the foreground. Configurable via `RK_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`) and `RK_PORT` (default `3000`).

```bash
rk serve                                # foreground on 127.0.0.1:3000
RK_HOST=0.0.0.0 RK_PORT=8080 rk serve   # bind all interfaces, port 8080
```

To run it in the background, use the `rk daemon` subcommands (`start`, `restart`, `stop`, `status`). The daemon runs in its own dedicated tmux server (`rk-daemon`), completely separate from your sessions; restarts are idempotent kill-and-restart with no polling loop or signal files. Restart the daemon and everything you're running keeps running — the console reconnects automatically.

The daemon also manages a **code-server** beside it, powering the dashboard's `code` lens — a full editor at the window's git root, served same-origin behind `/code/`. It installs itself on first daemon start (or `rk code-server install`); a code-server you installed yourself is respected and never touched. Details in the [install & access guide](docs/site/install.md#code-server-the-code-lens).

## Status dots — read every window at a glance

Each window in the sidebar, dashboard, and pane panel carries a single **status dot** that tells the window's **local story** — which journey runs in the pane, whether anyone is working right now, and whether the pipeline failed here — using two orthogonal channels plus three additive overlays, and a right-edge **PR glyph** for the remote story:

- **Hue = journey**: ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/building-60a5fa?label=) fab **building** (intake/apply/review) → ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/PR--ready-9ece6a?label=) fab **PR-ready / done** (ship/review-pr/done) · ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/agent-facc15?label=) an ad-hoc agent. A plain window is gray — color is reserved for a journey.
- **Shape = liveness**, the same meaning in every hue: **solid** = work happening now (agent mid-turn; floor: output flowing) · **ring** = at rest (no live worker, idle or waiting agent, parked done, quiet shell).
- **Overlays = additive flags**: a small **red center** flags a failed review/review-pr — inside the ring at rest, or as a **bullseye** (dark gap ring) over a solid while a rework agent is live; a **yellow halo** means an agent is waiting on you; a neutral **underbar** beneath the dot (sidebar row only) means the window is on the fab operator's watchlist.
- **PR glyph** (right edge): the branch's PR on GitHub — green open · yellow checks running · red failing · purple merged · gray draft. The dot never renders PR state.

See the [status dot reference](docs/site/status-dot.md) for the full legend, the per-state rendering, and the design rationale.

## Agent state

Windows running an AI agent can report a live lifecycle state in the sidebar and pane panel: **active** (turn in progress), **waiting** (blocked on you — a permission prompt or question), or **idle** (turn done, with elapsed duration). `waiting` is the state worth a glance at your phone: the agent isn't working, it's waiting for *you*.

This is opt-in and needs a one-time setup per machine — the toolkit-wide wiring covers it (and runs automatically at the end of a toolkit install):

```bash
shll setup agent            # places the shll toolkit skill + installs HexoKit's dashboard hooks
```

It delegates the hook install to `rk agent setup`, which shows the settings diff and asks before writing; `rk agent setup --uninstall` removes exactly the HexoKit-owned entries.

The setup installs agent-harness hooks into your user-global agent configs — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Kimi Code, OpenCode, and Antigravity CLI, each wired when its binary is on `PATH` — that stamp a `@rk_pane_agent_state` tmux pane option on lifecycle events. Each hook is a thin wrapper delegating to `rk agent hook`, so hook fixes ship in the binary and track `rk update` — no settings changes, no session restarts. Hooks work for any session, in any repo, under any workflow; re-running the setup is idempotent and never touches your other hooks. Until it's run (and agent sessions are restarted), agent state shows `—`. Codex additionally needs its native trust review: open `codex` and trust the HexoKit entries via `/hooks`.

The per-harness capability matrix (verified versions, event mappings, transcript support, honest gaps) lives in the [agent hook integrations guide](docs/site/agent-hooks.md); the cross-repo convention is documented in [`docs/specs/agent-state.md`](https://github.com/sahil87/run-kit/blob/main/docs/specs/agent-state.md); upgrading from an older hook generation is covered in the [install & access guide](docs/site/install.md#upgrade).

## The operator — one agent to run the server

`rk operator` opens the **operator** — a per-tmux-server singleton window running the fab-kit operator-tier agent, role-marked so the dashboard pins it. Where `rk riff` spawns workers, the operator is the coordinator you talk to: it watches the fleet, dispatches and unblocks changes, and escalates to your phone when something needs you. Requires fab-kit on `PATH`; re-running switches to the existing tab. Hand it a templated work item from the shell with `rk operator request <template>` (`--list` prints the registry; a busy operator queues the request and it drains when idle).

## Boards — watch many panes at once

A **board** is a named, cross-server pane dashboard: pin any tmux window from any server into it, and the board renders all pinned panes side-by-side — perfect for watching three parallel agent sessions next to the `just dev` server they're editing. Pin from the sidebar's pin icon or the `Cmd+K` palette; pin state lives in tmux, so the same board URL shows the same panes on your phone. See the [boards guide](docs/site/boards.md) for pinning, keyboard cycling, resizing, and mobile behavior.

## GUI — the host's desktop in a tile

The GUI surface runs the host's desktop as a fourth tile beside `tty`/`code`/`web`, off by default and shared by every viewer and every agent. `rk gui on` starts a private X display with a window manager and reveals the 4th tile button (⌘4). IceWM is the default desktop; pick another (LXQt, XFCE, Plasma, LXDE, MATE, Cinnamon) from Settings → `gui.wm` or with `rk gui wm <name>` — `rk gui wm --list` shows what's installed and what each missing one takes to install. See the [GUI guide](docs/site/gui.md) for desktops, resolution, phone controls, and troubleshooting.

## Drive it from your phone (HTTPS over Tailscale)

Some browser features (clipboard, secure context) require HTTPS. Accessing HexoKit from another machine on your tailnet also requires HTTPS:

1. Enable HTTPS at [DNS > HTTPS Certificates](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns).
2. Run `sudo tailscale set --operator=$USER` (one-time — lets `tailscale serve` run without sudo).
3. Run `tailscale serve --bg http://localhost:3000`.
4. Open `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net` on your phone or another laptop.

For a stable custom hostname or public access via Funnel, see the [Tailscale guide](docs/site/install.md#tailscale-https).

## Desktop app (macOS)

A native desktop shell — an Electron window that wraps your dashboard and frees the browser-reserved `⌘` keyboard tier. Install and update it with the CLI:

```sh
rk desktop install    # fetch the latest release DMG, install to /Applications
rk desktop update     # same, but a no-op when already current
```

The CLI path matters: it produces a quarantine-free, digest-verified install that opens cleanly — a browser-downloaded DMG gets blocked by Gatekeeper on every install and update. The app's welcome page connects three ways: **This Mac** (one-click daemon start), **over SSH** (bootstraps HexoKit on the remote box via `rk remote`), or **a URL**. It never starts, stops, or updates anything on its own, and your tmux sessions survive every daemon action. Details and the manual fallback are in the [install & access guide](docs/site/install.md#desktop-app-macos).

## Push notifications

Any process on the box can push a real OS-level notification to your phone or desktop — even when the dashboard tab is **closed** — via Web Push:

```sh
rk notify "deploy finished" --title "CI"
```

It's **fail-silent**: if the server is unreachable it exits 0 and prints nothing, so it never stalls a calling script or agent loop. Opt in from the browser via the **bell icon** in the top bar or `Cmd+K` → **Notifications: Enable push** (requires HTTPS or `localhost`). See the [notifications guide](docs/site/notifications.md) for setup and troubleshooting.

## Shell completion

`shll setup shell` wires tab-completion for every installed shll tool — including `run-kit` and the `rk` alias — into your rc file (zsh, bash), and runs automatically at the end of a toolkit install. Re-running is a no-op when the block is already present.

Prefer wiring just this tool by hand? `rk shell-init <shell>` emits the eval-safe block on its own:

```sh
eval "$(rk shell-init zsh)"   # in ~/.zshrc — also: bash, fish, powershell
```

## Command reference

Run `rk <command> --help` for full flag details, or see the [full command reference](https://shll.ai/run-kit/commands/) for every command and flag.

## Troubleshooting

- **`rk riff` fails with "not in a tmux session"** — riff requires `$TMUX` to be set. Start tmux first (`tmux new -s work`), then run `rk riff` inside it.
- **`rk riff` fails with "wt not found"** — install `wt` via `shll install wt`, or install the full toolkit from [https://shll.ai](https://shll.ai).
- **Agent state shows `—` for every window** — run `shll setup agent` once on the machine, then start a fresh agent session (hooks apply to new sessions, not already-running ones). A pane sitting at a plain shell also reads `—` by design.
- **Daemon misbehaving and a plain restart doesn't help** — `rk daemon restart --full` kills the entire rk-daemon tmux server (including the `rk-jobs`, `rk-code-server`, and `rk-remotes` sibling sessions) so the start births a genuinely fresh server, then reconnects any remote tunnels that were up. It refuses to run from a pane inside the rk-daemon server itself, where the kill would take down the invoking pane mid-restart.
- **Anything else broken** — run `rk doctor`. It checks tmux, `wt`, the launcher binary, port availability, and prints per-dependency status.
