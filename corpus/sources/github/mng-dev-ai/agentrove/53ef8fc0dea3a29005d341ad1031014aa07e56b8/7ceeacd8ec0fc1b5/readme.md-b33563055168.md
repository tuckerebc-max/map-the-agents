## What It Does

- Runs Antigravity, Claude, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Grok, and OpenCode through ACP adapters.
- Gives each workspace its own Docker or host sandbox.
- Combines chat, code editor, terminal, file tree, diffs, secrets, and git tools in one workspace.
- Supports workspaces from empty folders, git clones, existing local folders, or GitHub repositories.
- Streams agent sessions with cancellation, permission prompts, queued follow-up messages, file mentions, slash commands, and attachments.
- Includes sub-threads, pinned chats, worktree mode, personas, custom instructions, environment variables, and installed agent skills.
- Orchestrates multi-agent workflows through the bundled MCP server: a lead chat spawns worker sub-threads on any installed agent, model, and persona — in parallel worktrees when needed — then reviews their results.
- Provides GitHub-assisted repository browsing, pull request review, PR creation, reviewer selection, and git branch/commit/push/pull helpers.
- Ships as a Docker web app, a macOS desktop app, and a native iOS app.

## Orchestrating Agents

Agentrove chats aren't just endpoints — they can drive each other. The bundled MCP server (`mcp-server/`) exposes the whole instance as tools (`send_message`, `get_messages`, `list_models`, `list_personas`, …), and every chat's agent has those tools available. That turns any chat into an orchestrator: a lead agent on a strong model that decomposes the work, routes each task to the right agent, and reviews what comes back.

The primitives:

- **Sub-threads** — `send_message(parent_chat_id=…)` creates a worker chat grouped under the lead chat, in the same workspace and branch. Sub-threads stay flat (no nesting): the lead fans out, workers report back.
- **Per-turn model and persona** — each worker runs on any installed agent and model (`model_id`) with any persona (a custom system prompt). Typical fleet: a fast model with a read-only scout persona for codebase exploration, coding models for implementation, dedicated reviewer personas (bug hunting, structural quality) for QA. `list_models` reports each model's supported reasoning tiers (`thinking_modes`), so the lead dials effort per task.
- **Isolated worktrees** — `worktree=true` gives a worker its own git worktree, so parallel workers edit concurrently without conflicts.
- **Polling and follow-ups** — the lead polls `get_messages` until a worker's turn completes, judges the result against the actual code, and sends rework to the worker's own thread; follow-ups inherit the thread's previous model, persona, and reasoning settings.
- **Unattended turns** — orchestrated turns run in the agent's full-execution mode, so workers finish without permission prompts.

A typical loop: the lead explores with a cheap fast model, hands a precise spec to a coding model in a sub-thread, fans reviewer personas out over the diff in parallel, triages their findings, delegates the accepted fixes — and owns the final result. Models, personas, and routing rules are all user-defined, so the same machinery drives whatever fleet you run.

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mng-dev-ai/agentrove.git
cd agentrove
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `SECRET_KEY` in `.env`:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Start Agentrove:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Antigravity supports authentication through Google OAuth completed in a terminal. Its ACP tokens live in `~/.gemini/antigravity-acp/`, separately from the Antigravity CLI login.

## Desktop

Agentrove also has a macOS desktop app built with Tauri. It starts a bundled Python backend sidecar on an available `127.0.0.1` port and connects the frontend to it at launch.

- Download the latest Apple Silicon build from [Releases](https://github.com/Mng-dev-ai/agentrove/releases/latest).
- Build from source:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run desktop:dev
```

## Mobile (iOS)

Agentrove also builds a native iOS app with Tauri. Since iOS can't run the local
backend sidecar, the app is a thin client: it talks to an Agentrove instance you
already host (your Docker or production deployment), reachable from the phone over
`https`/`wss`. Because the project is open source, you build and sign it yourself —
nothing is hardcoded to anyone else's server.

Requirements: macOS with Xcode (plus its iOS SDK and Simulator), the Rust iOS
targets (`rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim`), and CocoaPods.

> If your device runs an iOS beta whose SDK isn't in a stable Xcode yet, build against the latest stable Xcode's SDK (`sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app`) — apps built with an older SDK still run on newer iOS.

Point the app at your instance:

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.mobile.example .env.mobile   # then set your https/wss URLs
npm install
```

Run in the simulator:

```bash
npm run ios:dev
```

Install on your own iPhone with a free Apple ID — no paid developer account needed
(the app must be re-signed every 7 days):

1. `npm run tauri ios init` generates the Xcode project (first run only).
2. Open `frontend/src-tauri/gen/apple/*.xcodeproj` in Xcode once, pick your Team
   under **Signing & Capabilities**, and connect your iPhone (Xcode needs to
   register the device and create the provisioning profile).
3. On the phone, enable Developer Mode (**Settings → Privacy & Security**), then
   after the first install trust the certificate under
   **Settings → General → VPN & Device Management**.

Build a standalone `.ipa` and install it on the connected iPhone. The easiest path
is the bundled helper, which builds, signs, exports, and installs in one step. It
reads your team from `APPLE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` (so nothing is hardcoded to anyone
else's team) and auto-detects the connected device:

```bash
export APPLE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=<YOUR_TEAM_ID>   # find it in Xcode → Signing & Capabilities
cd frontend
npm run ios:install
```

Or run the steps yourself. The `-c` flag injects the team into both the build
signing and the IPA export, so it stays out of the committed config:

```bash
npm run ios:build -- --export-method debugging \
  -c '{"bundle":{"iOS":{"developmentTeam":"<YOUR_TEAM_ID>"}}}'
# -> src-tauri/gen/apple/build/arm64/Agentrove.ipa

xcrun devicectl list devices   # find your device id
xcrun devicectl device install app --device <DEVICE_ID> \
  src-tauri/gen/apple/build/arm64/Agentrove.ipa
```

To update the app later, re-run `npm run ios:install` — the standalone build runs on
the phone without keeping a Mac connected.

## Production

For a single-host Docker deployment:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com \
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com \
docker compose -f docker-compose-production.yml up -d --build
```
