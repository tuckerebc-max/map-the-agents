# Public Skills

OMK currently publishes **30 project-local skills** in this repository under [`.omk/skills`](.omk/skills). When OMK runs from a repository checkout, it discovers these skills automatically and loads them on demand.

These repository skills are **not bundled into the `open-multi-agent-kit` npm package**. The package publishes only the paths declared in [`packages/coding-agent/package.json`](packages/coding-agent/package.json). See the [skills documentation](packages/coding-agent/docs/skills.md) for discovery rules and packaging your own skills.

Invoke any available skill with `!skill:<name>` or `/skill:<name>`. `caveman` is explicit-only; the others may be selected when their descriptions match the task.

## Distribution and provenance

- **Public repository:** all 30 skills above are tracked in Git.
- **Not listed:** `system-prompts-leaks` and `omk-godmod` are machine-local research corpora that `.gitignore` marks "never version or publish". They were advertised here while shipping in no commit, so every link was a 404 for anyone but their author.
- **Repository checkout:** OMK discovers them as project-local skills.
- **npm package:** none of these root-level `.omk/skills` files are currently included in `open-multi-agent-kit`.
- **Vendored content:** [`taste-skill`](.omk/skills/taste-skill/SOURCE.md), [`caveman`](.omk/skills/caveman/SOURCE.md), [`ponytail`](.omk/skills/ponytail/SKILL.md), [`clone-website`](.omk/skills/clone-website/LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY), and [`context7-mcp`](.omk/skills/context7-mcp/LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY) retain their source and license notices.
- **Derived, not vendored:** [`omk-higgsfield`](.omk/skills/omk-higgsfield/SOURCE.md) is original prose pinned to an upstream commit; it copies no upstream file.
- **Excluded from this inventory:** machine-local skills, test fixtures, examples, scratch data, goal snapshots, and worktrees.
