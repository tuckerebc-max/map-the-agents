A session manager for AI coding agents on Linux and macOS. Run agents in
parallel across branches, monitor them from the TUI or a browser, and keep each
one in a persistent session with optional worktree and container isolation.

## How It Works

Each agent runs in its own [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) session, so your agents keep running when you close the TUI, disconnect SSH, or your terminal crashes. Reopen `aoe` and everything is exactly where you left it.

The key tmux shortcut to know: **`Ctrl+b d`** detaches from a session and returns to the TUI.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) (required), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for sandboxing)

```bash
# Quick install (Linux & macOS)
curl -fsSL \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agent-of-empires/agent-of-empires/main/scripts/install.sh \
  | bash

# Homebrew
brew install aoe

# Nix
nix run github:agent-of-empires/agent-of-empires

# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/agent-of-empires/agent-of-empires
cd agent-of-empires && cargo build --release
```

## Quick Start

```bash
aoe                          # Launch the TUI
aoe add --cmd claude         # Create a session running Claude Code
aoe serve                    # Start the web dashboard
```

In the TUI, press `?` for help. The bottom information bar shows all available keybindings in context.

## Roadmap

The AoE roadmap is public: see the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/agent-of-empires/projects/1) for what's planned, in progress, and recently shipped. Issues and PRs welcome.

## FAQ

### What happens when I close aoe?

Nothing. Sessions are tmux sessions running in the background. Open and close `aoe` as often as you like. Sessions only get removed when you explicitly delete them.

### Which AI tools are supported?

Run `aoe agents` for the current list and availability on your machine.

### Can I use AoE over SSH?

Yes. Sessions persist across disconnects; reconnect and run `aoe` again.

### Does it work on Windows?

Only through WSL2. AoE depends on tmux and POSIX process handling, so native Windows is not supported.

### How is this different from just using tmux directly?

tmux gives you persistent sessions. AoE adds agent-aware status detection (running, waiting, idle, error), git worktree management, Docker sandboxing, a web dashboard, remote phone access, and a diff viewer, all wrapped around your existing tmux workflow. You can still `tmux attach` to any AoE session directly.

## Development
