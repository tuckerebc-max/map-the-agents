  <br>
  A diagram illustrating the general training, inference, and evaluation workflow for Code LLMs and their associated databases. 
  The training workflow is mainly divided into four distinct stages: 
  Stage ① and ② are the pre-training phase, whereas Stages ③ and ④ represent the post-training phases. It is important to note that Stage ② and ④ are optional. 
  For instance, StarCoder incorporates only Stage ①. WizardCoder, fine-tuned upon StarCoder, includes only Stage ③, while Code Llama, continually pre-trained on Llama 2, encompasses Stages ② and ③. DeepSeek-Coder-V2, continually pre-trained on DeepSeek-V2, covers Stages ②, ③, and ④. 
  Note that pre-trained model can be directly used for inference by prompt engineering.
