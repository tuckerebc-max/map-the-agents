Orbit Editor is an open-source AI code editor forked from [Void Editor](https://github.com/voideditor/void) and [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). Run AI agents on your codebase, checkpoint and visualize changes, and bring any model or host locally — messages go directly to providers without retaining your data.

This repo contains the full source code for Orbit Editor's desktop app. If you're new, welcome!

## Features

- **AI agents** — Run agents that understand your codebase, with support for subagents and configurable tool policies.
- **Bring your own model** — Connect any provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local) or run models locally. Messages go directly to the provider without retaining your data.
- **Checkpoints & change visualization** — Inspect, revert, and replay edits as you work, with a clear view of what changed and why.
- **Plan mode** — Collaboratively design an implementation approach before any code is written.
- **MCP integration** — Extend agent capabilities with Model Context Protocol servers.
- **Skills** — Reusable, scoped workflows that encode project-specific knowledge and best practices.

## Download

Orbit Editor is currently in **beta** and available for **macOS** (Apple Silicon and Intel). Windows and Linux support is coming soon.

**Recommended — verified one-line install:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashish200729/orbiteditor/main/install.sh | bash
```

This verifies the signed update manifest, DMG checksum, and app code signature
before installing Orbit into `/Applications`.

**Alternative — download the `.dmg`** from
[Releases](https://github.com/ashish200729/orbiteditor/releases) or
[orbiteditorai.com](https://orbiteditorai.com), then drag Orbit to Applications.
Because Orbit is not (yet) notarized by Apple, a DMG downloaded through a browser
is quarantined and macOS shows *"Apple could not verify Orbit is free of
malware."* You can approve it once using either supported macOS flow:

- Right-click `Orbit.app` → **Open** → **Open Anyway**, or
- System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Open Anyway**
