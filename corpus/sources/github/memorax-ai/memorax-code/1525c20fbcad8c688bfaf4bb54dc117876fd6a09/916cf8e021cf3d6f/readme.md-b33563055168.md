## Make Every Interaction the Starting Point for the Next

Coding agents are good at the task in front of them, but a new session often
starts without the architecture, failed attempts, repository rules, or working
preferences established before it.

MemoraX Code gives Codex, Claude Code, CodeBuddy CLI, WorkBuddy, DeepSeek Harness,
OpenCode, and Trae a shared memory layer for that context.
It can recall prior engineering knowledge, capture reusable lessons from
completed work, maintain repository knowledge, and carry your procedures and
preferences into future sessions.

The goal is not to remember everything. It is to bring back the small amount of
memory relevant to the current task so the agent can reach useful investigation
and validation sooner.

## Quick Start

Prepare Node.js 20+ (Node.js 24 LTS recommended) and at least one of Codex,
Claude Code, CodeBuddy CLI, WorkBuddy, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, or Trae.

For DeepSeek Harness (DSH), current releases require Node.js
`^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`. Install or initialize DSH first, create at least one
Profile, and ensure `pnpm` is on `PATH` before running setup. MemoraX Code
does not install or update DSH.

On Linux, guest credentials require `/usr/bin/secret-tool` from
libsecret and an available Secret Service in the current user session. For
Remote SSH, WSL, or Dev Containers, install MemoraX Code in the same environment
as the coding agent. MemoraX search and writeback require network access.

### Install and Connect

#### 1. Install the Package

```bash
npm install -g @memorax/memorax-code
```

This installs the package; it does not start interactive setup. Do not use
`--ignore-scripts`: npm lifecycle scripts safely stop and restore an existing
running managed Backend during package replacement.

#### 2. Connect a MemoraX Account (Recommended)

[Create a MemoraX account](https://platform.memorax.net/) or use an existing
one, then run from a normal interactive terminal:

```bash
memorax-code setup --existing-account
```

Follow the setup prompts to enter your MemoraX username and API key locally.

For a coding agent without an interactive terminal, pass the API key through
stdin. The examples assume `MEMORAX_SETUP_API_KEY` is already provided by the
caller. Do not put the key in command arguments or project files.

```bash
printf '%s\n' "$MEMORAX_SETUP_API_KEY" | memorax-code setup --existing-account --non-interactive
```

In Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:MEMORAX_SETUP_API_KEY | memorax-code.cmd setup --existing-account --non-interactive
```

This explicit command replaces the saved key and uses the detected local
username and system language. It reports `API Key match: true` after local
configuration and readiness checks; this does not verify cloud credentials.
See [non-interactive setup](docs/configuration.md#existing-account-setup-without-a-terminal)
for input and reuse behavior.

> [!TIP]
> Using MemoraX Code across devices? Find the username and API key in the
> configuration file on a configured device (normally
> `~/.memorax-code/config.toml`), then enter them in the local setup terminal
> on the new device. This file contains your API key; keep it private and
> never paste it into chats or public issues.

#### Or Try Without an Account (90-Day Guest Mode)

To start immediately and connect an account later, run:

```bash
memorax-code setup
```

Default setup reuses a complete existing connection. Otherwise, it detects
your local username and language, asks when needed, and creates or restores
guest credentials. To replace the saved connection, use
`memorax-code setup --reconfigure` for guest mode or
`memorax-code setup --existing-account` for a registered account.

To keep your guest memory when registering later, first run this command
directly in your local terminal:

```bash
memorax-code account --show-mark-id
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Obtain the Mark ID before registering, then use it to activate your guest
> account on [MemoraX](https://platform.memorax.net/). The platform does not
> currently support attaching a Mark ID to an account that has already been
> registered.

#### 3. Activate and Verify

Both setup paths automatically detect supported coding agents. Restart or
refresh every detected coding agent after setup.

| Client | Complete activation |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | Enable **MemoraX Code Codex Adapter** from Plugins or `/plugins` if it is not already enabled. |
| Claude Code | Restart or refresh the client to load the managed plugin and Hooks. |
| CodeBuddy CLI | Start a new CLI session to load the managed plugin, Hooks, and Skill. |
| WorkBuddy | Restart WorkBuddy to load its independently managed plugin, Hooks, and Skill. |
| DeepSeek Harness | Restart or refresh DSH to load the plugin registered in existing Profiles. |
| OpenCode | Restart or refresh the client to discover the managed plugin and Skill. |
| Trae | In **Settings → Hooks → Global → Configured Hooks**, enable the registered Global Hooks once. Setup installs the Hooks and Skill; this switch requires manual activation. |

Open a project, start a new client session, and send one prompt. Then run
these commands from the project directory:

```bash
memorax-code --version
memorax-code status
memorax-cli status
```

In Windows PowerShell, use `memorax-cli.cmd status`. A configured integration
may still report `hook-runtime=unverified` until the client executes its Hook.
After a Hook executes successfully, that client's Hook runtime should change
to `observed`.

`memorax-code status` checks the local Backend and client integrations;
`memorax-cli status` checks the local memory configuration and workspace scope.
Neither command sends a test request to MemoraX. A real search or write verifies
remote connectivity and credentials; follow the cross-session example below.
For client-specific diagnostic commands, see
[Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md).

### Installation Troubleshooting

Package installation does not launch setup automatically; run one of the setup
commands above, using stdin mode when an agent has no interactive terminal.
For incomplete setup or unavailable memory, start with the status commands and follow
[Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md).

#### Windows: `memorax-code` or `memorax-cli` Is Not Found

Both commands are included in the same package. Follow the
[Windows PATH repair steps](docs/troubleshooting.md#windows-memorax-code-or-memorax-cli-is-not-found)
to bootstrap setup or repair a stale terminal environment.

### Try Cross-Session Memory

Clone the example repository from the product website, then open Codex, Claude
Code, CodeBuddy CLI, WorkBuddy, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, or Trae in the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SWE-agent/test-repo.git
cd test-repo
```

Invoke the Skill as `$memorax-code` in Codex or `/memorax-code` in Claude Code
or DeepSeek Harness. In OpenCode, CodeBuddy CLI, WorkBuddy, or Trae, ask the agent
to use the `memorax-code` skill by name. The prompts below use its product name
and work in all supported clients.

Send these prompts in order in the same session:

> 1. Use the MemoraX Code skill to build Repo
>    Memory, retrieving only the latest 3 issues, pull requests, and commits.
> 2. Review the recent Repo Memory issue: the zeroth number was once calculated
>    incorrectly. Avoid repeating the same problem now.
> 3. Use the MemoraX Code skill to remember the
>    engineering lesson from this coding task.

Close the current conversation, start a new session in the same repository,
and send:

> Use the MemoraX Code skill to recall the earlier
> engineering lesson and suggest what to check.

The agent should retrieve the saved lesson and use it to make suggestions for
the current repository.

> [!TIP]
> The prompts above are only for quick verification. In normal use, you do not
> need to invoke the MemoraX Code skill to add memory manually. It writes
> relevant memory in the background and guides agents to search when useful.
> Local activity and status are retained as content-controlled trace and reconciliation records under `MEMORAX_CODE_HOME`.

## Four Clear Memory Boundaries

| Memory | The question it answers | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Coding&nbsp;Memory** | What engineering lessons should carry into the next task? | Verified fixes, failed approaches, design rationale, pitfalls, and regression checks |
| **Repo&nbsp;Memory** | What should an agent know about this repository? | Architecture maps, module ownership, entry points, and commit/PR/MR/issue evidence |
| **Personal&nbsp;Memory** | How should the agent communicate and collaborate with you? | User Profile preferences such as language, tone, explanation depth, and result format |
| **Procedure&nbsp;Memory** | How should this kind of task be carried out? | Reusable steps, checklists, prerequisites, exceptions, and validation gates |

Personal Memory and Procedure Memory stay in the current repository under
`.repo_memory/`. When saved content already exists, MemoraX Code compares its
meaning before writing: an equivalent request makes no change; a durable
refinement or conflict updates the matching entry and removes the superseded
wording; an invalid scope is corrected, or the entry is deleted only when it is
wholly obsolete. An explicit forget request deletes only the named preference,
procedure topic, section, or step and leaves unrelated memory unchanged.
One-time task instructions do not change saved memory, and the Agent asks before
writing when the durable intent or target is unclear.

## Product Capabilities

| Capability | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Background memory writeback** | Extracts reusable knowledge from completed turns and writes it to Coding Memory in the background. |
| **Preference continuity** | Records User Profile preferences and injects them into future tasks on a configured cadence. |
| **Procedure reuse** | Records reusable task procedures and reminds future agents to apply them. |
| **Visible memory impact** | In Codex, Claude Code, CodeBuddy CLI, WorkBuddy, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, and Trae, opens the final answer with a brief natural-language note when an explicit Coding Memory Search or a Repo, Procedure, or Profile Memory available to the current turn materially guided the task. |
| **Background Repo Memory maintenance** | Automatically organizes repository structure, entry points, and history evidence in supported headless-capable clients, then updates them according to policy to reduce repeated searching and summarization. Trae can use the Skill for Repo Memory, but does not currently expose a headless worker for automatic maintenance. |
| **Active memory control** | Lets you search and add memory through the bundled MemoraX Code skill or the CLI. |
| **Client integration** | Integrates with Codex, Claude Code, CodeBuddy CLI, WorkBuddy, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, and Trae to trigger memory retrieval, reminders, and writeback. Automatic quota reminders are currently available in Codex, Claude Code, CodeBuddy CLI, WorkBuddy, OpenCode, and Trae. |
| **Local observability** | Uses content-controlled local trace and reconciliation records to inspect activity counts, retrieval, and writeback status. |

## Your Memory, Your Control

MemoraX is required for cloud-backed memory. Completing setup activates
MemoraX search/add and the generated configuration's automatic writeback;
there is no second writeback confirmation. Automatic retrieval remains off
until explicitly enabled.

Local trace capture is enabled by default for supported clients. Depending on
client capabilities, retained traces under `MEMORAX_CODE_HOME` may contain
prompts, responses, recalled memory, reminder text, and local paths. Use the
[local trace settings](docs/configuration.md#local-traces) to switch to
metadata-only capture or disable a client's trace.
Minimal local session state remains when trace is disabled so memory operations
keep the correct workspace scope.

Coding Memory follows the repository or workspace. Recognized default chat
directories in Codex, WorkBuddy, and OpenCode share `General` under the same
configured MemoraX user ID. Existing memories are not migrated; see
[memory scope](docs/configuration.md#memory-scope) for the directory rules.

Guest quota reminders may display the complete Mark ID. Treat reminder text
and retained traces containing it as sensitive.

Active memory operations send their query or selected content to MemoraX.
Automatic writeback sends selected user instructions and the matching final
Agent response from trusted workspace turns after removing the final-answer
memory-impact disclosure, then extracts and stores reusable memory. It
does not upload the complete retained client trace artifact or local trace
path.

QA writeback preserves available native timestamps and labels observation-time
fallbacks; see [message timestamps](docs/configuration.md#automatic-writeback-timestamps).

Sign in to [MemoraX Console](https://platform.memorax.net/) at any time to view,
edit, or delete saved memories. MemoraX Cloud does not receive model-provider
credentials or local Backend tokens.

Read [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for all settings and
[Security](SECURITY.md) for network, local-data, and retention boundaries.

## Update

For a global npm installation:

```bash
memorax-code update
```

Setup also enables background updates while the managed Backend is running.
An update briefly stops a running managed Backend and restores it with the
retained client selection.
See [update settings](docs/configuration.md#setup-automatic-update-and-package-transition-state)
for release channels, custom state roots, client selection, Backend restoration,
and disabling background checks. Restart or refresh a client after an update
changes integration assets it has already loaded.
If package replacement fails, follow the [update recovery steps](docs/troubleshooting.md#npm-package-transition-fails)
for `memorax-code update --recover`.

### Windows Upgrade Note

For older Windows installations that fail with an `EBUSY` rename error, follow
the [legacy upgrade recovery](docs/troubleshooting.md#npm-package-transition-fails).

## Uninstall

Run the product lifecycle before removing the npm package:

```bash
memorax-code uninstall
```

This removes managed integrations and the global package while retaining
configuration and stored memories. Do not run `npm uninstall -g` first: it can
remove the product command before client integration cleanup runs. See
[Uninstall and Retention](SECURITY.md#uninstall-and-retention) for the complete
retained-data list.

After a complete uninstall and reinstall, run `memorax-code setup` again;
default setup reuses a complete retained connection. A normal
`memorax-code stop` or partial client uninstall preserves setup completion.
