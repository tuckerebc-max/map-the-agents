# 🚀 Building Intelligent Apps with Anaconda

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anaconda-Labs/building-intelligent-apps-with-anaconda/main/.github/badges/status.json?1788771726&cacheSeconds=300)](https://github.com/Anaconda-Labs/building-intelligent-apps-with-anaconda)

> **Mission status: Ready for lift-off**

A hands-on curriculum for building production-grade intelligent applications with the Anaconda ecosystem. Every module is a self-contained < 7-minute narrated demo with pre-run outputs or script `run_demo.sh` — designed to show the code and the decisions, not walk you through setup.

Our data is real: WASP-18 b, a hot Jupiter exoplanet caught transiting its star by NASA's TESS telescope. We process its light curve, build agents to reason about it, deploy those agents to production, secure the supply chain, and ship the result — to a browser tab, to a native app, to an air-gapped server 800km away. Same data. Every module.

The payload — `ingestion.py` and `ValidationReport` — never changes. What changes is where it runs and what reasons about it.

## 📡 Modules

### `-1` — MCP: Pre-flight Checklist
**Make sure ground control can hear you.**
Time: ~5 minutes 

The Model Context Protocol is how AI assistants talk to Anaconda tools. Before the first `conda install`, verify your MCP setup so Claude Desktop can manage environments, query packages, and inspect CVEs on your behalf.

Tools: `anaconda-mcp`, Claude Desktop

---

### `00` — Foundation: The Launch Pad
**You can't reach orbit without a stable platform.**
Time: ~1-3 minutes

Every agent, every pipeline step, every GPU kernel in this curriculum runs inside a conda environment. This module makes that concrete: why conda, how environment isolation works, and the tools that turn a fleeting `pip install` into a reproducible, lockable, shippable artifact.

Tools: `conda`, `conda-pypi` (experimental), `conda-forge`, Anaconda Distribution

---

### `01` — Data Sources: First Contact
**Raw photons from 1,300 light-years away, cleaned up and ready for agents.**
Time: ~1-3 minutes

Built on Daina Bouquin's [polars_demo](https://github.com/dbouquin/polars_demo) — a real TESS phase-folded light curve of WASP-18 b, a hot Jupiter completing an orbit every 22 hours. We extend it into a production-ready pipeline: schema enforcement, Pydantic validation, IsolationForest anomaly detection, and the `ValidationReport` that every subsequent module consumes.

```
PHASE | LC_DETREND | MODEL_INIT
──────────────────────────────
The three columns that travel through the entire curriculum.
```

- `ingestion.py` — `load_lightcurve()`, `validate_lightcurve()`, schema enforcement
- `ValidationReport` — typed Pydantic output, JSON-serialisable, agent-ready
- IsolationForest — transit anomaly detection without labelled data
- `agent_context` — the structured payload that becomes Module 02's agent input

Tools: `Polars`, `scikit-learn`, `Pydantic`, `ingestion.py`

---

### `02` — Your First Agent: One Crew Member
**A single agent, two tools, a classification.**
Time: ~3 minutes

`ingestion.py` functions become LangGraph tools. One agent calls `load_lightcurve`, passes the result to `validate_lightcurve`, reasons over the `ValidationReport`, and returns a structured transit classification. Claude Haiku is the default crew member — swap the `base_url` for AI Navigator or Anaconda Desktop to fly offline. Demo can be completed without model access, but stops at what will be served to the model.

Default LLM: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` via Anthropic API, or AI Navigator local server.

Tools: `LangGraph`, `Anthropic` or `openai` client

---

### `03` — Multi-Agent Architecture: Assemble the Crew
**Two agents, one supervisor, `foreach` parallelism across 50 targets.**
Time: ~5 minutes

`DataAgent` and `AnalysisAgent` fly in formation, coordinated by a LangGraph supervisor. Metaflow wraps the whole operation as a `FlowSpec` — each agent role gets its own isolated, lockable environment. A dependency conflict between Polars and LangGraph is structurally impossible.

```
start → ingest (polars, scikit-learn)
      → analyze (openai, langgraph)
      → join → end
```

Tools: `LangGraph`, `Metaflow` 2.18+, `FlowSpec`

---

### `04` — Deployment and Inference: Mission Control Endpoints
**Three LLM targets, one agent interface, zero code changes.**
Time: ~3 minutes

The agents from Module 03 call an LLM via the `openai` client. That client points at a URL. This module shows what lives at the URL — and proves that swapping it is a one-line env var change.

| Target | `base_url` | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| AI Navigator | `http://localhost:8080/v1` | Local dev, no API key |
| vLLM (self-hosted) | `http://server:8000/v1` | Production GPU, full control |
| Anaconda Platform | `$MODEL_SERVER_BASE_URL` | Enterprise, governed, AIBOM |

Anaconda Platform adds: Model Catalog with HellaSwag/WinoGrande/TruthfulQA benchmarks, downloadable AIBOM (CycloneDX JSON), Responsible AI scoring via Gray Swan, Model Governance for org-wide policy.

Supporting docs in `deploy/`: `ai-navigator.md`, `vllm.md`, `anaconda-platform.md`

Tools: vLLM, Anaconda Platform Model Servers, `inference_client.py`

---

### `05` — GPU-Accelerated Intelligence: Afterburners
**Same pipeline. NVIDIA iron. 47× faster feature engineering.**
Time: UNKNOWN - experimental

The Module 03 flow gets a CUDA upgrade. `compute_features` moves from Polars CPU rolling windows to a CUDA Python 1.0 kernel. The LLM switches from Claude Haiku to Nemotron 3 Nano on vLLM via Brev. The agents don't know any of this happened.

```
Module 03                    Module 05
─────────────────────────    ────────────────────────────────
@conda per step   same  →    + nvidia channel, cuda-python
ingestion.py      same  →    same functions
Claude Haiku            →    Nemotron 3 Nano (BF16) on vLLM
CPU rolling windows     →    CUDA Python kernel
no sandbox              →    NemoClaw security layer (alpha)
```

**What each NVIDIA tool actually is (not Python imports):**
- **Brev** — CLI to provision an L40S in ~3 minutes: `brev create`
- **CUDA Python 1.0** — `from cuda.core.experimental import Device` — direct kernel access
- **Nemotron** — HuggingFace model, served via vLLM, called via `openai` client
- **NemoClaw** — TypeScript CLI + Python blueprint, sandboxed agent runtime (alpha)

**conda-pypi note:** vLLM is PyPI-only. The `pip:` section in `environment.yml` is the current pragmatic path. `conda-pypi` (experimental, Q1 2026) is the safer long-term approach — converts wheels to `.conda` format, integrates with the solver. Track: [conda/conda-pypi](https://github.com/conda/conda-pypi)

Benchmarks (50 light curves): **47.5× feature engineering speedup · 4.8× end-to-end**

Tools: Brev, CUDA Python 1.0, vLLM, Nemotron 3 Nano (BF16), NemoClaw

---

### `06` — App Architecture: Mission Hardening
**The pipeline that keeps flying when things go wrong.**
Time: ~5-7 minutes

Module 03's flow works on good data with a responsive LLM. This module adds four additive patterns that keep it running in production:

```
Pattern              Metaflow tool         What it solves
─────────────────    ──────────────────    ────────────────────────────────────────
Graceful degradation @catch                One bad target doesn't abort the mission
Eval-as-CI           evaluate step         Assertions run every execution, fail loud
Observability        @card                 HTML reports per target + per run
Agent memory         DuckDB vector store   Past results injected as context at inference
```

The `evaluate` step runs assertion functions from `evals/assertions.py` — plain Python, no Metaflow dependency, testable with pytest. Critical failures raise `AssertionError`. The `@card` on `end` is the single view you check after every production run.

The DuckDB memory store (from the vector DB comparison: pgvector / MongoDB Atlas / Neo4j / **DuckDB** — embedded, portable, `conda-pack`-able) gives agents memory across runs: past `ValidationReport` results retrieved by cosine similarity and injected into the system prompt.

Tools: LangGraph, Pydantic, DuckDB, Metaflow: FlowSpec, `@catch`, `@card`, `@conda`, `@retry`

---

### `07` — Mission-Critical Infrastructure: No Failures Tolerated"
**Prove the environment is safe before it flies.**

Supply chain security isn't a feature you add at the end. It's the infrastructure the pipeline runs on. Five layers, zero pipeline code changes:

```
Layer    Tool                               The question it answers
───────  ─────────────────────────────────  ─────────────────────────────────────────
Lock     conda-lockfiles                    Is this environment bit-for-bit reproducible?
Scan     anaconda-audit                     Does it contain known vulnerabilities?
Gate     Anaconda Platform policy filter    Did anything vulnerable get in upstream?
Pack     conda-pack                         Can we deploy without internet access?
Verify   AIBOM + SHA-256                    Is the model file what we think it is?
```

- `anaconda-audit scan --name app-architecture` — CVE scan against NVD/NIST, Anaconda-curated statuses (Active / Cleared / Mitigated / Disputed)
- Policy filters block packages with CVE score ≥ 7 or Active status before they reach your channel
- `conda-lockfiles` turns a floating `environment.yml` into a pinned deployment contract
- `conda-pack` ships the entire environment as a relocatable tarball — Python, CUDA binaries, DuckDB memory store — to a machine with no conda, no internet
- AIBOM (CycloneDX JSON from Anaconda Platform Model Catalog) includes SHA-256 checksums, benchmark scores, ethical considerations, software dependencies

CI script: `lock_and_scan.sh` — lock → scan → gate, exits 1 on critical CVEs.
Deploy script: `pack_and_ship.sh` — AIBOM verify → conda-pack → scp to target.

Tools: `anaconda-audit`, `conda-lockfiles`, `conda-pack`, Anaconda Platform, `verify_aibom.py`

---

### `08` — Native Apps: Escape Velocity
**The same pipeline, delivered everywhere Python runs.**

An addendum. Not required. The answer to: *after all that, where else can this fly?*

Two options, same five exoplanet targets, same IsolationForest pipeline, same `ValidationReport` schema:

**Option A — PyScript** *(Python in the browser, no server)*

Launched by Anaconda at PyCon US 2022. Pyodide loads a full CPython interpreter into your browser tab via WebAssembly. One HTML file. Select a target → Run Analysis → validation report + three matplotlib charts render in the page. numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn all bundled in Pyodide.

```bash
cd 08-native-apps && python -m http.server 8080
# open http://localhost:8080 — that's it
```

**Option B — BeeWare** *(Python as a native OS app)*

Funded by Anaconda. Briefcase packages the same Python source into native apps for every platform. Toga maps Python widgets to native OS controls (NSTableView on macOS, GtkTreeView on Linux, ListView on Windows). One `pyproject.toml`, six targets.

```bash
cd 08-native-apps
pip install briefcase
briefcase dev        # opens a native window immediately
briefcase package    # → .dmg / .msi / AppImage / .ipa / .aab
```

See `BUILDING.md` for the complete per-platform build guide including signing, distribution, and the full Briefcase command lifecycle.

Tools: PyScript (Pyodide/WASM), BeeWare (Briefcase + Toga)

---

### `09` — Web App: Ground Control
**The same pipeline, served as an interactive web app.**
Time: ~1-3 minutes

An addendum. The answer to: *how do you put this in front of a non-Python user?*

The Module 01 IsolationForest pipeline becomes a Panel app served by a Bokeh server. Same five exoplanet targets, same `ValidationReport` schema — what changes is the delivery layer. Reactive widgets stream updates to the browser over a websocket as the pipeline runs. No page reloads, no CSV, no setup for the end user.

```bash
conda env create -f 09-web-app/environment.yml
conda activate panel-app
panel serve app.py --show
# Opens http://localhost:5006/app
```

The app surfaces the pipeline as four tabs per run: a live pipeline log, the full ValidationReport as formatted stats, a sortable Tabulator grid of the top 50 anomalous points, and a phase-folded lightcurve plot with anomalies highlighted and the IsolationForest score panel below.

`panel-material-ui` provides the Material Design sidebar, tabs, and buttons. `hvplot` turns the pipeline's pandas DataFrames into HoloViews plots in a single method call.

Tools: `Panel`, `HoloViews`, `hvplot`, `panel-material-ui`, `param`

## 🌠 Prerequisites

```bash
# Anaconda Distribution or Miniconda
# https://www.anaconda.com/download

conda --version   # 26.5.x or later

# Free Anaconda account — required for AI Navigator and Platform features
# https://anaconda.com
```

Each module has its own `environment.yml`. Start with `-1-mcp-your-environment` and work in order — every module builds on the data and patterns from the one before it.

---

## 🔭 The data

Every module uses the **WASP-18 b phase-folded light curve** from NASA's TESS mission, originally prepared by Daina Bouquin for [polars_demo](https://github.com/dbouquin/polars_demo).

WASP-18 b is a real exoplanet — a hot Jupiter 10× the mass of Jupiter, completing a full orbit every 22.6 hours. TESS measured its host star's brightness dropping by ~1% each time the planet crossed in front of it. Those brightness measurements are our CSV: 1,800 rows, three columns, one recurring signal buried in noise.

It's a good dataset for this curriculum because it has a real anomaly (the transit dip), realistic noise, and enough physical context that the agent's reasoning outputs make intuitive sense. You don't need to know astrophysics — but if you look it up, the numbers check out.

`wasp18b_lightcurve.csv` is bundled in each module directory that uses it.
