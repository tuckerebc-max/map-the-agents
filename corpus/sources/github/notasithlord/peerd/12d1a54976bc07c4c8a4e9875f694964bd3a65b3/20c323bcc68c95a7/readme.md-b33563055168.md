# The first web-native AI agent harness

peerd is the first general-purpose agent runtime built directly on browser primitives: Workers, origins, sandboxing, OPFS, WASM/WASI, WebRTC, WebAuthn, and WebExtensions. It runs completely inside Chrome and Firefox, with your tabs, signed-in sessions, web apps, and local compute.

**While agent platforms are trying to pull the browser into the harness. peerd pulls the harness into the browser.**

For actual inference you can choose a supported hosted model provider, a local model using localhost, or check out preliminary support for local WebGPU models (we're keeping an eye on WebNN as well).

No peerd account, hosted browser, or tool-server connection is required. Current
builds send no product telemetry to peerd.

## Features

- **Works in the browser you already use.** The agent can read and drive your
  tabs, web apps, signed-in sessions, and page content.
- **Builds reusable site clients.** The web actor can learn a site once and use
  that client again on later tasks.
- **Runs code inside browser boundaries.** Scripts, sealed JavaScript Notebooks,
  compiled WASI tools, browser Apps, and Linux WebVMs give the agent local
  compute without access to your host operating system.
- **Delegates to separate actors.** Every page and compute environment gets its
  own keyless actor with tools scoped to that environment.
- **Keeps useful context.** Sessions, memory, skills, goals, review, and
  checkpoints live in the extension.
- **Uses the model you choose.** The live provider inventory is defined in
  [`registry.js`](extension/peerd-provider/registry.js), including BYOK cloud
  adapters and keyless local options.
- **Connects browsers directly.** Preview builds add signed identity,
  browser-to-browser discovery, dwapps, and agent-to-agent communication over
  WebRTC; store packages prune it entirely.

## Why the browser

Local agents can access your whole computer. Remote agents live in someone
else's. The browser is the alternative: local capability behind security
boundaries hardened over three decades.

peerd uses those boundaries. Page work goes to separate actors with only the
tools for that tab or environment. Credentials, network rules, confirmations,
and audit stay with the extension. Its defense-in-depth design assumes unsafe
content will eventually get past a filter.

## Browser support

peerd supports Chromium and Firefox. Firefox runs actors in dedicated workers
and uses visible Notebooks for JavaScript compute. Features that need Chrome's
offscreen document host are removed from Firefox controls and model tools before
use. Firefox preview builds omit dweb until Firefox has a mesh host.

Apps and WebVMs run on Chrome. Apps have no ambient network access. Remote
resources, fetches, WebRTC, forms, and external document navigation are blocked.
External HTTP and HTTPS links require user confirmation.

Concrete browser capability gaps, their upstream issues, and the tests required
to remove each guard are tracked in
[`docs/BROWSER-COMPATIBILITY.md`](docs/BROWSER-COMPATIBILITY.md).

The code is the source of truth for current behavior. Start with
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), then read the relevant module under `extension/`.

## Security model

peerd uses browser isolation, narrow tool exposure, service-worker policy gates,
and explicit egress controls. The main agent delegates environment work to
keyless actors. On Chrome and Firefox, non-orchestrator agent loops run in
separate dedicated worker heaps. If the browser cannot prove that boundary,
the actor request does not run and performs no work on its target.

Network behavior depends on the operation. Model calls, web reads, runtime asset
loads, sandbox traffic, and preview dweb traffic use different scoped paths and
policies. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) and the
[`threat model`](docs/security/THREAT-MODEL.md) for the current boundaries and
known limitations.

## Install

### Chrome from source

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable Developer mode.
4. Choose **Load unpacked** and select the `extension/` directory.

Reload the extension from `chrome://extensions` after source changes.

### Firefox from source

Firefox needs a Firefox-specific package. Do not load the checked-in Chrome
development manifest. Use a Firefox version at or above the minimum declared in
the channel patch under `manifests/`. That floor tracks the document-bound
scripting support used by browser tools.

```sh
bun run package -- --channel=preview --browser=firefox --no-sign
```

Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, choose **Load Temporary Add-on**,
and select `artifacts/peerd-preview-firefox.xpi`. Temporary add-ons must be
loaded again after Firefox restarts. Browser and channel transforms are defined
by the packaging scripts.

### Release packages

See [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/NotASithLord/peerd/releases) for current
artifacts. Store and preview builds differ. Store builds omit the dweb. Preview
builds include it and may enable additional automation features. The packaging
code is the authority for each browser and channel.

## First run

1. Open peerd from the browser toolbar.
2. Create and unlock the local vault. Passphrase unlock is always available.
   Passkey unlock depends on WebAuthn PRF support in the browser and device.
3. Complete the short profile onboarding.
4. Open Settings, then add a provider key or choose a supported local provider.
5. Select a model and start a chat.

Only vault secrets and protected security records are covered by the vault
encryption boundary. Other local extension state follows the storage rules in
the security documentation.

## Architecture

The extension has five main modules. Each module exposes its public API through
its `index.js`.

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| [`peerd-provider`](extension/peerd-provider/) | Model adapters and response formatting |
| [`peerd-egress`](extension/peerd-egress/) | Vault, network policy, denylist, and audit |
| [`peerd-engine`](extension/peerd-engine/) | WebVM, Notebook, App, and headless execution |
| [`peerd-runtime`](extension/peerd-runtime/) | Agent loop, actors, tools, sessions, memory, and permissions |
| [`peerd-distributed`](extension/peerd-distributed/) | Preview-only peer-to-peer network and dwapps |

The extension chassis lives in `background/`, `offscreen/`, `sidepanel/`,
`engine-tabs/`, `permissions/`, `shared/`, and related support directories.
Host placement and the cold-worker rule are documented in
[`docs/EXTENSION-HOSTS.md`](docs/EXTENSION-HOSTS.md).

## Development

The source extension is vanilla JavaScript with ES modules and runs directly
when loaded unpacked. There is no development bundler, transpiler, watcher, or
generated runtime tree. Release packaging uses Bun only on its disposable
staging copy to remove whitespace/comments from authored modules in the static
service-worker and Chrome offscreen cold graphs. It preserves module boundaries,
binding names, lazy imports, and every vendored byte. Pass `--no-minify` to
`bun run package -- ...` when a readable diagnostic artifact is useful.

```sh
bun install
bun run gen:dev
bun test ./tests
bun scripts/cdp/run-inbrowser-tests.mjs
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun run e2e:verify
bun run preflight
```

There are three test surfaces:

- Bun tests for pure logic.
- In-browser tests for extension and browser integration. They run headless
  under Chrome and, sharded, under Gecko against the installed Firefox Store
  package. Each lane executes every test it registers; the totals differ
  slightly because some tests register only where a live service worker
  answers.
- Live Chrome E2E and visual verification for complete flows.

Alongside them, the red-team suite in [`tests/red-team/`](tests/red-team) drives
each adversary from the threat model against the real defense code and records
whether every hostile probe was blocked. Its matrix is
[`docs/security/RED-TEAM-RESULTS.md`](docs/security/RED-TEAM-RESULTS.md).

Each lane publishes its own count as a badge above. The badge JSON under
[`badges/`](badges) is generated by the CI job that ran the lane and then
diffed, so a count on this page is always evidence from a run that happened
rather than a number somebody typed. Regenerate one with `bun run
gen:badge:functional`, `bun run gen:badge:red-team`, `bun run
gen:badge:inbrowser`, `bun run gen:badge:gecko` (needs Firefox and
geckodriver), or `bun run gen:badge:e2e`, and commit the result. `bun run
check:badges` verifies the endpoints are well-formed without launching a
browser.

For UI changes, run `bun run e2e:verify`, inspect
`scripts/cdp/artifacts/result.json`, and inspect the generated screenshots.

Generated files must not be edited by hand. In particular,
`extension/manifest.json` and `extension/shared/channel-config.js` come from the
manifest and packaging sources. CI checks them for drift.

## Dependencies and license

The shipped extension has no npm runtime dependencies. `package.json` declares
none, and packaging never resolves a `node_modules` path into the staged
artifact, so the development-tool tree cannot reach an installed browser.
Third-party runtime code is vendored under `extension/vendor/` instead. Its
source, version, and license live in the adjacent `SOURCE.txt` files, and every
vendored byte is pinned by SHA-256 in
[`extension/vendor/vendor.lock.json`](extension/vendor/vendor.lock.json), which
`bun run check:vendor` verifies in CI and preflight.

Two more supply-chain positions carry their own badges above, both regenerated
by `bun run gen:dev` and drift-checked in CI. Every third-party GitHub Action
runs at a full commit SHA, gated by
[`check:actions`](packaging/check-action-pins.ts): a major tag is a mutable ref
its publisher can move, which would mean arbitrary code in a job holding this
checkout, and in the release workflow, the signing secrets. Newly resolved
dependencies also sit out a quarantine window before they can enter the lock,
set by `minimumReleaseAge` in [`bunfig.toml`](bunfig.toml), alongside a
malware scan on install.
