## 🤖 **Revolutionary Sub-Agent System**

### **The world's first true multi-agent IDE Chat**
*Forget legacy CLI tools. Kade brings true orchestration to your editor.*

Kade introduces a groundbreaking sub-agent architecture that fundamentally changes how you work with AI. **This is NOT your typical CLI-based sub-agent system** - this is the first implementation that brings sub-agents directly into a rich, interactive IDE interface. Instead of one monolithic assistant trying to do everything, you can now **delegate specialized tasks to dedicated agents** with different capabilities, models, and contexts - each with their own dedicated chat interface.

### **How It Works**
- **Infinite Sub-Agent Spawning** - Your main agent can spawn virtually unlimited sub-agents at once (yes, you could theoretically run 10,000+ sub-agents if you have a supercomputer and a very understanding cloud provider bill)
- **Recursive Agent Creation** - Sub-agents can spawn their own sub-agents, creating complex hierarchical task trees
- **Dedicated Chat Interfaces** - Each sub-agent gets its own chat tab in the IDE - you can literally go into your sub-agent's chat and talk directly to them
- **Custom Model Selection** - Choose ANY model from 50+ providers for each sub-agent - mix and match combinations like GPT-5 for architecture, Claude Opus for security, local Llama for documentation
- **Isolated Contexts** - Each sub-agent maintains its own conversation history, file context, and memory
- **Seamless Coordination** - Results flow back to the main agent automatically, or work directly with sub-agents in their dedicated chats
- **Persistent Sub-Agent Sessions** - Sub-agents remember their conversations even when you switch between them

### **Unprecedented Flexibility**
- **50+ Provider Support** - Mix OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models, and 45+ other providers in ANY combination
- **Task-Specific Specialization** - Create a "Testing Agent" with Gemini, "Security Agent" with Claude Opus, "Documentation Agent" with local Llama
- **Direct Sub-Agent Interaction** - Jump into any sub-agent's chat to give them specific instructions or review their work
- **Cross-Agent Learning** - Sub-agents can share insights and coordinate with each other through the main agent
- **Hierarchical Task Trees** - Build complex multi-level agent networks where sub-agents delegate to their own sub-agents
- **Infinite Scalability** - Scale from 2 agents to 200+ agents depending on your project complexity and budget

### **Real-World Use Cases**
```
Main Agent: "I need to refactor this authentication system"
  ↳ Sub-Agent 1 (Security Specialist - Claude Opus): Analyzes vulnerabilities
  ↳ Sub-Agent 2 (Testing Expert - Gemini): Writes comprehensive tests  
  ↳ You: Jump directly into Security Agent's chat to discuss specific threats
  ↳ Main Agent: Integrates all results and implements the refactor
```

**This is how professional development teams actually work** - and now your AI can too, with the freedom to choose the perfect model for each specialized task and interact with each agent directly in their own dedicated environment.

**No other IDE Chat offers this level of multi-agent orchestration and model flexibility.**

## 🧠 **AI Chat Memory**
### *Smart Model Persistence*

**Stop wasting time reconfiguring your workspace.** Kade remembers your preferences so you can stay in the flow.

Kade's intelligent chat memory system ensures that **every conversation remembers which AI model it was using** and automatically restores that selection when you return. No more manually switching between GPT-4, Claude, or your local models every time you open a chat.

### **Key Benefits**
- **Persistent Model Selection** - Each chat window maintains its own AI model choice across sessions
- **Multi-Model Workflows** - Run GPT-5 in one chat, Claude in another, Gemini in a third - simultaneously
- **Seamless Context Switching** - Jump between conversations without losing your model preferences
- **Zero Configuration** - Set it once, it remembers forever

### **Perfect For**
- **Specialized Workflows** - Keep a Claude chat for writing, GPT-5 for coding, local model for quick tasks
- **Model Comparison** - Test the same prompt across different models in parallel windows
- **Team Collaboration** - Share chat sessions with model preferences intact
- **Long-Running Projects** - Return to month-old conversations with the exact same AI setup

**Work smarter, not harder** - let Kade remember the details while you focus on building.

## 🎯 **Universal Tool Calling**

**The death of JSON/XML - one syntax to rule them all:**

While the AI industry defaulted to JSON and XML for tool calling, these legacy formats are deeply flawed. Native JSON function calling suffers from severe cross-provider compatibility issues, strict schema validation failures, and massive token overhead. XML is notoriously janky for LLMs to generate cleanly, often leading to broken tags, whitespace issues, and escaped character nightmares.

Kade solves this by introducing two revolutionary text-based protocols that leverage what AI models are already perfectly trained on: **Markdown** (code blocks) and **Unified** (CLI syntax). By speaking the model's native language, we eliminate syntax errors, drop provider lock-in entirely, and drastically reduce token usage.

**When to use each:**
- **Unified** is tailored for maximum accuracy and precision, offering a concise CLI-like syntax that eliminates ambiguity and ensures reliable tool execution.
- **Markdown** is optimized for speed and rapid development, leveraging familiar code block structure that models can generate quickly and naturally.
- **Native JSON & XML** remain fully supported for legacy integrations and specific provider requirements.

Kade is the only agent that gives you the freedom to choose, supporting all four protocols out of the box.

```bash
# JSON Hell (15+ lines of nested chaos):
{
  "tool_calls": [
    {
      "id": "call_abc123",
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "read",
        "arguments": "{\"path\": \"src/main.ts\", \"lines\": \"1-50\"}"
      }
    }
  ]
}

# Unified Simplicity (1 line):
<<read --path src/main.ts --lines 1-50>>

# Markdown Elegance (Native to AI):
```read
src/main.ts --lines 1-50
```

### **Revolutionary Features**
- **Works with EVERY provider** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Local Models
- **Zero provider lock-in** - Pure text protocol, no native function calling
- **Streaming-safe** - Real-time AI responses handled gracefully
- **Multi-tool batching** - Multiple operations in one turn
- **(N) Limit** - Set a limit on how many tool calls can be used in one turn, set it to unlimited or disable batch tool-calling altogether.
- **Bulletproof reliability** - Escape-safe, error-resilient, debug-friendly

---

## 🧠 **Smart Context Engineering**

**Revolutionary context management that never gets stale:**

- **Turn-by-Turn Refresh** - Files automatically refresh after every edit
- **Smart Edit Tracking** - "Edit #N" progression shows change history
- **Token Optimization** - Context management system only keeps latest versions
- **Persistent Memory** - Restores context on restart with cross-platform support

---

## ⏮️ **Perfect Undo/Redo System**

**VS Code snapshots with zero context poisoning:**

- **Instant Revert** - Undo any AI edit with one click, no token waste
- **Smart Snapshots** - Captures file states before every tool execution
- **Context-Safe** - Works perfectly with context management system (no stale context)
- **A/B Testing** - Toggle between undos/redos to compare approaches
- **Selective Recovery** - Keep 9 good edits, revert just the 1 bad one

### **How It Works**
- **Pre-edit snapshots** of all files before AI tools run
- **One-click undo** restores original content instantly
- **Redo capability** re-applies changes when needed
- **File creation/deletion** handled automatically
- **Zero context corruption** - Context management system keeps everything in sync

**Perfect for:** Fixing bad edits, testing variations, recovering from mistakes without losing thousands of tokens.
