# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes are recorded here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Preserved multiline commands and indentation in formatted Codex log views.

### Removed
- Removed the unused `NodeLogStreamTracker` Python API.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-09

### Changed
- Refactored shared helpers, tightened internal types, and simplified
  provider and workspace lifecycle handling.
- Expanded regression tests and strengthened coverage checks.

### Fixed
- Prevented a dashboard test from leaving a background refresh thread running.
- Restored Homebrew release checks for tapped formulae while preserving
  Homebrew's developer mode setting.
- Preserved crash headers in lengthy release-check failure reports.
- Isolated coverage reporting from pytest during test and release checks.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-07

### Changed
- Refreshed provider model and pricing examples; automatic routing no longer
  suggests fixed token rates.
- Onboarding accepts multiple provider selections and requires at least one.
- Hardened opt-in workspace isolation for safer recovery, retries,
  cancellation, reuse, and cleanup.
- Added recovery for interrupted branch exports.
- Updated dependencies and CI tooling.

### Fixed

- The live DAG view keeps nested branches connected and status icons aligned
  when workflows have long node names.
- Fixed false artifact-drift errors between parallel reviewers.
- Prevented disposable snapshot runs from failing solely because
  drift reporting exceeds its limits.
- Workspace setup now accepts dependency environments that create `.gitignore`
  files inside already ignored directories.
- Workspace invocations with distinct node names such as `a` and `.a` no longer
  collide after name normalization.
- Cancelled runs retain managed workspaces when provider output pipes remain open.
- Worktree creation and retries preserve recorded source despite checkout hooks
  and provider-created hidden index flags.
- Managed node results remain reusable after discarded remediation rounds,
  recovered session exhaustion, and tolerated reviewer failures.
- Large ignored setup dependencies no longer prevent mutable worktree invocations.
- Snapshots preserve recorded source bytes when the project checkout's
  `.gitattributes` changes during a run.
- Fixed cleanup of discarded remediation workspaces and reviewer workspaces.
- Worktrees support project subdirectories without tracked files.
- Recoverable remediation failures no longer trigger false artifact-drift errors
  when reusing a checkout.
- Symlinked Git policy files are rejected before provider execution.

### Upgrade Notes
- Older managed-workspace artifacts missing required validation data
  must be regenerated before resume, duplicate skips, or branch export.
  Rerun affected workflows to regenerate them.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-29

### Changed

- Strict mypy checking now covers the full production package and repository
  typing fixtures.

### Fixed

- Homebrew release pull requests now provide the exact pull request number and
  tested head SHA for manual bottle publication and refresh them after rebases.
- CLI preflight now validates executables behind system `env` wrappers against
  their effective `PATH` and working directory.
- Claude JSON parsing now validates complete streams, handles empty chunks and
  deep payloads, bounds usage capture, and cleans up temporary files on failure.
- Provider processes are now reaped when post-spawn log setup fails.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- Stable releases now open a Homebrew tap pull request automatically; bottle
  publication remains a manual `brew pr-pull` step.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-23

### Breaking Changes

- **Configuration:** Template allowlists now use
  `settings.file_access.allowed_template_paths`; explicit `settings: null` is
  rejected.
- **Workflows:** `preflight` is now a reserved node ID.
- **Custom integrations:** Use JSON Pointers for sensitive options and canonical
  metadata for invoker capabilities; artifact adapters must implement the
  node-based store and terminal-history APIs.
- **Execution-event consumers:** `EventType` is now a public runtime enum, and
  in-memory consumers use enum members. Persisted lowercase NDJSON event values
  remain unchanged.

### Migration

- Move any existing template allowlist from
  `settings.integrations.artifacts.options.allowed_template_paths` to
  `settings.file_access.allowed_template_paths`.
- Remove `settings: null` to use the defaults, or replace it with `settings: {}`.
- Rename any workflow node whose ID is `preflight`, update all references to it,
  and rename its `## preflight` section when present.

### Changed

- Preflight now rejects schema mismatches and inconsistent dependencies,
  policies, artifact locations, runtime references, or workspace lineage.
- Review-loop results now require producer/role/round/size/hash-bound status;
  findings-enabled nodes always publish a findings artifact.
- Terminal manifests now commit only after required post-run work; post-run
  failures fail the run, and stale-lock recovery resumes interrupted publication.
- Workspace cleanup now retains active or unverifiable assets by default and
  requires `--all-projects --yes` for unverifiable cross-project cleanup.

### Fixed

- Allowed provider-prompt file templates to consume result files from prior
  terminal runs while keeping running-run results and other runtime-owned paths
  blocked.
- Prevented nested secrets, forged redaction metadata, unsafe links, path
  substitution, and concurrent writes from leaking or corrupting artifacts.
- Corrected worktree file templates to use the project snapshot before the
  first candidate and candidate lineage thereafter.
- Prevented project-local Python `.venv` environments beside unrelated
  `package.json` files from being misclassified as npm-managed.
- Prevented provider invocations from deadlocking when a provider writes output
  while receiving a large prompt.
- Preserved valid UTF-8 and CRLF line endings across provider-log read boundaries.
- Reported workspace cleanup mutation failures and unavailable installed-version
  metadata as stable CLI errors instead of uncaught exceptions.
- Rejected dangling workspace-cache symlinks during run and cleanup validation.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- Prevented restricted output encodings from crashing CLI output and added a
  native Windows support warning to project initialization.
- Warned when the built-in CLI invoker receives an explicit `model_arg` for a
  built-in provider, where the setting has no effect.
- Prevented stale-lock recovery from starting a same-context replacement while
  a recorded provider CLI process or process group from the interrupted run is
  still active.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-08-06

### Changed

- Added automatic pinned `uv` metadata updates to the existing `ci-tooling` PR
  lane, including synchronized installer checksums and workflow versions.

### Fixed

- Allowed file-backed input nodes to consume result files from prior terminal
  runs while keeping running-run results and other runtime-owned paths blocked.
- Replaced executable network installer pipes in the shell and npm bootstrap
  paths with version-pinned, checksum-verified `uv` release archives.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-08-05

### Changed

- Run summaries now report normalized Codex, Claude, Gemini, and Kilo token
  totals and report counts from durable terminal invocation events, separately
  from the visible-text lower-bound estimate.

### Fixed

- Prevented completion-buffered Gemini JSON invocations from being terminated
  by output-idle timeouts while preserving configured wall-clock limits.
- Kept complete event-log scans out of bounded observer shutdown so large
  successful runs are not reported as observability failures.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Duplicate skip now validates required node and generated-file artifacts and
  can fall back to an older valid matching success.
- Adapter option scopes and observer capabilities are now explicit validated
  extension contracts.

### Fixed

- Redacted secrets across provider and workspace command fields before plans,
  metadata, diagnostics, and observability records are persisted.
- Rejected nonfinite configuration and JSON, unsafe or unbounded workspace
  snapshots, racy process-group discovery, and suppressed artifact durability
  failures.
- Prevented concurrent generated-file publication drift and unrelated
  project-root writes from being attributed to provider invocations.
- Excluded presentation-only and inactive review settings from semantic
  execution identity and made stream-tail retention incrementally bounded.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- Added one automatic retry for transient Codex model-capacity failures.

### Fixed

- Expected workflow failures now exit cleanly with concise diagnostics without
  masking unexpected runtime defects.
- Prevented concurrent reviewer-generated-file snapshots from causing false
  artifact-drift failures.
- Improved release reliability on macOS and during registry propagation.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- Streamlined pre-publish validation and consolidated the maintainer release
  workflow.

### Fixed

- Hardened release publishing against partial registry updates, transient
  verification failures, and credential exposure in errors.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Added optional workflow-provider `reasoning` requests for Codex and Claude
  when using the built-in CLI invoker. Crewplane passes the provider-native
  value through unchanged and records it in dry-run output, preflight plans,
  invocation logs and events, and duplicate-run and resume identity.
- Added preflight validation for reasoning token shape, unsupported invokers or
  provider kinds, and conflicting native reasoning controls in CLI arguments,
  inherited Claude environment state, and explicit Claude settings.
- Added optional `quota_retry_max_wait_seconds` and
  `quota_retry_max_attempts` agent settings to bound quota retries
  independently of ordinary `max_retries`.

### Changed

- Shared-project-root generated-file capture now requires providers to list
  files under `## Generated Files`; Crewplane captures only listed files that
  Git verifies changed during the invocation. Capture fails closed when no
  usable Git baseline is available; managed isolated workspaces retain
  workspace-owned change capture.
- Generated-file snapshot limits and copy failures no longer discard an
  otherwise successful provider result. Crewplane preserves accepted files,
  records bounded rejection metadata, emits capture and finalization warnings,
  copies accepted generated files into the result tree atomically while
  preserving file modes, and omits links for files that could not be
  published.
- Quota retry diagnostics now state that quota attempts are independent of
  `max_retries` and preserve the last distinct non-quota failure when a later
  quota guard or configured ceiling ends the invocation.

### Fixed

- Prevented failed generated-file capture from falling back to live
  project-root file detection during result consolidation.
- Provider failures mentioning `reasoning.effort` are now classified as
  model or configuration errors.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Added global `crewplane --update` and `crewplane -u` options that verify the
  active installation's owning package manager before delegating updates to
  `uv tool`, `pipx`, or Homebrew, then confirm the installed version in a fresh
  process.
- Added safe manual-update guidance for global npm wrappers, direct Python
  installs, editable or direct-source installs, and temporary or project-local
  package environments.

### Changed

- The install script now follows the latest available Crewplane release by
  default so later `uv tool upgrade crewplane` commands are not held to the
  originally installed version. `CREWPLANE_VERSION` remains available for an
  explicit version pin.
- Artifact location output now preserves long filesystem paths without
  inserting terminal-width line breaks.
- Expanded the npm and Homebrew package documentation with the mock-first
  quickstart, workflow overview, provider onboarding, update guidance, and
  package-specific troubleshooting.

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub Release publication on macOS Bash when generated release notes
  do not have a predecessor tag.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- Added global `crewplane --version` and `crewplane -v` options that print the installed package version and exit.
- Added repository contribution and support templates plus automated CI, security, dependency, TestPyPI, and release checks.

### Changed

- Strengthened workspace-aware resume hydration so reusable nodes restore only validated results, findings, generated files, and descriptor-declared lineage artifacts required by downstream worktree and review-loop execution.
- Dry-run resume advisories now list the exact dependency-closed node IDs selected for hydration.
- Strengthened cancellation and cleanup handling for workspace-backed provider runs.
- Refreshed README onboarding, quickstart, workflow, and artifact-layout guidance.
- Clarified supported platforms as Linux, macOS, and WSL; native Windows remains unsupported.
- Expanded same-context run-lock troubleshooting and stale-lock recovery guidance.

### Fixed

- Fixed workspace lineage source verification through result bundles.
- Fixed a Git maintenance race during lineage fetches.
- Hardened runtime-owned Git environment handling so trusted local lineage fetches are not blocked by inherited transport-policy settings.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Added `crewplane onboarding`, an interactive provider handoff that detects
  supported provider CLI names on `PATH`, lets users pick one provider, and
  updates unchanged generated config and workflow defaults for a real-provider
  first run.
- Added onboarding validation, provider setup links, and manual fallback
  snippets so users can recover or complete setup without hand-editing the
  generated YAML from scratch.

### Changed

- Refreshed the mock-first quickstart, provider setup, workflow, observability,
  artifact inspection, workspace isolation, and troubleshooting documentation
  around the new onboarding flow.
- Reorganized documentation images by topic so public guides reference assets
  from clearer locations.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Reserved package-facing installation surfaces for the public `crewplane`
  distribution name.
- Added local release validation targets for Python builds, install smokes,
  `install.sh`, npm packaging, and Homebrew formula checks.
- Added `install.sh` for macOS and WSL/Ubuntu-style Linux installs through
  `uv tool install crewplane`.
- Added npm wrapper package metadata for `npm install -g crewplane`.
- Added Homebrew formula source for the future `crewplaneai/crewplane` tap.
- Added a mock-first quickstart path: new projects now validate and run without
  provider CLIs, API keys, provider accounts, or config edits.
- Added `single-agent-review.task.md` as the default first-run workflow and
  moved the advanced code-review workflow into the example template library.
- Added setup checklist and reproducible support bundle documentation.
- Added a state-aware release tool behind the existing Make targets, including
  `release-prepare`, completed-release verification, partial publish recovery,
  npm `latest` reconciliation, release manifests, and post-publish install
  checks.
- Added `crewplane init` guidance for switching from the mock quickstart to real
  provider CLI workflows.

### Changed

- Python package metadata now publishes as `crewplane` version `0.1.0`.
- Generated config now enables the deterministic `mock` invoker by default and
  keeps real-provider examples commented until users opt in.
- Generated config and setup docs now make the mock-to-CLI switch explicit:
  replace mock invoker options with `options: {}` when using the built-in `cli`
  invoker.
- Generated real-provider examples now use `gpt-5.5` for Codex and
  `claude-sonnet-4.6` for Copilot.
- Relative `{{file:path}}` tokens now resolve from the project root, including
  tokens authored in imported Markdown workflows.
- Provider setup diagnostics now point users to the provider setup guide.
- Provider log files are created before invocation-started telemetry so live
  observability can show a resolvable log path immediately.
- Compact log presentation now expands decoded multiline provider JSON fields
  into display lines.
- DAG graph rendering now preserves fan-in connector continuity across empty
  columns.
- Release Make targets now delegate packaging, smoke, publish, and verification
  behavior to the Python release tool.
- Release metadata synchronization now updates npm package metadata, install
  documentation, `uv.lock`, and Homebrew formula resource pins from the current
  project version.
- Public npm install examples now use the default `crewplane` package instead
  of the alpha dist-tag.
- Codex JSON log presentation now preserves multiline command execution output
  as separate display lines.
- Consolidated result and findings Markdown now uses human-readable section
  headings while preserving provider task IDs in stage artifacts, logs,
  manifests, and review-loop state.

### Fixed

- Fresh `crewplane init && crewplane validate && crewplane run --no-live` can
  complete through the built-in mock invoker without external provider
  commands.
- CLI invoker option validation now points users at the required `options: {}`
  config when stale mock options are left behind.
- Sequential review-loop remediation now stops cleanly after provider session
  context exhaustion when a previous valid candidate exists, discarding any
  recovered executor workspace lineage and continuing with that candidate.
- Fatal artifact drift is now reported as the primary error even when the
  provider invocation also failed.
- Resume locks can now load owner files that lack process start identity
  metadata.

### Known Limitations

- Native Windows is not supported outside WSL.
- Provider CLIs and credentials are installed and managed separately.
- `crewplane` does not sandbox provider CLI execution.
