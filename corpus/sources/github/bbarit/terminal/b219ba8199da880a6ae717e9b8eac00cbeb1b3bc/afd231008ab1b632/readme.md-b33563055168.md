## 🤔 Why BBARIT?

Most "AI IDEs" lock you into **one model** and **one workflow**, hide the AI behind a chat box, and still make you babysit every step. Meanwhile your real work is spread across a dozen terminals, a browser, an editor, a notes app, a Kanban board, and three SSH sessions.

**BBARIT collapses all of that into one native terminal** — and then goes further: it ships **⚡ BBARIT Agent**, its own built-in coding agent that codes, tests and verifies before it's done, puts *every* other AI coding agent in the same window, gives them **real tools** (PTY, git, editors, databases, MCP, a browser), and lets two of them **work as an autonomous team** that designs, builds, tests, reviews, and merges — with a knowledge base that gets smarter every session.

It's not a chat wrapper. It's a **cockpit for shipping with AI**.

| The old way | With BBARIT |
| --- | --- |
| A dozen windows for a dozen repos | **Every codebase on one screen**, switch in a keypress |
| One AI model, take it or leave it | **10 AI CLIs** side by side, swap any time |
| Copy-paste between AI and editor | Agents run in **real terminals** with full tool access |
| You review every diff by hand | A **reviewer AI** reviews continuously; you approve merges |
| Knowledge lost between sessions | **Karpathy Wiki** + self-improving rules compound over time |
| 12 windows for 12 tools | **One window**: terminal · editor · git · notes · kanban · browser |
| Tied to your desk | **Web terminal + Telegram/Discord/Slack** — drive it from your phone |

---

## 👤 Who it's for

- **Solo builders & indie hackers** who want an AI team without hiring one — ship features while you focus on product.
- **Vibe coders** who think out loud to an AI and want it to *actually do the work*, not just suggest.
- **Terminal-native developers** who never want to leave the keyboard, but want modern tools (editors, git UI, search) one keypress away.
- **Knowledge-driven developers** who want a wiki, notes, and design rules that compound across every project.
- **Remote / on-the-go** developers who need to check on long-running agents from a browser or phone.

### 📣 As featured by creators

> ## "99% of AI coding tools are too hard. **Octo Terminal is the 1%.**"

> — **[@aiexplained412](https://www.instagram.com/aiexplained412/)** on Instagram &nbsp;·&nbsp; ▶️ **[Watch the reel](https://www.instagram.com/reels/DVwZsc3gvIx/)**

In the reel, the creator walks through why most AI coding tools are overwhelming — and shows how **Octo Terminal (now BBARIT Terminal)** strips that away: every AI agent and every dev tool in one native terminal, where you just say what you want and the AI does the work. It's the rare AI IDE built to be *easy*, not just powerful.

---

## 🗂️ The core — every codebase on one screen

BBARIT's killer feature is **effortless multi-project, multi-codebase management**. Stop juggling a dozen windows — put every repo in one place and move between them at the speed of thought.

> **The difference from VS Code:** VS Code opens a *separate window per folder*. BBARIT keeps **every codebase — and all of their terminals — on a single screen**, so you manage all your projects and AI agents without ever switching windows.

- **All your repos, side by side.** Open dozens of projects at once; they sit in a list on the left. Jump between them instantly with a shortcut — no re-opening windows, no lost context.
- **Every codebase's terminals, in one place.** Each project's terminals (dev servers, AI agents, logs) stay live and visible together — no window-hopping to check another repo's terminal.
- **Each codebase is fully its own.** Every project keeps its own terminals, AI agents, theme, font, and working directory (local **or SSH**). Switch projects and everything follows.
- **Search across *all* codebases.** `Ctrl/Cmd+P` quick-open searches *every* project at once — not just the current one — and it's instant.
- **Split, stack & monitor.** Run a dev server in one pane, Claude in another, tests in a third; rearrange freely. **Monitor mode** gives you a CCTV-style overview of every service across every codebase, live.
- **Drag, pin, restyle.** Reorder projects by drag-and-drop, pin favorites to the top, give each its own look.

> **One window. Every codebase. Zero context-switching tax.**

---

## ✨ Headline — ⚡ BBARIT Agent — the built-in coding agent

**BBARIT Agent (빠릿에이전트)** is BBARIT's own coding agent — not a chat box bolted onto an editor, but a real agent with real tools that reads, edits, runs and verifies your code, and won't call a job done until the tests actually pass.

- **✅ It verifies its own work.** Change code but run nothing? The agent refuses to finish — it runs your tests or build, reads the failures, and fixes them. Judged by the exit code, not by the model's word.
- **🔧 Safe, surgical edits.** Line-anchored editing lands changes on the exact line even as code shifts. It must read a file before editing it, and blind edits to files that changed on disk are blocked.
- **⏪ Auto-rollback & guardrails.** Every file change is snapshotted — roll back anytime. Catastrophic commands (`rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, raw disk writes) are blocked, and untrusted projects can't be changed silently.
- **🧭 Understands your codebase.** BM25 + semantic code search, a dependency & impact graph (*what breaks if I change this?*), and a task planner — so it edits with context, not guesswork.
- **🔌 Any model you want.** OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, AWS Bedrock, Azure — 37 providers and 1,000+ models built in. Log in with your ChatGPT or Claude subscription, or run Ollama fully local.
- **👥 297 experts + parallel subagents.** Hand a task to one of 297 built-in expert personas, or fan work out to several subagents at once. Extend it with MCP servers and lifecycle hooks.

> **Talk to it in the terminal, in the chat panel, or from your phone — it codes, verifies, and rolls back safely.**

## 🦌 Broker Agent — your autonomous AI dev/review team

Press one button (🦌) and BBARIT opens **two real terminals** — a **Developer** (e.g. Claude) and a **Reviewer** (e.g. Codex) — and runs a transparent **mechanical broker** between them that mediates the entire dev↔review loop. You give the goal; the pair designs, builds, tests, reviews, and merges. You approve.

### The loop, step by step

1. **You give the developer a task** in plain language — just like talking to Claude normally.
2. **The developer implements and tests its own work**, keeps a project wiki, and appends a one-line `DONE:` to a feed file when a unit is genuinely finished.
3. **The broker sees that signal**, reads the `git diff`, and **judges it mechanically** — source-growth vs a baseline SHA, code-graph blast radius, sensitivity patterns (secrets/auth/destructive/SQL/payment), and requirements progress. *No extra LLM calls, zero token cost.*
4. **The broker hands the change to the reviewer** — and delivers the diff content **inline**, so the reviewer doesn't burn tokens re-opening files.
5. **The reviewer reviews** (Linus-style: direct, specific) and replies `APPROVED` or `REWORK: …`. It **owns the rework loop**, re-issuing instructions until the developer actually fixes it.
6. **On `APPROVED`, the broker auto-commits and merges** the harness's isolated branch — only if git checks pass. A failed merge is **escalated to you**, never forced.

### What makes it genuinely different

- **🔍 Transparent, not a black box.** Two *visible* terminals. Every message, diff, and decision is tracked in **git + the Karpathy Wiki** — reproducible and auditable, never screen-scraped.
- **🧠 Mechanical broker brain (LLM = 0).** The mediation logic is pure code — growth, impact, sensitivity, RTM — so coordination is free, fast, and deterministic.
- **🌳 Worktree isolation.** Each harness runs on its own git branch + worktree (`.octo-tmp/broker-wt-…`). It **never touches your working tree**, so you can run **several features in parallel** and merge them later.
- **🧩 Multi-harness manager.** A full-screen workspace with a **project → harness tree**: spin up many dev/review pairs across projects, switch between them, each with its **own live status window** (Working / Done), broker log, and two terminals.
- **🔄 Hot-swap models mid-session.** Change the developer or reviewer agent any time; the new agent reads the wiki + git and **continues** the in-progress work — no restart from scratch.
- **💾 Session persistence.** Harnesses are saved and **auto-restore on reopen/restart**, continuing exactly where they left off — including queued auto-merges.
- **📋 Requirements traceability (RTM).** Every requirement is a tracked row, **verified against real code + real tests** before anything is called done.
- **📈 Self-improving.** Recurring review findings are promoted into **permanent design rules**, so the same mistakes get caught earlier next time.
- **🪜 Tiered knowledge.** Project wiki → global wiki → *other projects' code* when stuck — learning *your* patterns and conventions.
- **🛑 You stay in control.** Agents propose; **merge & deploy require your approval.** Always.

> **One click → a Claude+Codex pair that designs, builds, tests, reviews, and records — while you just give the goal.**

---

## 🖥️ Terminal & editor

**A real terminal — not a web emulation.** Built on `portable-pty` + Rust, rendered with WebGL.

- **Multi-project, multi-terminal** — open dozens of projects, each with its own terminals, themes, and fonts. Switch instantly with `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift`. **`Ctrl/Cmd+P` quick-open searches across *all* projects** and is blazing fast.
- **Split panes** — resizable tree layout, tabs, horizontal/vertical/grid/tile — run an agent in one pane, your dev server in another, a reviewer in a third.
- **Monitor mode** — a CCTV-style overview of every service across every project, with live activity dots.
- **WebGL rendering** — GPU-accelerated, Unicode 11, ligatures, true color, 75+ themes, custom coding fonts.
- **First-class CJK / IME** — Korean / Chinese / Japanese composition done right, with **UTF-8 shells out of the box**.
- **Copy that just works** — copy-on-select, right-click copy/paste, search, click-to-open links.

**Every file viewer & editor built in** — you never leave the app to open a file:

| **Diagrams** | Mermaid live preview |

---

## 📚 Knowledge that compounds

- **Karpathy Wiki** — a structured, **two-tier (project + global)** knowledge base your agents read first and write back to. Kept small with per-topic files and **auto-archiving**, so it never bloats into one giant document.
- **Notes / knowledge graph** — a markdown vault with **wikilinks, backlinks, tags**, and an Obsidian-style **graph view** (4 layouts, minimap, glow). AI can auto-generate and auto-organize notes.
- **Skills library** — thousands of curated skills, **GitHub skill-pack import**, parameterized templates with `{{variables}}`, and one-click run. Includes the built-in **Karpathy guidelines** pack (think-before-coding, simplicity, surgical changes, goal-driven).
- **Prompt library** — save, favorite, and reuse your best prompts across projects.
- **Self-improving harness** — background review distills recurring lessons into durable rules.

---

## 🛠️ Developer tools

- **Git panel** — status, diff, history, branches, stashes, tags, **worktrees**, merge; one-click worktree for features or harnesses.
- **Code search** — hybrid **BM25 + semantic** over your source, plus a **code-graph** (`defs` / `callers` / `impact` with risk scoring) — the same engine the broker uses to judge change blast-radius.
- **Tasks** — global **Kanban** (6 columns, 5 priorities), **Todo**, and a **Gantt planner** that links tasks to projects/terminals. **Imports GitHub & Linear issues** → send a card to a terminal so the agent fixes it (one-click support automation).
- **MCP** — connect Model Context Protocol servers (form or JSON), browse/invoke tools, with a built-in **browser MCP bridge** and **100+ curated presets** (Gmail, Slack, Linear, Notion, GitHub, Postgres…).
- **Database** — MySQL & PostgreSQL: connection test, schema browser, query runner; credentials stored locally.
- **PM2 / process monitoring** — real-time CPU/memory gauges, log streaming, and **AI anomaly detection** (via Ollama) for SSH servers.
- **AutoResearch** — a Karpathy-style autonomous ML-experiment panel.

---

## 🔌 Remote & web access

- **🌐 Web Terminal** — open a **full terminal, file explorer, and editor from any browser** (phone or desktop) over a **Cloudflare tunnel**. Real PTY, not an HTTP shim.
- **📱 Telegram · Discord · Slack** — mirror terminal I/O and drive sessions remotely from your phone (passwords auto-masked, per-project channels).
- **🔑 SSH projects** — file tree, editor, and terminal work **transparently over SSH** — a remote project behaves exactly like a local one.
- **🔗 GitHub · Linear Hub** — a unified, color-coded feed of all your issues, per-project.

---

## 🌐 Built-in browser + automation

A real Chromium browser **inside** the app, wired to your agents:

- **Pick** — click any element → CSS selector, XPath, computed styles → straight into an AI prompt.
- **Live** — real-time console errors & page changes, auto-notified.
- **Page → Markdown** — Readability + Turndown to convert any page to clean Markdown (and copy it).
- **AI Fix** — auto-diagnose console errors + suggest fixes.
- **Test** — auto-generate test cases from the live page.
- **MCP bridge** — your Claude/Codex CLI can `navigate`, `screenshot`, `get_page_text`, `javascript_eval`, manage tabs, read console/network — all through the built-in browser.

## ❓ FAQ

- **What is ⚡ BBARIT Agent?** BBARIT's own built-in coding agent (빠릿에이전트). It reads, edits, runs and **verifies** your code — it runs your tests or build, reads the failures, and fixes them before it's allowed to finish. Every file change is snapshotted for instant rollback.
- **Which models can BBARIT Agent use?** 37 providers and 1,000+ models — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, AWS Bedrock, Azure and more. Log in with your **ChatGPT or Claude subscription**, use API keys, or run **Ollama fully local**.
- **Do I need an API key?** No — for external CLIs you use the AI **CLIs** you already have installed; BBARIT runs them in real terminals. For BBARIT Agent, a subscription login or a local Ollama model works too.
- **Which agents can the Broker Agent pair use?** Any installed CLI — Claude, Codex, Gemini, Kimi, Qwen, Ollama, and more — and you can **hot-swap either role mid-session**.
- **Will it touch my repo without asking?** No — the Broker Agent works in an **isolated git worktree** and never merges or deploys without your approval. It only initializes git (with a notice) when needed for review.
- **My project has no git — does review still work?** Yes — the broker offers to initialize git so diff-based review works, and tells you before it does.
- **Can I run more than one AI pair at once?** Yes — the multi-harness manager runs several dev/review pairs in parallel, each worktree-isolated and individually monitored.
- **Does it work over SSH / from my phone?** Yes — SSH projects work like local ones, and the **Web Terminal** + Telegram/Discord/Slack mirroring let you drive sessions from a browser or phone.
- **Is my code private with local models?** Run **Ollama** for fully local, on-device inference — nothing leaves your machine.
- **Is this the same as Octo Terminal?** Yes — BBARIT Terminal is the **evolution of Octo Terminal**, rebuilt and renamed.
