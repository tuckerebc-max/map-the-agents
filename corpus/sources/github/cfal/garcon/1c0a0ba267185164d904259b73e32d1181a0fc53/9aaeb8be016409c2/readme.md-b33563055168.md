Garcon runs agents, terminals, files, Git, and pull request commands on the host under your account, using the agent logins and model endpoints you configure.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cfal/garcon.git
cd garcon
bun run setup
bun run start
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. On first launch, create an account at `/setup`, then connect agents and API providers in Settings. Authentication is enabled by default.

Requirements:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/), `git`, and a modern browser.
- At least one working coding agent or API provider.
- Optional pull request support: an authenticated GitHub CLI on the selected executor, with support for `gh auth status --json hosts` and `gh api --paginate --slurp`.

Garcon publishes an official multi-platform container image for every commit on `main`:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/cfal/garcon:main
```

The [Docker guide](docs/docker.md) covers running the published image, building the current checkout, image tags, volumes, agent login, Git, SSH, and toolchains.

## Why Garcon

One agent chat is easy. The hard part begins when several agents are running, one needs approval, another has finished, and their changes still need to be understood and shipped.

Garcon keeps that development loop coherent:

- **Orchestrate visually.** Tile up to four resizable windows, move local tabs between them, organize live chats on durable canvases, track work on tag-driven boards, and inspect fork, handoff, and delegation lineage in Chat Map.
- **Stay in control of every turn.** Queue and reorder instructions, steer active work, approve tools, answer agent questions, pause the queue, interrupt, or stop without losing the transcript.
- **Coordinate agents visibly.** Exchange provenance-labeled messages between chats, launch delegated children, receive their final results, and keep parentage auditable instead of hiding it in a side channel.
- **Track durable work.** Create workspace tickets in a list or status board, assign and claim work, discuss progress, and retain attributed change history across chat deletion and server restarts.
- **Review the real change.** Browse and edit files, run terminals, inspect reasoning and tool calls, review diffs, then stage individual lines, hunks, files, or folders before committing and pushing.
- **Find and reuse context.** Search chat metadata and indexed transcripts, save filters, tag, pin, archive, export Markdown or XML, build bounded handoffs, share snapshots, and schedule prompts.
- **Work from any screen.** Use the responsive workspace on desktop or phone and choose Classic, Phosphor, or colorblind-aware themes in light or dark mode.

## Works With

**Coding agents:** Claude Code, Codex, Cursor Agent, OpenCode, Amp, Factory Droid, and Pi.

**Direct model access:** Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Responses, and OpenAI Chat Completions compatible endpoints.

**Provider presets and discovery:** Ollama, OpenRouter, Gemini, Fireworks, Together, Alibaba Cloud, Z.AI, and custom OpenAI or Anthropic compatible services.

Use an existing agent login or subscription where its CLI supports one, or configure API providers in Settings. Each chat keeps its own agent, model, effort, permission, provider, endpoint, and preamble settings where supported.

Claude Code requires version 2.1.238 or newer. A model ending in `[Nk]` sets a per-chat auto-compaction window without a per-model configuration table. For example, `gpt-6-astra[922k]` launches Claude with `--model gpt-6-astra[1m] --autocompact 922k`; Claude strips `[1m]` before calling the provider. `N` must be an integer from 100 through 1000 (thousands of tokens). The suffix should reflect the model's supported **input** limit, not input plus output; Claude reserves additional compaction headroom below it. Garcon retains the annotated model in the chat configuration. Custom endpoints must include that exact annotated ID in their model catalog.

Existing `[1m]` names keep Claude's native compaction policy. An explicit `[Nk]` annotation overrides `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` for that child process only; other environment and Claude settings remain in effect. Changes between numeric caps use a verified runtime control between turns without restarting. The control updates the child process's environment, which may also be inherited by its tools. Adding or removing a numeric cap, changing other startup-only options, or failing runtime verification resumes the same native session in a new process. Initial launches and one-shot queries retain `--autocompact`. See [Claude's context-window documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config#context-window-and-auto-compaction).

## Automate And Delegate

The CLI drives ordinary visible Garcon chats through an already-running server. It covers live catalog discovery, synchronous or detached starts and resumes, steering, exact-turn waiting, status and fenced permission decisions, chat metadata, transcript search and bounded reads, export, handoff, and stop controls.

```bash
# Start detached work with explicit lineage.
bun cli/main.ts --runtime controller start-async --cwd /path/to/project \
  --parent 1785337200123456 --agent codex --model gpt-5.4 \
  --permissions acceptEdits "Implement the validation and run focused tests."

# Find prior work, then read exact context around a durable transcript row.
bun cli/main.ts --runtime controller search '"version bump"' --json
bun cli/main.ts --runtime controller read 1785337200123456 84 -B 5 -A 5

# Inspect or steer work without creating a hidden session.
bun cli/main.ts --runtime controller status 1785337200123456 --messages 20
bun cli/main.ts --runtime controller resume-async 1785337200123456 \
  --allow-steer "Address the review finding and rerun the tests."
```

See the [CLI and server guide](docs/cli.md) for the full command and connection reference. `bun run build-exe` produces standalone Linux x64 and macOS arm64 executables.

The companion [cfal/garcon-skills](https://github.com/cfal/garcon-skills) package exposes the same control plane to Claude, Codex, Pi, and other skill-aware agents:

- `garcon-captain` searches, reads, organizes, monitors, and coordinates chats; `garcon-agent` starts or resumes a selected agent through the CLI.
- `garcon-task` starts, resumes, stops, or removes delegated child chats and returns their final output; `garcon-message` exchanges in-band messages with up to 16 existing chats.
- `garcon-schedule` creates future or recurring prompts for the current chat; `garcon-amp` equips a parent with fresh Oracle, Finder, Librarian, and Reporter specialists.
- `garcon-ticket` manages durable workspace tickets from a chat.

Garcon also installs six editable preambles: a Captain control room for CLI-based chat discovery and coordination, plus the in-chat protocols for chat identity, inter-chat messages, delegated agents, scheduled prompts, and tickets. They are excluded from automatic defaults but can be selected per chat. Fresh workspaces receive all six; existing workspaces receive only missing entries on startup, without overwriting edits or restoring deleted entries. The companion skills provide deeper workflows and Garcon-Amp orchestration.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cfal/garcon-skills.git
cd garcon-skills
./link.sh
```

The installer links the skills for Claude, Codex, Pi, and other compatible agents. Messages, delegated work, results, and lineage remain visible in Garcon.

## Tickets

Open **Tickets** from a workspace window's add menu. Create work without starting a chat, switch between list and board, and filter by project, status, priority, label, assignee, or readiness. The detail pane shares properties, comments, relationships, and activity across both layouts. On narrow screens, Back returns to the collection. Status menus provide a keyboard equivalent to board dragging; closing asks for Done or Canceled. Moving a card changes only its status, not its assignee.

**New chat from ticket** opens the normal New Chat dialog with an editable ticket prompt. **Create & open chat** first saves a new ticket, then opens that dialog. Choose the executor, directory or worktree, model, permissions, and preambles before starting. Opening or starting the chat does not assign the ticket or change its status; the agent can use ticket tools to claim and update it. Cancelling New Chat leaves the ticket unchanged.

Settings > Automation > **Ticket chat prompt** configures the template with `{{ticket_id}}`, `{{ticket_title}}`, `{{ticket_project}}`, and `{{ticket_description}}`. Only `{{ticket_id}}` is required; the other fields can be omitted, reordered, or repeated. Project is a label, not the chat's execution directory. Empty templates restore the default. Templates are limited to 32,000 characters and expanded prompts to 256,000 characters; variables inside ticket content are not expanded again. Settings use `ui.ticketChat.customPrompt`, with no separate model or executor preference.

Project is an editable grouping string, not a directory permission. Enter any name, use an exact project filter, or accept the default from the selected chat's repository/folder. If Git fails or cannot identify the primary checkout, the default is the chat's project path. Tickets are also available through the [CLI](docs/cli.md#tickets) and the `garcon-ticket-*` agent commands. Agent command settings do not disable human ticket management.

Drafts stay in the current browser tab's recovery storage when available. Save and comment shortcuts use Cmd/Ctrl+Enter; Enter in a multiline field inserts a newline. After an uncertain save, **Retry same request** confirms the original operation and refreshes current server values. Conflicts preserve local text for review. Recovery is not a backup: copy text before closing if storage reports a warning. Different accounts and replacement ticket databases never inherit a draft's write authority.

Comment removal retains previous text in activity history; it is not redaction. Tickets live in the workspace's `tickets.sqlite`, independently of chats and transcripts. Back up a live store through SQLite's backup API or `VACUUM INTO`, not by copying only the main file while WAL writes are active. A damaged or unknown-schema store is left unavailable for explicit recovery, never rebuilt from transcripts.

Activity's **Open source** opens the originating chat at the visible ticket-command result, including older rows outside the loaded transcript. If the transcript was reloaded or the exact result is missing, it opens the chat with a notification instead. Deleted chats cannot be opened. Source addresses remain immutable; navigation never substitutes a row from a replacement transcript.

## Remote Executors

Garcon can run agents, files, Git, and terminals on Local and on trusted remote
workers. Either side may initiate the connection; both directions use an
authenticated Noise-encrypted WebSocket. Worker listeners support native TLS
or explicit `--no-tls` behind a protected TLS proxy.

Add a target in the Executors dialog. Dialing workers receive their full
connection credential through `GARCON_CONTROLLER_URL`, never `--connect`.
Configure the controller's external address with `--public-url` or
`GARCON_PUBLIC_URL`; proxy deployments should not rely on Host fallback.
Workspace-wide CLI access is a separate default-off grant.

See [executor deployment and onboarding](docs/cli.md#executor-connections) and
[executor trust, credentials, and revocation](docs/security.md#executor-trust-boundary)
before enabling remote access.

## Trusted Local Use

To disable authentication for a trusted single-user environment:

```bash
bun run start --disable-auth
# or
GARCON_DISABLE_AUTH=true bun run start
```

Do not expose an unauthenticated instance to an untrusted network. Garcon does not sandbox agents or their commands. Review the [security notes](docs/security.md) before exposing it beyond a trusted network.
