# Mini-Kode

An educational AI coding assistant project that helps you understand and hack modern AI coding assistant systems.

## 🌟 Why Mini-Kode?

![Demo](./demo.png)

Mini-Kode is an **educational project** designed to help developers understand modern Coding Agent architecture. We strike the perfect balance between overly complex open-source projects and simplistic demo examples, offering a complete yet manageable implementation (14K lines of production code) with:

- **📚 Education-First Design** - Clean architecture built on OpenAI SDK with thoughtful type design and comprehensive comments
- **🛠️ Complete Tool System** - Unified interface with comprehensive tools for file operations, search, and command execution
- **🔌 MCP Integration** - Connect to external MCP servers for extended functionality
- **⚙️ Multi-LLM Support** - Compatible with OpenAI APIs, including GLM, DeepSeek, and other mainstream models
- **🤖 Agent Loop** - Complete LLM workflow with streaming responses and human-in-the-loop permission approval
- **🎨 Modern UI** - React/Ink-based terminal interface with theme support

## 🚀 Quick Start (Install & Use)

### Install Globally

```bash
npm install -g mini-kode
```

### Set Up API Key

**DeepSeek** (tested and verified):

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-deepseek-api-key"
```

**Or use GLM (智谱AI)** (tested and verified):

```bash
export GLM_API_KEY="your-glm-api-key"
```

**Or use OpenAI compatible API**:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
# or
MINIKODE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
MINIKODE_BASE_URL="https://your-api-provider.com/v1"
MINIKODE_MODEL="your-model-name"
```

### Run Mini-Kode

```bash
# Interactive mode (launch UI)
mini-kode

# Non-interactive mode (direct execution)
mini-kode "help me fix the bug in auth.ts"
```

## 🔧 Development Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Bun**
- **pnpm**

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Development mode with file watching

## 🧠 Project Memory

Mini-Kode automatically uses `AGENTS.md` file in your project root to provide context-aware assistance:

- **Automatic Context**: System reads `AGENTS.md` to understand your project
- **Customizable**: Edit `AGENTS.md` to include project-specific information
- **Persistent Memory**: Maintains project context across sessions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** - Static type checking
- **pnpm** - Package management
- **Ink** - React terminal UI
- **OpenAI SDK** - LLM integration (supports DeepSeek/OpenAI/compatible APIs)
- **Vitest** - Testing framework
- **Zod** - Runtime type validation
- **Commander** - CLI framework

## 🚧 Future Plans

1. **Session Persistence and Resume** - Save and restore agent sessions
2. **LLM Built-in Tool Integration** - Support for LLM's native tool capabilities (note: DeepSeek currently doesn't support web search tools)
3. **Image Input Support** - Process and analyze image inputs
4. **Sub Agents Functionality** - Hierarchical agent delegation
5. **Reasoning Model Support** - Integration with reasoning-focused models
6. **Tool Call Message Streaming** - Real-time streaming of tool execution
7. **Context Caching** - Smart caching of conversation context to reduce token usage
