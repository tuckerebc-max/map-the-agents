## About

AdaL is an AI coding agent that runs in your terminal, created by [SylphAI](https://adalagent.ai/) and named after Ada Lovelace, the world's first programmer. It works with Claude, GPT, Gemini, GLM, Kimi, DeepSeek, MiniMax, and local models.

AdaL CLI is a terminal-native platform for orchestrating AI agents, models, and tools into autonomous, end-to-end workflows with persistent memory and human alignment.

**This repository is the community home for AdaL CLI** — report issues, share what you build, and contribute skills.

### Hackathon presentation

Open the [`@skills:` system card](https://sylphai-inc.github.io/adal-cli/hackathon/) for a presentation-ready overview of reusable agent knowledge, skill delivery, and the two main workflows.

Presenter notes and local preview instructions are in [`hackathon/README.md`](hackathon/README.md).

### Install AdaL CLI

Native install is recommended: it manages AdaL's runtime and updates consistently across platforms.

**macOS, Linux, WSL:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://adal.sylph.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
irm https://adal.sylph.ai/install/windows | iex
```

**Windows CMD:**

```bat
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://adal.sylph.ai/install/windows | iex"
```

> If `irm` is not recognized, you are in CMD rather than PowerShell — use the Windows CMD command above, or open PowerShell.

Then go to your working directory and run:

```bash
adal
```

First run opens the browser for authentication. See the [Quickstart](https://docs.sylph.ai/getting-started/quickstart) for details.

## The CLI

**Start where developers move fastest.** AdaL CLI brings agentic work into the terminal — with model switching, reviewable tool use, session memory, and IDE handoff.

- **Terminal-native** — command discovery, tool confirmations, streaming work, and clean recovery paths.
- **Review-first** — tool calls, file edits, diffs, and plans stay visible, so you understand the work before signing off.
- **Model freedom** — switch between Claude, Gemini, GLM, Kimi, DeepSeek, MiniMax and more from a fast command palette.
- **CLI → IDE handoff** — open the same session in AdaL's agentic IDE when a task needs files, terminal, and canvas together.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/model` | Choose the best model for the job |
| `/ide` | Open the current session in the agentic IDE |
| `/resume` | Return to previous work with context intact |
| `/stats` | Inspect session health, model, and usage |

More on the [CLI product page](https://adalagent.ai/product/cli).

## 📝 Contributing

Skills are the best way to contribute. A skill is a markdown file that teaches the agent a repeatable workflow — no need to touch the CLI internals.

Skills live in [SylphAI-Inc/skills](https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/skills) (MIT) and install straight into the CLI:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add SylphAI-Inc/skills
/plugin install core-skills@adal-agent-skills
/skills   # see what you have
```

### Contribute a Skill

1. **Fork** [SylphAI-Inc/skills](https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/skills)
2. **Create** your skill at `skills/<your-skill-name>/SKILL.md`
3. **Register** it in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
4. **Open a pull request**

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description for the skills list
author: your-username
version: 1.0.0

# Skill Title

## When to Use

Describe the trigger conditions.

## Instructions

Step-by-step guidance for the agent.
```

New to it? Install [create-skill](https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/skills/blob/main/skills/create-skill/SKILL.md) and let AdaL scaffold one with you. For a larger example, see [swe-cli-skills](https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/swe-cli-skills).

### Share Your Use Case

The best way to share a workflow is to ship it as a skill — then anyone can install it in one command. If you have a process that works, package it up and send it over.
