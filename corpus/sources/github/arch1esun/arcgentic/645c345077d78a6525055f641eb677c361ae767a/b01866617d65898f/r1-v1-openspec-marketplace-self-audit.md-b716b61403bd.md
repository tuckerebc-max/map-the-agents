# R1-v1-openspec-marketplace — Developer Self-Audit Handoff

**Round**: R1-v1-openspec-marketplace
**Session identity**: developer only
**Final dev-body implementation anchor**: `bfa7a95`
**Self-audit handoff commit**: recorded in `.agentic-rounds/state.yaml`
**External audit status**: ready, not written by this session

## § 1. Scope Completed

Implemented the first V1 source/spec slice from the handoff:

- `session-mode` classifier and identity prompt generation.
- Synthetic fixtures for marketplace, OpenSpec, English agency, and Chinese agency shapes.
- `agency-roster`, `source-intake`, `capability-registry`, and `spec-governance` modules.
- `v1-release-readiness` version-surface gate.
- CLI commands for all V1 seams.
- Skill and README surfaces for the new commands.

## § 2. Scope Boundaries

- No Moirai files were touched.
- No OpenSpec npm dependency was added.
- No external marketplace plugin code was vendored.
- No paid API, background process, or automatic third-party install was introduced.
- This session did not write an external audit verdict.

## § 3. Developer Commit Chain

| Phase | Commit | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `d02bdce` | session-mode classifier and tests |
| 2 | `ba06c02` | source/spec/capability/agency parser modules and fixtures |
| 3 | `bfa7a95` | CLI wiring and v1-release-readiness gate |
| 4 | `<handoff-commit>` | skills, README surfaces, and this self-audit handoff |

## § 4. Local Verification

Quality gates run after implementation and surface updates:

- `cd toolkit && pytest --tb=short -q` -> 301 tests passed.
- `cd toolkit && mypy --strict src/ tests/` -> clean.
- `cd toolkit && ruff check .` -> clean.
- `python3 ~/.codex/skills/.system/plugin-creator/scripts/validate_plugin.py /Users/archiesun/plugins/arcgentic` -> passed.

## § 5. Known Degradation

Adapter dispatch transport was not used for this developer session. The round continued as
verified local execution because the user explicitly opened this session as developer-only
multi-session handoff. No single-session auto-audit success is claimed.

## § 6. External Auditor Notes

The external auditor should independently verify:

- `current_round.dev_commits` in `.agentic-rounds/state.yaml`.
- Every commit listed in § 3.
- The commands in § 7.
- That no external audit verdict exists from this developer session.

## § 7. Mechanical audit facts

| # | Command | Expected | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `bash -lc 'test "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" = "$(python3 -c "import yaml;print(yaml.safe_load(open(\".agentic-rounds/state.yaml\"))[\"current_round\"][\"self_audit_doc\"][\"commit\"])" )" && echo true'` | `true` | HEAD matches state self-audit handoff commit |
| 2 | `cd toolkit && pytest --tb=short -q >/tmp/arcgentic-r1-pytest.out && grep -o '[0-9][0-9]* passed' /tmp/arcgentic-r1-pytest.out \| tail -1 \| awk '{print $1}'` | `301` | pytest count |
| 3 | `cd toolkit && mypy --strict src/ tests/ \| tail -1` | `Success: no issues found in 61 source files` | strict typing gate |
| 4 | `cd toolkit && ruff check .` | `All checks passed!` | lint gate |
| 5 | `bash -lc 'python3 ~/.codex/skills/.system/plugin-creator/scripts/validate_plugin.py /Users/archiesun/plugins/arcgentic'` | `Plugin validation passed: /Users/archiesun/Desktop/Arc Studio/arcgentic` | plugin validator |

| 7 | `bash -lc 'git grep -n "@openspec\\|openspec" -- toolkit/pyproject.toml plugin.json .claude-plugin .codex-plugin 2>/dev/null \| wc -l \| tr -d " "'` | `0` | no OpenSpec package dependency in manifest surfaces |
| 8 | `git diff --name-only HEAD~4..HEAD \| rg 'Moirai\|/Moirai' \| wc -l \| tr -d ' '` | `0` | no Moirai path modified |
| 9 | `cd toolkit && python -m arcgentic.cli session-mode recommend --round R1-v1-openspec-marketplace --handoff ../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-02-R1-v1-openspec-marketplace-handoff.md --dispatch-unavailable \| python -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["recommended_mode"])'` | `multi-session` | classifier recommendation for this round |

## § 8. Stop Condition

Developer work is ready to stop after this handoff commit is created, dev commits are
recorded in state, and state transitions to `awaiting_audit`.
