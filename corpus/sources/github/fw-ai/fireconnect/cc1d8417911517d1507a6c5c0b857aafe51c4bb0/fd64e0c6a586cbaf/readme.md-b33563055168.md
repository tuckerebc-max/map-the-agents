[![License: Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/fw-ai/fireconnect/blob/main/LICENSE)

> Use [Fireworks AI](https://fireworks.ai) models in Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Pi, Cursor, VS Code, and DeepSeek Harness.

One CLI points your existing AI coding tools at Fireworks. `on` rewrites the tool's own config,
`off` restores your original file **byte-for-byte** — no proxy to run, no wrapper to launch.

## Quick start

**1. Install**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fw-ai/fireconnect/main/install.sh | bash
```

**2. Sign in**

```bash
fireconnect login        # browser sign-in, or paste a fw_… / fpk_… key
```

**3. Connect a harness**

```bash
fireconnect claude       # first run opens the model mapping wizard
```

```text
✓ Claude Code → Fireworks
Model mapping
  Fable     → glm-flash-latest
  Opus      → firerouter
  Sonnet    → deepseek-pro-latest
  Haiku     → deepseek-flash-latest
  Subagents → deepseek-flash-latest

✓ Web search → fireworks-websearch (installed)

Restart Claude Code to use the new setup.
```

**4. Restart the tool, then verify**

```bash
fireconnect claude status
```

```text
Claude Code
Connection: on
Provider: Fireworks
Auth: custom header in settings.json

Model mapping:
  main     -> firerouter
```

`claude status` lists only overrides — unpinned native slots and slots still on the
default Fireworks mapping are omitted. With the recommended defaults, the mapping
section may be empty until you pin a slot.

Swap `claude` for any harness: `opencode`, `codex`, `pi`, `cursor`, `vscode`, `deepseek`.
Run `fireconnect help` or `fireconnect <harness> help` for every option.

### Install notes

- Requires **bash** and **Node.js 18+**. Missing or too old Node: installed via Homebrew on macOS, otherwise the
  installer prints nvm / nodejs.org / NodeSource instructions.
- Clones the CLI to `~/.fireconnect/cli`, installs the launcher into `~/.local/bin`, and adds it
  to your shell `PATH`.
- Runs the same finalize as `fireconnect upgrade` (reprobe secret storage; rebake enabled harness
  keys and the Claude websearch MCP Bearer token).
- Does **not** sign you in or touch harness settings — that's steps 2 and 3.

**Windows:** run from Git Bash with the same command above. Piping through PowerShell corrupts line endings
(`set: pipefail\r: invalid option name`).

**From an SSH checkout:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.fireconnect && git clone git@github.com:fw-ai/fireconnect.git ~/.fireconnect && bash ~/.fireconnect/install.sh
```

## Supported harnesses

| Harness | Command | Config it writes | Key storage | Before `on` / `off` |
|---------|---------|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| [Claude Code](#claude-code) | `fireconnect claude` | `~/.claude/settings.json` | Baked header literal (`0600`) | Restart after |
| [Codex](#codex) | `fireconnect codex` / `fireconnect chatgpt` | `~/.codex/config.toml` | Baked bearer literal (`0600`) | Restart after |
| [OpenCode](#opencode) | `fireconnect opencode` | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` | Baked literal (`0600`) | Restart after |
| [Pi](#pi) | `fireconnect pi` | `~/.pi/agent/{settings,models,auth}.json` | Baked literal (`0600`) | Restart after |
| [Cursor](#cursor) | `fireconnect cursor` | `state.vscdb` (SQLite) | IDE `safeStorage` | **Quit Cursor first** |
| [VS Code Chat](#vs-code-chat) | `fireconnect vscode` | `chatLanguageModels.json` + `state.vscdb` | IDE `safeStorage` | **Quit VS Code first** |
| [DeepSeek Harness](#deepseek-harness) | `fireconnect deepseek` | `~/.dsh/settings.yaml` + `.credentials.yaml` | Baked credential (`0600`) | Restart `dsh` after |

Every harness supports `on`, `off`, `status`, and `help`. `off` restores your pre-connect
configuration — file-based harnesses byte-for-byte from a snapshot under `~/.fireconnect/`,
and the IDEs by removing only what FireConnect registered.

## Default models

| Slot / harness | Default |
|----------------|---------|
| Claude `main` | Claude default (unpinned) |
| Claude `opus` | `firerouter` on first connect with a standard key; otherwise `glm-latest` |
| Claude `sonnet` | `deepseek-pro-latest` |
| Claude `fable` | `glm-flash-latest` (vision) |
| Claude `haiku` | `deepseek-flash-latest` (text-only) |
| Claude `subagent` | `deepseek-flash-latest` (text-only; tool runner) |
| OpenCode, Codex, Pi, Cursor, VS Code, DeepSeek Harness | `kimi-fast-latest` |
| Fire Pass (`fpk_...`) | `kimi-fast-latest` everywhere |

Fire Pass keys are detected automatically — no flags needed. Saved Claude mappings are
key-scoped (Fireworks vs Fire Pass) and silently restored after `claude off` → `claude`.
Override anytime with flags or the [wizard](#model-mapping).

## Claude Code

```bash
fireconnect claude                       # wizard on first setup; flags work anytime
fireconnect claude --interactive         # reopen the model mapping wizard
fireconnect claude status                # mapping, auth, and per-slot rates
fireconnect claude usage                 # pick session → live meter (Tab agents, Esc sessions, q quit)
fireconnect claude usage --days 7        # widen the session list's lookback (default 3)
fireconnect claude usage --session <id>  # start on one session; Esc still opens the list
fireconnect claude usage --plain         # one-shot snapshot, no interactive picker
fireconnect claude live                  # tmux split: Claude Code left, live usage meter right
fireconnect claude demo                  # race two models on a prompt (requires routing on)
fireconnect claude off
```

Scripting and cost reporting — `status` and `usage` both emit machine-readable JSON:

```bash
fireconnect claude status --json         # provider, auth, mapping
fireconnect claude usage --last-n 5 --json  # snapshot the 5 latest sessions
fireconnect claude usage --verbose       # request-level rows and per-request rates
```

Settings apply per session: to pick up a new mapping, exit and resume with
`claude --resume <id>`, or start a new session.

### Model mapping

Claude Code has six model slots. FireConnect owns the mapping and prints it after every
successful activation. Configure it three ways:

```bash
# 1. Interactive wizard — first connect, or anytime
fireconnect claude --interactive

# 2. Slot flags — scriptable, combine freely
fireconnect claude --model kimi-fast-latest
fireconnect claude --opus glm-fast-latest --sonnet glm-fast-latest
fireconnect claude --haiku deepseek-flash-latest --subagent deepseek-flash-latest

# 3. Saved prefs / defaults, no prompts — CI and scripts
fireconnect claude --non-interactive
```

`--interactive` opens the wizard at any time, not just on first connect. It is Fable-first,
shows every slot on one screen, and needs a terminal — use the flags above in CI.

| Flag | Writes |
|------|--------|
| `--model` | top-level `model` (Claude's main / the `/model` "Default" row) |
| `--opus`, `--sonnet`, `--haiku`, `--fable` | matching `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` |
| `--subagent` | `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` |

Slots are independent — `--opus firerouter` changes only Opus and leaves main alone.
Use `native` as a slot value to leave it unpinned so Claude Code picks Anthropic's
default for that role (still routed through Fireworks). `on` is optional.

```bash
fireconnect claude --opus native --sonnet native   # native Opus/Sonnet
fireconnect claude --model claude-sonnet-4-5       # pin a specific Anthropic model
```

On first connect, the wizard opens on a single Fable-first mapping screen. Re-running
`fireconnect claude` without model flags preserves the current main when FireConnect is
already active (including `/model` changes made inside Claude Code), and otherwise
restores your saved key-scoped mapping.

### What gets written

Claude authenticates with a static `X-Fireworks-Api-Key` custom header
(`ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS`), **not** `apiKeyHelper`. `main` stays native (unpinned).
Every other slot is pinned in `env` to a Fireworks router alias unless you pick
`native` or `claude-default` for that slot in the wizard.

Baseline pinned slots (before any first-connect FireRouter auto-pin on Opus):

| Slot | Default |
|------|---------|
| Opus | `glm-latest` |
| Sonnet | `deepseek-pro-latest` |
| Fable | `glm-flash-latest` |
| Haiku | `deepseek-flash-latest` |
| Subagents | `deepseek-flash-latest` |

On **first connect** with a standard `fw_` key and FireRouter auth, Opus is auto-pinned to
`firerouter` and Sonnet to `glm-latest` (GLM moves off the Opus slot). Example settings after
that first connect:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.fireworks.ai/inference",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL": "firerouter[1m]",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL": "glm-latest[1m]",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL": "deepseek-flash-latest[1m]",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL": "glm-flash-latest[1m]",
    "CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL": "deepseek-flash-latest[1m]",
    "ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS": "X-Fireworks-Api-Key: fw_..."
  }
}
```

When FireRouter is not selected, `opus` uses `glm-latest[1m]`. `main` remains unpinned.

**Why the custom header?** The gateway authenticates via `X-Fireworks-Api-Key`, which wins over
any `x-api-key` / `Authorization` a stray `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` would
send — so a leftover Anthropic key can't silently break routing. The trade-off is a plaintext
Fireworks key in `settings.json` (mode `0600`); the OS keychain stays the source of truth for
`key export` and other harnesses. FireConnect keeps a byte-for-byte backup for `off`, and
pre-approves a stray `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `~/.claude.json` so Claude Code doesn't prompt on
first launch.

`on` also:

- Adds `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` to `permissions.deny` — Anthropic **server-side** tools the
  gateway can't run. Your own rules are preserved; the deny entries are removed on `off`. If
  your account is entitled to Fireworks web search, a `fireworks-websearch` MCP server is
  installed as the working replacement, with `Authorization: Bearer <key>` baked into
  `~/.claude.json` (same shape as `claude mcp add --header`).
- Installs a `statusLine` showing the routed model and Fireworks-rate session cost (see
  [Status line](#status-line)). An existing `statusLine` of your own is never replaced.
- Sends privacy-safe attribution headers where the harness supports them: `X-Title: <harness>`
  and `HTTP-Referer: fireconnect/v<version>`. `User-Agent` is never overridden, and these carry
  no user, account, path, repo, prompt, session, or credential data. Cursor and DeepSeek Harness
  expose no custom-header surface, so they skip attribution.

**Model IDs and `[1m]`.** Short slugs are accepted everywhere and canonical
`accounts/fireworks/...` IDs are shortened before write. The `[1m]` suffix is
applied **per model ID** when the resolved serverless context window is at least
1M tokens (live catalog cache when available, otherwise static specs), plus any
`firerouter*` gateway pattern. Router aliases such as `deepseek-flash-latest`
resolve to their base model before the limit check.
Every slot is tagged the same way, `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` included: Claude Code
reads the tag to size the context window and strips it before the request, so the
gateway still sees a real model ID. Without the tag Claude Code sizes an unrecognized
model at the 200K it assumes and auto-compacts the session down to fit, which is what
starves subagents on a 1M model.
The `[1m]` tag is Claude Code only; other harnesses (Cursor, etc.) should use the bare
model ID without the suffix.

### Text-only models and images

Claude Code has no way to mark a model as non-vision. Pasting or attaching an image while a
text-only slot is active can break the session — recover with `/rewind`. Activation prints a
one-line warning:

```text
Text-only: deepseek-flash-latest, glm-fast-latest · Avoid images; recover with /rewind.
```

The wizard and `fireconnect claude status` label every model `vision` or `text-only`.

### Pricing estimates

Claude Code's `/model` picker and session cost estimates use **Anthropic list prices**, while
Fireworks bills at **serverless rates** — the in-app estimate can look far higher than your real
bill. Use `fireconnect claude status` and `fireconnect model list` for Fireworks rates, check
[serverless pricing](https://docs.fireworks.ai/serverless/pricing), and see the
[billing dashboard](https://app.fireworks.ai/account/billing) for actual spend.

### Status line

`on` installs a `statusLine` in `settings.json` that shows the models actually serving the session
and its cost at Fireworks rates:

```text
━━━━━━━━━━━━ ━ ━ · $70.39
━ Claude Opus 5 $62.91 98% cache · ━ GLM 5.2 $7.35 96% cache · ━ DeepSeek V4 Flash $0.13 87% cache
```

The first line is a **multi-color bar of where the money went** — one colored segment per backend
model, sized by its share of the session's spend — followed by the session total. FireRouter routes
each call dynamically, so rather than naming only the latest model the bar shows the whole mix at a
glance, weighted by what each one actually cost. Above, Opus 5 takes 47% of the calls but nearly the
whole bar, because it is 89% of the bill; that gap is the thing worth seeing, and a bar drawn by
call count would have hidden it. The bar carries no text on purpose: spend share is the one figure
without a natural unit, so printing it as a bare `%` beside the cache percentages made the line
ambiguous. Width says "how much of the spend"; the legend below names the models in the same order
with the exact dollars.

The line deliberately carries **no context-window figure**. Everything on it is something only
FireConnect can tell you — the model actually serving each call, its cost at Fireworks rates, its
cache hit rate. Context usage is Claude Code's own number, which it already surfaces through
`/context` and its auto-compact warnings, so repeating it here spent columns to say nothing new.

The second line attributes **spend and cache-hit rate per model**, each entry led by a swatch in its
bar segment's color. An entry reads `<model> <its cost> <its cache hit>`, and every figure carries
its unit (`$`, `% cache`) so nothing has to be inferred. That split is the point a single total
hides: above, Opus 5 takes 47% of the calls but 89% of the bill, and the subagent model's 87% cache
rate is a different story from the main thread's 96–98%. Cache is computed per model with the same
helpers as the live meter's `cache%` column, so the two always agree. Before the first call lands
there is no transcript to break down, so the bar is replaced by the slot alias.
`fireconnect claude usage` has the full per-model token table.

**Color carries identity only.** The swatches and bar segments are the sole colored elements; every
label and number stays in the terminal's own foreground so the line inherits your theme and the
figures read at one weight. The series hues are the validated dark-surface categorical steps — they
clear the lightness band, chroma floor, colorblind separation (worst adjacent ΔE 8.4), and 3:1
contrast against the surface — and segments are separated by a blank cell so neighbouring models are
distinguishable without relying on hue. `NO_COLOR` strips to plain text.

The cost is **not** Claude Code's own figure — that one prices every call against Anthropic's
list, so on a Fireworks gateway it reports a number you are never billed. FireConnect recomputes
it from the session transcript with the same engine behind `fireconnect claude usage`, which
prices each call by the model that actually served it. A session that switched slots mid-flight
(or a FireRouter session that sent hard turns to Claude) totals correctly, and subagent calls are
included. A `~` prefix means some model in the session had no published rate and fell back to a
reference price. `97% cache` is the cumulative prompt-cache hit share — the same figure the live
usage meter prints.

Rates come from the catalog cache `on` writes, so the line needs no network. `off` removes it.
**If you already have a `statusLine`, FireConnect leaves it alone** — delete yours and re-run
`fireconnect claude` to opt in.

## Codex

Routes [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex) through Fireworks via the
Responses API.

```bash
fireconnect codex                       # writes ~/.codex/config.toml
fireconnect codex status
fireconnect codex --model glm-latest      # switch model
fireconnect codex off
```

- Sets root `model_provider` / `model` for Codex 0.134+ (short slug) and adds a
  `[model_providers.fireworks-ai]` block with `wire_api = "responses"` and a **baked**
  `experimental_bearer_token` literal (mode `0600`). No shell hook needed.
- Writes the preferred serverless catalog to `~/.codex/fireworks-model-catalog.json` and points
  Codex at it via `model_catalog_json` (latest aliases preferred; embeddings, no-tool, and
  deprecated models filtered out). `off` removes the file and reference.
- Preserves unrelated settings (for example `[[mcp_servers]]`) via surgical TOML edits, and on
  `off` reconciles the shell hook when nothing else needs `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`.

> **MiniMax is not supported on Codex.** Codex may insert assistant messages between
> `tool_calls` and `tool_results`, which MiniMax chat templates reject. FireConnect fails
> `codex --model minimax-latest` with an explanation. Use MiniMax on a Chat Completions harness
> such as Claude Code or OpenCode.

`config.toml` updates immediately; exit Codex and `codex resume <id>` (or start a new session)
to pick up the change. Use `--config-path <path>` for a non-default config.

> **Resuming a prior session requires the matching provider to be on.**
> `codex resume` resolves the session's recorded `model_provider` against the live
> `config.toml`, so force the provider or it falls back to OpenAI:
>
> ```bash
> codex resume <id> -c model_provider="fireworks-ai"        # Fireworks gateway
> codex resume <id> -c model_provider="fireworks-azure"     # Azure/Foundry
> ```
>
> The provider table is removed by `fireconnect codex off`, so resume only
> resolves while the matching route is on.

`fireconnect chatgpt` is an alias for the same harness — `codex` and `chatgpt` share
`~/.codex`, so one command routes both the Codex CLI and the ChatGPT desktop app. Like the
IDEs, it asks you to quit the app first; `--force` writes anyway (not recommended).

## OpenCode

Routes [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) through Fireworks.

```bash
fireconnect opencode
fireconnect opencode status
fireconnect opencode --model glm-latest
fireconnect opencode off
```

- Merges a `provider.fireworks-ai` block into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, sets the
  default `model` to `fireworks-ai/<slug>`, and keys provider models by short slug.
  `options.apiKey` is a **baked plaintext literal** (mode `0600`).
- Registers the preferred serverless catalog in the provider's `models` for OpenCode's `/model`
  picker, falling back to the active model when the catalog can't be fetched (offline).

Use `--config-path <path>` for a non-default config.

## Pi

Routes [Pi](https://pi.dev) through Fireworks.

```bash
fireconnect pi
fireconnect pi status
fireconnect pi --model glm-latest
fireconnect pi off
```

- Sets `defaultProvider` / `defaultModel` in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` and stores a **baked
  plaintext literal** in `fireworks.key` (`auth.json`, mode `0600`). `on` applies
  `kimi-fast-latest` unless you pass `--model`.
- Registers the preferred serverless catalog in `~/.pi/agent/models.json` for Pi's `/model`
  picker. Managed IDs are canonical `accounts/fireworks/...` ids, so each entry overrides Pi's
  built-in catalog row in place with context, pricing, reasoning, and vision metadata from the
  shared Fireworks specs. Falls back to the last cached catalog offline.
- Snapshots and restores all three files (`settings.json`, `auth.json`, `models.json`). The
  registered model ids are tracked in `~/.fireconnect/config.json`
  (`harnesses.pi.profiles.managedModelIds`) so repeat `on` rebuilds exactly and `off` strips
  only what FireConnect added.

Use `--settings-path <path>` for a non-default settings file.

## Cursor

Cursor stores AI settings in SQLite (`state.vscdb`), so FireConnect writes there directly:

| Setting | Key |
|---------|-----|
| API key | `cursorAuth/openAIKey` |
| Base URL | `openAIBaseUrl` → `https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1` |
| Custom models | `aiSettings.userAddedModels` + `aiSettings.modelOverrideEnabled` |
| Hidden built-ins | `aiSettings.modelOverrideDisabled` |
| Per-mode model | `aiSettings.modelConfig[mode]` (e.g. `composer`, `cmd-k`) |

```bash
fireconnect cursor --api-key fw_...      # quit Cursor first
fireconnect cursor status                # read-only; safe while Cursor is open
fireconnect cursor --model glm-fast-latest
fireconnect cursor --db-path <path>      # non-default state.vscdb (e.g. Cursor Insiders)
fireconnect cursor off
```

`cursor --model <id>` registers the model and sets **every mode that already exists** in
`modelConfig` — it won't create modes you don't have. Direct Fireworks IDs are stored as short
slugs; legacy canonical entries migrate on the next `on`.

> **Quit Cursor (`Cmd-Q` / File > Quit) before `on` or `off`.** Otherwise Cursor's in-memory
> state overwrites the write on its next flush. In an interactive terminal FireConnect waits for
> you to quit (press Enter to confirm, or auto-detect); after ~90s it offers continue-anyway.
> `--force` writes anyway.

**While FireConnect is on, only Fireworks models work** — Cursor's built-in models (Auto,
subscription models, Opus modes) are hidden from the picker and won't respond.
`fireconnect cursor off` restores them, and only removes models FireConnect registered.

## VS Code Chat

FireConnect adds a `Fireworks` provider to `chatLanguageModels.json` (vendor `customendpoint`,
`apiType: chat-completions`) pointing at `https://api.fireworks.ai/inference` — VS Code appends
`/v1/chat/completions`. Azure/Foundry mode also uses `apiType: chat-completions`.

```bash
fireconnect vscode --api-key fw_...       # quit VS Code first
fireconnect vscode status                 # read-only; safe while VS Code is open
fireconnect vscode --model deepseek-flash-latest
fireconnect vscode --vscode-path <path>   # non-default chatLanguageModels.json
fireconnect vscode off
```

The API key is **not** in the JSON: VS Code resolves `${input:chat.lm.secret.<id>}` through
Electron `safeStorage` in its application-scoped `state.vscdb`. `on` writes both the provider
entry and the encrypted key under a `chat.lm.secret.fw-*` id. Same quit / `--force` rules as
Cursor.

`safeStorage` by platform:

- **macOS** — master key in the login Keychain (`<App> Safe Storage`); open VS Code once first.
  Insiders is auto-detected (`Code - Insiders Safe Storage`).
- **Windows** — AES-256-GCM with a DPAPI-protected key in VS Code's `Local State`.
- **Linux** — needs `libsecret` (`secret-tool`) for real encryption. Without it Chromium falls
  back to a hardcoded password (obfuscated, not encrypted); FireConnect still writes and warns.

`off` restores `chatLanguageModels.json` byte-for-byte and deletes the `chat.lm.secret.fw-*`
row; providers you configured yourself are preserved.

Per-model `toolCalling` / `vision` / token limits live in
`packages/setup-cli/lib/fireworks/model-specs.mjs`. Unmapped models default to
`toolCalling: true`, `vision: false`, with limits omitted until the model is added.

## DeepSeek Harness

Routes [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`) through Fireworks
via a custom OpenAI-compatible provider in `$DSH_HOME` (default `~/.dsh`).

```bash
fireconnect deepseek
fireconnect deepseek status
fireconnect deepseek --model glm-latest
fireconnect deepseek off
```

- Writes `llm-pi-ai.providers.fireworks` and `agent-default-model` into `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`
  pointing at `https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1`.
- Stores the Fireworks key as `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` in `~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml` (mode `0600`).
- Sets the default model for new sessions to the selected Fireworks model.

Use `--config-path <path>` for a non-default `settings.yaml` (credentials stay beside that file).

## FireRouter

FireRouter routes each request between Claude and Fireworks open models — simpler work stays on
open models, harder work can use Claude when you have BYOK. It's a normal **`firerouter` model**
on the Fireworks gateway — not a separate mode.
Select it like any other model.

```bash
fireconnect <harness> --model firerouter       # any harness
fireconnect claude --opus firerouter           # or a single Claude slot
```

| | |
|--|--|
| **Keys** | Standard Fireworks (`fw_...`) only — not Fire Pass |
| **Catalog** | Always in `fireconnect model list` for a standard key |
| **Pickers** | Auto-included with workspace BYOK (`enable-workspace-byok`), or a forwardable `sk-ant-...` `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` on harnesses that can attach one |
| **Auto default** | Claude Code `opus` only — first connect with a standard key and no explicit model flags |
| **No Anthropic key** | Still routes among Fireworks models |

**BYOK for Anthropic frontier models.** With workspace BYOK, your Anthropic key is used
server-side — no extra flags. Otherwise pass `--anthropic-api-key sk-ant-...` (or export
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) on a harness that can forward it. OpenAI BYOK is not supported.

| Harness | Local Anthropic BYOK | `--routing-preference` | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Claude Code | Header value | Yes | Fireworks header still wins for gateway auth; only harness that can auto-default Opus to FireRouter |
| OpenCode | Header value | Yes | `--model firerouter` registers only that model |
| Pi | Header value | Yes | Same Fireworks provider as other Pi models |
| VS Code | Header value | Yes | Same provider (`apiType: chat-completions`) |
| Codex | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env reference | No | Export the key, or use workspace BYOK |
| Cursor | Workspace BYOK only | No | Override UI can't attach a local Anthropic key |
| DeepSeek Harness | Workspace BYOK only | No | Same BYOK shape as Cursor |

Tune the cost/quality tradeoff where supported:

```bash
fireconnect claude --opus firerouter --routing-preference balanced
# max-intelligence (1) · more-intelligence (2) · balanced (3) · more-savings (4) · max-savings (5)
```

> The old `--router` flag is retired — use `--model firerouter` or a Claude slot flag.

More detail: [FireRouter overview](https://docs.fireworks.ai/ecosystem/firerouter/overview).

## Models

```bash
fireconnect model list
fireconnect model list --search glm
fireconnect model list --refresh
fireconnect model list --json
```

Fetches coding-tagged serverless models (`GET /v1/serverless/models?use_cases=coding`), adds the
per-model fast routers the API reports, and merges version-tracking aliases whose targets are
present: `glm-latest`, `glm-flash-latest`, `glm-fast-latest`, `kimi-latest`,
`kimi-fast-latest`, `minimax-latest`, `qwen-plus-latest`. Every row is tagged `serverless`.
The catalog is cached for **1 hour**; `fireconnect model list --refresh` bypasses that TTL
and refetches. If the network is unavailable, FireConnect keeps showing the last cached
catalog instead of deleting it.

US-only serverless routers are listed in their own section and accept short IDs:

```bash
fireconnect claude on --model kimi-k3-us
fireconnect opencode on --model glm-5p2-fast-us
fireconnect claude on --model glm-5p3-flash-us
```

US-only endpoints launched from September 1, 2026 are priced at a 50% premium over the
matching global row (`glm-5p3-flash-us`). Earlier routers keep their launch rates:
`kimi-k3-us` at a 10% premium, `glm-5p2-fast-us` at parity with global GLM 5.2 Fast. See
[US-only Serverless](https://docs.fireworks.ai/serverless/us-only-serverless).

Key resolution order: `--api-key` → `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` → stored credential. Standard keys
include `firerouter`; Fire Pass keys show only Fire Pass-supported routers (`glm-latest`,
`glm-fast-latest`, `glm-5p2-fast`, `kimi-fast-latest`).

| Command | Shows |
|---------|--------|
| `fireconnect claude status` | Provider, auth, alias mapping, **Fireworks rates** per slot |
| `fireconnect model list` | Serverless catalog with **IN / OUT pricing** where known |

Short IDs and canonical `accounts/fireworks/...` IDs both work, and `-latest` router aliases
(`glm-latest`, `kimi-fast-latest`, …) are recommended over pinned versions so you track new
releases automatically. Most non-Claude harnesses store short slugs; Pi stores canonical
`accounts/fireworks/...` ids — legacy configs migrate to each harness's format on the next
`on`. Not sure what to pick? Start from [the defaults](#default-models), browse
`fireconnect model list`, or run `fireconnect claude --interactive`. Foundry (Azure) uses
deployment names instead — see [Azure](#azure-microsoft-foundry-endpoints).

## Azure (Microsoft Foundry) endpoints

Fireworks models are also first-party models inside
[Microsoft Foundry](https://docs.fireworks.ai/ecosystem/integrations/azure-foundry), billed
through Azure and counting toward your MACC. Foundry exposes an **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint,
so **OpenCode, Codex, Pi, Cursor, and VS Code** can route there instead of the
Fireworks gateway.

Configure once, then `<harness> on` uses it — no per-command flags:

```bash
fireconnect configure --provider azure \
  --base-url https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com \
  --api-key <azure-api-key>

fireconnect opencode      # routes through the configured Foundry endpoint
fireconnect codex
```

`configure` stores a top-level `provider` and `azure` endpoint in `~/.fireconnect/config.json`.
Switch back with `fireconnect configure --provider fireworks ...`. You can also opt in per
command (or override the configured endpoint) with `--azure`:

```bash
fireconnect opencode --azure --base-url https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com \
  --api-key <azure-api-key> --model FW-GLM-5.2
```

- **Endpoint.** FireConnect normalizes whatever you paste — bare resource root, portal project
  endpoint (`.../api/projects/<name>`), or the `/models` route — to
  `https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/openai/v1`. Find it in the Foundry portal under
  **Project settings**.
- **Auth.** Use your **Azure** API key (not `fw_`/`fpk_`). `--api-key` writes it literally;
  exporting `AZURE_API_KEY` writes an environment reference instead.
- **Model.** The id is your Foundry **deployment** name — the catalog model name without the
  `fireworks-ai/` prefix (e.g. `FW-GLM-5.2`, `FW-MiniMax-M2.5`). Defaults to `FW-GLM-5.2`.
- **Isolation.** Each harness writes a dedicated `fireworks-azure` provider separate from the
  Fireworks gateway; `off` restores byte-for-byte and switching modes replaces it cleanly.

| Harness | Writes | Provider |
|---------|--------|----------|
| OpenCode | `provider.fireworks-azure` in `opencode.json` (`@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`, `options.baseURL` + `options.apiKey`) | `fireworks-azure/<deployment>` |
| Codex | `[model_providers.fireworks-azure]` in `config.toml` (`wire_api = "chat"`, bearer or `env_key = "AZURE_API_KEY"`) | `fireworks-azure` |
| Pi | custom `openai-completions` provider in `models.json` (`baseUrl`, `authHeader`, `apiKey` literal or `$AZURE_API_KEY`) + `defaultProvider` in `settings.json` | `fireworks-azure` |
| Cursor | OpenAI-compatible URL, deployment, and key in `state.vscdb` | `<deployment>` |
| VS Code | custom endpoint model in `chatLanguageModels.json`; key in `safeStorage` | `<deployment>` |

`fireconnect <harness> status` reports `azure` as the provider with the endpoint and model.

> Claude Code is intentionally excluded: it speaks the Anthropic Messages API, which Foundry
> does not expose. `model list` reads the Fireworks catalog and isn't used in Azure mode —
> select a deployment with `--model`.

## CLI reference

Harness-first: `fireconnect <harness> <command>`, plus a few global commands.

**Per harness** (`claude`, `opencode`, `codex`, `pi`, `cursor`, `vscode`, `deepseek`)

```text
fireconnect <harness> on           Route the harness through Fireworks (default if no command).
fireconnect <harness> off          Restore your previous provider/config.
fireconnect <harness> status       Show the provider, auth, and model mapping.
fireconnect <harness> status --json  Machine-readable state (CI checks).
fireconnect <harness> help         Show help for that harness.
```

All model changes go through `<harness> on`. Claude adds `fireconnect claude usage`, `fireconnect claude live`, and `fireconnect claude demo`.

**Global**

```text
fireconnect login                  Sign in — browser (creates a key) or paste a key you have.
fireconnect logout                 Clear the stored key (keychain entry + config ref).
fireconnect status                 Show sign-in state, machine environment, and key storage.
fireconnect model list             Browse the serverless catalog.
fireconnect configure              Set the provider (Azure/Foundry) and the Anthropic key.
fireconnect claude demo              Race two models on the same prompt via Claude Code.
fireconnect upgrade                Update FireConnect.
fireconnect uninstall              Disable + restore all harnesses, then remove FireConnect.
fireconnect --version              Print the installed CLI version (-V; --json for machine-readable).
fireconnect help                   Show help.
```

`login` asks one question: create an API key for this machine, or paste one you already have.
Create opens the browser, mints `fireconnect-{hostname}`, and stores it in the OS keychain —
confirming the account and where the key went. Paste masks input, validates live, and stores
only on success. `--paste` skips the chooser; `--with-token` reads from stdin (CI);
`--account <id>` signs into an enterprise SSO account. Already signed in? `login` asks before
replacing the key — `--force` skips that confirmation for key rotation.

`logout` removes the local key and offers to revoke the machine key server-side — `--revoke`
skips the question and revokes. You don't have to start with `login` — `fireconnect claude`
runs the same sign-in inline when a key is needed.

## Keys and storage

- `~/.fireconnect/config.json` holds a **reference** (`{keychain:fireworks-api-key}`), never a
  literal key. Legacy installs may still have `{env:FIREWORKS_API_KEY}`.
- The key itself lives in the OS keychain, or an encrypted-file / plaintext fallback tier when
  no secret service is available (`fireconnect status` reports which).
- `--home <path>` overrides HOME for config resolution and `--data-dir <path>` moves the
  backup/state directory — useful for sandboxed runs and tests that must not touch your real
  harness configs.
- Harness configs hold **baked literals** for Claude's custom header, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, and
  DeepSeek Harness; Cursor and VS Code use IDE `safeStorage`.
- Claude websearch MCP no longer uses a shell hook — the Bearer token is baked into
  `~/.claude.json`. Re-running `install.sh` or `fireconnect upgrade` shares one finalize path
  that rebakes enabled harness configs (and any existing websearch entry) to literals, including
  legacy env-reference auth left on disk.

**`FIREWORKS_API_KEY` interaction.** The env var and FireConnect-managed storage are mutually
exclusive for **login and other explicit store paths**. When it's set, `login` verifies and uses
it without copying it into the secret store, and combining `login` with a key-storing option
(`--api-key`, `--with-token`, browser, paste) fails before anything changes — unset the variable
first. `<harness> on` may still read it, persist it, and bake it into that harness's config.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Tool still uses the old model or provider | Fully restart the harness. In Claude Code, exit and `claude --resume <id>` — settings apply per session. |
| Cursor / VS Code changes don't stick | Quit the IDE (`Cmd-Q`) **before** `on`/`off`; the running app flushes its own state over yours. |
| Only Fireworks models respond in Cursor | Expected while FireConnect is on. `fireconnect cursor off` restores built-in models. |
| Claude session breaks after pasting an image | A [text-only](#text-only-models-and-images) slot was active. `/rewind`, then map that slot to a vision model. |
| Claude Code shows a scary cost estimate | It uses [Anthropic list prices](#pricing-estimates). Check `fireconnect claude status` for real Fireworks rates. |
| `firerouter` missing from a picker | Needs workspace BYOK or a forwardable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; otherwise select it explicitly with `on --model firerouter`. Not available on Fire Pass keys. |
| `login` fails with a key-storage conflict | `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` is set. Unset it to let FireConnect store a key. |
| `/model` picker ignores your main model | A legacy `env.ANTHROPIC_MODEL` is overriding it — re-run `fireconnect claude` once to migrate. |
| PowerShell install fails (`set: pipefail\r`) | Install from [Git Bash](#install-notes). |
| Linux warns the key isn't encrypted | Install `libsecret` (`secret-tool`); Chromium's fallback is obfuscation, not encryption. |
| Something else | `fireconnect status` shows sign-in, environment, storage tier, and every harness's state. |

## Upgrade and uninstall

```bash
fireconnect upgrade
# or re-run the installer:
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fw-ai/fireconnect/main/install.sh)"
```

Interactive terminals also offer an upgrade prompt when a newer version is cached
(`Upgrade now?`); declining snoozes it for a day.

Upgrading from **before 0.9.0** with Claude Code connected asks before temporarily restoring
your original settings, then tells you to reconnect with `fireconnect claude`. From **0.9.0**
onward, reinstall and upgrade leave harness settings alone apart from key rebaking and small
forward migrations (currently: VS Code's provider `apiType`, and adding `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH` to
managed Claude Code settings). Other harness settings and your stored API key are preserved
either way.

After updating the checkout, `fireconnect upgrade` runs its finalizer in a fresh process so
migrations are loaded from the new version rather than the old process's module cache. For the
transition from older upgraders, the changed package lock makes their existing upgrade path run
`npm install`; a durable-install-only postinstall hook runs that same new finalizer. Repository
and global npm installs do not match the durable layout and skip the hook.

```bash
fireconnect uninstall    # restores every harness, then removes ~/.fireconnect and the launcher
fireconnect uninstall --force   # no prompts — force-restore everything (CI / scripts)
```
