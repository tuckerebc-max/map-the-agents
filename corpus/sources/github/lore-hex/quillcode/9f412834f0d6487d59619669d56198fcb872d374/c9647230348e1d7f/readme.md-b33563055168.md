Quill Cowork combines project-aware chat, local tools, Git workflows, Computer Use, automations,
plugins, and a full workspace terminal in one SwiftUI desktop app. The desktop app and agent runtime
are written entirely in Swift, with no Electron or web-app shell. Bounded background work,
persistent local state, and a verified updater with automatic rollback are built into that Swift
architecture.

## Confidential Cowork

**Confidential Cowork by TrustedRouter** is the locked enterprise distribution of the same native
Swift app. It defaults to `trustedrouter/confidential`, requires Confidential-tier providers for
every model-backed request, supports US or EU processing policy, and fails closed instead of using a
standard route. It has a separate application identity and local data store, so it can be installed
beside Quill Cowork without sharing tasks or credentials.

The confidential policy also covers safety review, summaries, compaction, code review, fallback, and
model-assisted search. Settings cannot disable the policy or replace the official TrustedRouter API
endpoint. Build it locally with `scripts/build-confidential-cowork-app.sh`.

## What You Can Do

- Build Swift projects with a coding agent whose application and agent runtime are themselves Swift.
- Work across multiple projects and chats with project instructions, memories, and context.
- Read, search, edit, and review files; run shell commands; inspect Git changes; and manage branches,
  worktrees, commits, pushes, and pull requests.
- Use the integrated terminal, browser session, screenshots, and macOS Computer Use controls.
- Run concurrent chats, side conversations, code reviews, scheduled automations, and reusable
  recorded workflows.
- Add skills, plugins, hooks, and MCP servers while keeping approvals and workspace boundaries
  visible.
- Choose from the live TrustedRouter model catalog or use Quill Cowork's named model profiles.
- Track TrustedRouter usage across daily, weekly, monthly, and total limits, then set a **Task Limit**
  directly from the top bar before a long-running task spends more than intended.

## Install on macOS

The current desktop build requires **macOS 14 or later** and supports Apple silicon and Intel Macs.

1. [Download the latest Quill Cowork disk image](https://github.com/Lore-Hex/QuillCode/releases/download/tester-latest/Quill-Cowork-macOS-universal.dmg). The same installer runs natively on Apple silicon and Intel Macs.
2. Open the disk image and drag **Quill Cowork.app** onto **Applications**, then eject it.
3. Tester builds are ad-hoc code-signed but are not Apple-notarized yet, so macOS blocks the
   first launch. Launch the app once, then open **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and
   choose **Open Anyway**. Control-clicking **Open** no longer works on macOS 15 and later.
4. Sign in with TrustedRouter from the welcome screen, or add a developer key in **Settings**.

The [Apple silicon ZIP](https://github.com/Lore-Hex/QuillCode/releases/download/tester-latest/Quill-Cowork-macOS-arm64.zip)
and [Intel ZIP](https://github.com/Lore-Hex/QuillCode/releases/download/tester-latest/Quill-Cowork-macOS-x86_64.zip)
remain available as manual fallbacks and verified auto-update payloads.

Quill Cowork checks for updates automatically and also provides **Check for Updates...** in the app
menu. Downloads are size- and SHA-256-verified, the app identity and code signature are checked before
installation, the packaged source commit must match the public manifest, activation is atomic, and
the previous build is restored if the new build cannot render its first workspace window and remain
stable. Use **Report an Issue...**
in the app menu to open a prefilled GitHub report with bounded build and system information; it does
not attach project paths, transcripts, or credentials. After an unexpected exit, the next successful
launch identifies whether the prior session ended during startup or while running, warns that active
command work may be incomplete, and offers the same privacy-safe report path. A startup-phase exit
reopens with automatic project refreshes, automations, account checks, and optional driver discovery
paused until the user either keeps them paused for that launch or deliberately resumes them.

Unsent composer text is checkpointed after a brief typing pause and immediately when the app becomes
inactive or quits. Quill Cowork restores that text after an unexpected exit without rewriting the
potentially large chat transcript on every keystroke. Checkpoints are private, bounded, and scoped to
one chat; confidential-chat text is never written to them.

Live model output is also bounded and projected to the interface at display cadence instead of once
per provider token. The first useful text remains immediate, the exact final draft is preserved across
success and connection failure, and an oversized response offers a direct model-switch recovery path.

Choosing **Remind Me Tomorrow** defers only that exact update for 24 hours, including across app
restarts. A newer build appears on the normal check cadence, and **Check for Updates...** always
overrides the reminder. The app reopens its already-verified update state at the deadline without an
extra network request.

The moving `tester-latest` release is refreshed after verified main-branch changes. A scheduled
recovery check rebuilds only when the public manifest is missing, malformed, stale, or points at a
different commit. Direct links, the machine-readable build manifest, checksums, channel behavior,
and signing details are in [Downloadable Builds](docs/DOWNLOADS.md).

The public [Quill Cowork website](https://cowork.quillos.cloud/) is also sourced from `main` and
deployed through the verified GitHub Pages workflow. Its primary buttons always use the universal
installer. The page automatically prefers a validated notarized stable release when one exists,
falls back to the validated tester release, and keeps the known-good tester link when live metadata
is unavailable.

## Release Status

- **Tester:** public, automatically built from verified `main`, ad-hoc signed, self-updating.
- **Stable:** immutable versioned publication, Developer ID signing, notarization, and stable update
  feeds are implemented; the first stable release awaits the repository's Apple distribution
  credentials.

## Build from Source

Quill Cowork uses Swift 6 and Swift Package Manager.

```bash
swift test
swift run quill-code-desktop
swift run quill-code --mock "summarize this repository"
swift run quill-code doctor --summary
```

`quill-code` defaults to live TrustedRouter where the command requires a model. Pass `--mock` for a
deterministic local run, or configure a developer key with `swift run quill-code auth set-key KEY`.
The desktop app supports browser sign-in and developer-key management directly in Settings.

For the complete process-level test suite:

```bash
./scripts/smoke.sh
```

Agent changes merge through the serialized [Merge Train](docs/MERGE_TRAIN.md), which reruns CI and
publishes an exact-main tester build after every successful merge.
