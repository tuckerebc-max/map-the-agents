# Agent Skills

Wolfpack skills are executable agent instructions stored as ordinary repository
files under `skills/`. Audit each requested `SKILL.md` before installing it.
The repository, not a compiled executable, is the source of truth.

Bundled skill:

- `wolfpack-tailnet-control` - top-level session creation, same-harness child
  spawning, and safe local/Tailscale session inspection/control workflows.

## Pi opt-in setup

`wolfpack setup` checks for `pi` on `PATH`. Pi users receive one default-no,
opt-in offer for the Wolfpack control skill plus Pi Tasks; users without Pi
receive no offer. Accepting copies the bundled control skill into Pi before it
runs Pi's package manager with this command:

```bash
pi install npm:@sgtbeatdown/pi-tasks
```

Wolfpack does not install the full `wolfpack-bridge` app inside Pi just to obtain
the control skill.

The packages and resources have distinct ownership:

| Owner | Resource | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wolfpack | `wolfpack-tailnet-control` | Creates and controls visible Wolfpack sessions through the canonical CLI. |
| Pi Tasks extension | `agent_task_*` | Delivers assignments and stores structured task status/results; it does not spawn sessions. |
| Pi Tasks skill | `wolfpack-pi-task-delegation` | Teaches Pi how to combine the session-control skill with task dispatch, completion, and parent-owned cleanup. |

`npm:@sgtbeatdown/pi-tasks` contains both the extension and its matching
delegation skill, so those two stay version-aligned. Every participating Pi
session needs Pi Tasks loaded and a reachable local Wolfpack task gateway. The
server-owned task store is machine-global, and trusted Tailnet peer routing uses
stable broker session IDs rather than a project-local filesystem store. See
[docs/task-gateway.md](task-gateway.md) for the canonical task gateway contract.

Declining changes nothing. If writing the control skill fails, setup removes the
newly created skill directory before advising a retry; if cleanup also fails, it
identifies the partial path for review and manual removal. Non-interactive setup
installs nothing and directs Pi users to rerun `wolfpack setup` interactively. Package extensions and skills
can execute commands with the user's permissions, so review them before opting
in. Start a fresh agent context afterward, or run `/reload` in an existing Pi
session.

## Clone or update the auditable source

Use a dedicated clone. Updating is fast-forward-only so this workflow does not
silently create a merge:

```bash
REPO="$HOME/src/wolfpack"
if [ -d "$REPO/.git" ]; then
  git -C "$REPO" pull --ff-only
else
  git clone https://github.com/almogdepaz/wolfpack "$REPO"
fi
```

Before installing the control skill, review its complete instruction file:

```bash
less "$REPO/skills/wolfpack-tailnet-control/SKILL.md"
```

Skills can direct an agent to run commands. Do not skip this audit merely
because the source came from the Wolfpack repository.

## Manual installation required for non-Pi harnesses

`wolfpack setup` installs the control skill only for Pi after explicit opt-in.
If you use Claude, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, or another Agent Skills-capable
harness, manually add `wolfpack-tailnet-control` to that harness's global skill
root before expecting the agent to control Wolfpack sessions.

Known global roots relevant to Wolfpack are:

- Pi global: `~/.pi/agent/skills/`
- shared Agent Skills root supported by Pi: `~/.agents/skills/`
- Claude global: `~/.claude/skills/`
- another Agent Skills-capable harness: use the global skill root documented by that harness

For shared skill directories, prefer symlinking each desired Wolfpack skill so
a later reviewed `git pull --ff-only` updates the installed source. Choose the
root for the harness that needs session control; this example uses Pi global:

```bash
REPO="$HOME/src/wolfpack"
SOURCE="$REPO/skills/wolfpack-tailnet-control"
DEST_ROOT="$HOME/.pi/agent/skills"
DEST="$DEST_ROOT/wolfpack-tailnet-control"

[ -d "$SOURCE" ] || {
  printf 'skill source not found: %s\n' "$SOURCE" >&2
  exit 1
}
mkdir -p "$DEST_ROOT"
[ ! -e "$DEST" ] && [ ! -L "$DEST" ] || {
  printf 'refusing to replace existing skill: %s\n' "$DEST" >&2
  exit 1
}
ln -s "$SOURCE" "$DEST"
```

To target the shared Pi-compatible root or Claude global root, set `DEST_ROOT`
to `$HOME/.agents/skills` or `$HOME/.claude/skills` before running the same
existence checks. For another harness, set it to that harness's documented root.
Never force the link or overwrite an existing destination.

Copying is an alternative for agents or environments that cannot follow
symlinks. It uses the same fail-closed destination check:

```bash
REPO="$HOME/src/wolfpack"
SOURCE="$REPO/skills/wolfpack-tailnet-control"
DEST_ROOT="$HOME/.pi/agent/skills"
DEST="$DEST_ROOT/wolfpack-tailnet-control"

[ -d "$SOURCE" ] || {
  printf 'skill source not found: %s\n' "$SOURCE" >&2
  exit 1
}
mkdir -p "$DEST_ROOT"
[ ! -e "$DEST" ] && [ ! -L "$DEST" ] || {
  printf 'refusing to replace existing skill: %s\n' "$DEST" >&2
  exit 1
}
cp -R "$SOURCE" "$DEST"
```

A copied skill must be refreshed manually after reviewing repository updates.
In either case, start a fresh agent context so skill descriptions are rescanned.

## Invoke the control skill

For a top-level project session:

```bash
wolfpack session create <project> --harness pi --plan .plans/000-task.md --json
```

For a same-harness child of the current agent:

```bash
wolfpack agent spawn <project> --name 200-implementation --plan .plans/000-task.md --notify-parent --json
```

Use `--name` to pick a short issue/role slug, `--plan` for plan work, and
`--prompt-file` for long bespoke instructions; avoid pasting full plans or repository policy into the launch command. The
control skill documents the tailnet/global auth boundary and references
canonical session-control and identity docs instead of duplicating those
contracts.

## Distribution boundary

The npm package includes `skills/` for inspection, but it is the Wolfpack
application package and Wolfpack does not install it inside Pi. The released CLI
bundles the control skill and copies it into Pi only after explicit opt-in.
Platform binaries do not expose skills as files. Setup does not edit Pi settings
or overwrite skill directories. The cloned repository remains the auditable
source of truth for manual installation.
