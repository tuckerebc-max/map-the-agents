## Roo Code to Zoo Code migration

You can find a quick guide for migrating from Roo Code to Zoo Code in the [Roo→Zoo migration guide](https://docs.zoocode.dev/roo-to-zoo-migration). We plan to try and help users as they transition over, we have our [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZooCode) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/VxfP4Vx3gX)
for this exact support, so if you are having problems or if you have question, jump on and ask.

## What Zoo Code Has Added Since Roo Code

Zoo Code builds on the foundation created by Roo Code and continues to expand it with:

- **Semble codebase intelligence** — fast, on-demand semantic code search with automatic setup and no separate indexing workflow.
- **Stronger Orchestrator workflows** — safer delegation, parallel task coordination, reliable parent/child task recovery, and better isolation between subtasks and provider profiles.
- **Longer autonomous runs with Destructive Command Guard (DCG)** — automatically block dangerous commands while trusted work continues without repeated approval prompts.
- **The latest models** — ongoing support for new Claude, GPT, Gemini, Kimi, GLM, Grok, MiniMax, and other model families.
- **More ways to connect** — new and expanded providers including Zoo Gateway, Moonshot, Kimi Code, Kenari, Friendli, OpenCode Go, and many more.
- **More dependable terminal and editing workflows** — fixes for premature terminal completion, task-state races, context management, diff editing, and provider-specific tool use.
- **More control over your workspace** — rules management, per-mode MCP restrictions, multi-root path controls, model reasoning options, and completion change review actions.

## What's New in v3.82.0

- 🔑 **Use your Zoo Gateway API key anywhere** — bring it to any OpenAI-compatible client or workflow: https://zoocode.dev/models
- 🎁 **Free model access for a limited time** — get free access to MiniMax-M3 through Zoo Gateway.
- ✨ **Brand-new models** — GPT-6 Astra and Claude Fable 5.1 are now available.

## Local Setup & Development

1. **Clone** the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Zoo-Code-Org/Zoo-Code.git
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```sh
pnpm install
```

3. **Run the extension**:

There are several ways to run the Zoo Code extension:

### Development Mode (F5)

For active development, use VSCode's built-in debugging:

Press `F5` (or go to **Run** → **Start Debugging**) in VSCode. This will open a
new VSCode window with the Zoo Code extension running.

- Changes to the webview will appear immediately.
- Changes to the core extension will also hot reload automatically.

### Automated VSIX Installation

To build and install the extension as a VSIX package directly into VSCode:

```sh
pnpm install:vsix [-y] [--editor=<command>]
```

This command will:

- Ask which editor command to use (code/cursor/code-insiders) - defaults to
  'code'
- Uninstall any existing version of the extension.
- Build the latest VSIX package.
- Install the newly built VSIX.
- Prompt you to restart VS Code for changes to take effect.

Options:

- `-y`: Skip all confirmation prompts and use defaults
- `--editor=<command>`: Specify the editor command (e.g., `--editor=cursor` or
  `--editor=code-insiders`)

### Manual VSIX Installation

If you prefer to install the VSIX package manually:

1. First, build the VSIX package:
    ```sh
    pnpm vsix
    ```
2. A `.vsix` file will be generated in the `bin/` directory (e.g.,
   `bin/zoo-code-<version>.vsix`).
3. Install it manually using the VSCode CLI:
    ```sh
    code --install-extension bin/zoo-code-<version>.vsix
    ```
