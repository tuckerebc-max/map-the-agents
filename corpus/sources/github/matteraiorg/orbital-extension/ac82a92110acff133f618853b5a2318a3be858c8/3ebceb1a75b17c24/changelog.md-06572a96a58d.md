# Changelog

## [v6.8.5] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- **Generalized malformed tool-call JSON repair (`src/utils/jsonRepair.ts`).** A new best-effort repair layer (`parseToolCallArguments`) is now the single entry point for every tool-call argument ingestion path — live streaming, stream finalization, and MCP argument validation. When a model emits almost-JSON arguments, the call is repaired and executed instead of being dropped (weaker models repeat the exact same mistake on retry, dead-looping the task). Repairs include: placeholder tags in structural positions (e.g. `"limit": <longcat_arg_value>180` keeps the value; a tag-only value becomes `null` so the tool's default applies; a tag inside a key is stripped), unquoted keys and scalar values (`{path: "src"}`, `{"file_pattern": *.ts}`), single-quoted keys/values, Python literals (`True`/`False`/`None`), `//` and `/* */` comments, trailing commas, missing commas between members, and lost key quotes (`{"offset: 600, ...}`). At stream finalization only, truncated arguments are recovered by closing dangling strings and open containers innermost-first, appending `null` after a dangling colon, and wrapping braceless bodies (`path: "src"`); during streaming an incomplete buffer stays unparseable so deltas keep accumulating. A single-object array is unwrapped when the model wrapped the tool object by mistake. Valid JSON is always strict-parsed first and returned verbatim (`repaired: false`) — the only exception is stripping a leaked placeholder tag from a key, since keys are structural parameter names; tags inside string values are legitimate content and are never touched.
- **Repair transparency.** `ToolUse` blocks now carry a `repaired` flag; when a repaired tool call completes, the executed arguments are appended to the tool result as a note so the model sees what actually ran instead of repeating its malformed form on the next turn. `useMcp_tool` applies the same repair when validating MCP tool arguments and appends the same note.
- **Executor parameter hardening.** `read_file` (native JSON, single `file_path`, and XML paths) and the kilocode read-file path now parse `offset`/`limit` through a `parsePositiveInteger` helper that floors floats, clamps to a minimum of 1, and falls back to the tool default on non-numeric input; `search_files` floors fractional `max_results`/`context_lines` into their allowed ranges.

### Fixed

- **Placeholder-tagged tool arguments are repaired instead of dropped.** When a model emits malformed native tool-call JSON with a placeholder tag in value position (e.g. `"limit": <longcat_arg_value>180` or `"limit": <longcat_arg_value>`), the tag is stripped and the trailing value kept, or the value becomes `null` when no value follows so the tool's default applies. The repair runs only after strict `JSON.parse` fails, so valid JSON is never altered. Streaming partial previews are tag-cleaned as well.

## [v6.8.4] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- **Per-model usage visibility.** The usage dialog and a new Settings → Model Usage section now show each tracked OSS model's share of the shared plan pool as weekly/monthly percentages (no credit amounts), alongside the model's plan-cost multiplier badge (e.g. `5x cost`). The new settings section also renders the weekly/monthly plan windows with reset times and a refresh action, and is excluded from the save-button flow since it is read-only. Backend: `/axoncode/profile` now returns a `modelUsage` array (`model`, `multiplier`, `weeklyPercentage`, `monthlyPercentage`); charges for tracked OSS models are multiplied by their plan-cost multiplier before draining the shared pool.

### Changed

- **Dynamic model catalog synchronization.** Models are now dynamically fetched from the MatterAI backend `/v1/models` (or `/v1/web/models`) and registered into the client model registry (`registerDynamicKilocodeModels`), replacing static hardcoded lists while continuing to exclude deprecated axon models from active selection. Models automatically refresh on window focus, via the refresh button in the model selector, and through a 10-minute background poller. Cache bypass (`forceRefresh`) ensures database updates reflect immediately without restarting the extension.

- **OSS model catalog replaces Axon models.** The KiloCode model catalog (extension `kilocode-models.ts` and the webview `useOpenRouterModelProviders` copy) now exposes seven OSS models — `meta/muse-spark-1.2-contributor` (Muse Spark 1.2 Contributor), `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` (DeepSeek V4 Flash), `zai/glm-5.3` (GLM 5.3), `zai/glm-5.3-flash` (GLM 5.3 Flash), `gpt-5.6-sol` (GPT-5.6 Sol), `gpt-5.6-luna` (GPT-5.6 Luna), and `gemini-3.7-flash` (Gemini 3.7 Flash) — in place of the Axon context-window variants. Each OSS model carries its published per-token pricing (Muse Spark 1.2 Contributor $0.10/M input, $0.002/M cache read, $0.20/M output; DeepSeek V4 Flash $0.14/M input, $0.028/M cache read, $0.28/M output; GLM 5.3 $1.40/M input, $0.14/M cache read, $4.40/M output; GLM 5.3 Flash $0.15/M input, $0.03/M cache read, $0.50/M output; GPT-5.6 Sol $5/M input, $0.50/M cache read, $30/M output; GPT-5.6 Luna $0.20/M input, $0.02/M cache read, $1.20/M output; Gemini 3.7 Flash $0.75/M input, $0.075/M cache read, $3.75/M output). The default model is `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` (`openRouterDefaultModelId` in `@roo-code/types`, plus the CLI `kilocodeModel` defaults and web-evals `MODEL_DEFAULT`). Stored Axon model selections are now stale and reset to the default on next launch via the existing `isValidKilocodeModel` stale-model check.

### Fixed

- **OpenRouter models no longer wiped on background refresh.** `refreshKilocodeModels` (window-focus refresh, 10-minute poller, startup fetch) previously posted `openrouter: {}` to the webview, blanking the OpenRouter model list until the next manual reload. It now fetches both `openrouter` and `kilocode-openrouter` in parallel (mirroring the `requestRouterModels` handler) and posts the merged payload, logging and skipping only the provider that failed.
- **Stale model selections reset on launch.** The dynamic catalog is now fetched once at provider startup (after `ContextProxy` initialization) and the webview state re-posted, so the `isValidKilocodeModel` stale-model check runs against a populated catalog instead of the empty-catalog bypass. Previously, a stored axon model survived until the first focus- or webview-triggered fetch completed.

## [v6.8.2] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- **Parallel execution of independent read-only tools.** When a native-JSON provider returns several independent read/search calls in one assistant message (`read_file`, `search_files`, `list_files`, `list_code_definition_names`, `codebase_search`, `lsp`), they now run concurrently (up to 4 at a time via `MAX_PARALLEL_READ_ONLY_TOOLS` in the new `src/core/tools/toolExecutionPolicy.ts`) and their results are committed in model order so tool_use/tool_result pairing stays intact. Mutating, interactive, and external tools remain on the serialized path; read approvals inside a batch render as non-interactive progress rows instead of sharing the task's single ask promise. `parallel_tool_calls` is now enabled for native tool call providers.

### Changed

- **`search_files` is one-shot and ripgrep-first.** Ripgrep is now the default engine with FFF as the fallback; the default and maximum result count rose from 50 to 100; the model-facing `cursor` parameter was removed from both the XML and native JSON tool schemas. Pages that hit the cap say "additional matches omitted; refine the search pattern or path instead of paginating."
- **System prompt condensed.** The RULES, tool-use guidelines, and objective sections were rewritten to be shorter and tool-agnostic: `codebase_search` is recommended when the target is unclear instead of being mandatory before any exploration, the smallest sufficient tool is preferred, and independent reads/searches are batched in JSON mode while edits and commands stay sequential. The legacy text-tool guidance block is now only included for XML tool style.
- **Native tool schemas tightened for strict mode.** `execute_command` now requires `cwd`, `message`, and `isDangerous` (with destructive-action classification); `file_edit`/`multi_file_edit` require `replace_all`; `generate_file` requires `path`; `check_past_chat_memories` requires `workspace` (nullable where optional). The `lsp` description was condensed.
- **`allowedTools` metadata respected when empty.** `addNativeToolCallsToParams` uses mode-filtered tool exposure whenever provided, including an intentional empty list for tool-less modes, instead of falling back to the full native tool set.
- **Write delay default reduced.** `DEFAULT_WRITE_DELAY_MS` dropped from 1000ms to 250ms so routine edits do not add a second of latency; users with slower language servers can raise `writeDelayMs` in settings.
- **KiloCode notification polling disabled.** `fetchKilocodeNotificationsHandler` now responds with an empty notification list; the native-notification fetch/display path was removed.

### Fixed

- **Malformed tool-call JSON recovers instead of stalling.** Tool calls whose JSON arguments fail to parse at stream finalization are tracked by `AssistantMessageParser` (`getDroppedMalformedToolCalls`); the task loop injects a corrective message with a truncated preview of the raw arguments and retries, bounded by the consecutive-mistake limit.
- **Tool-repetition auto-retry is bounded.** The automatic "try again" response for repeated identical tool calls is capped at 2 attempts (`MAX_TOOL_REPETITION_AUTO_RETRIES`); after the budget is exhausted an error row tells the model to change approach instead of looping forever.

---

## [v6.8.1] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- **Investigation efficiency guidance in system prompt.** Added an "Investigation efficiency" section to the shared tool-usage instructions (`applyDiffToolDescription` in `src/core/prompts/system.ts`) that directs the agent to classify comprehension questions separately from implementation tasks, form a one-line hypothesis before searching, read call sites rather than implementation internals, avoid reading prose/content when the question is about control flow, and stop exploring as soon as it can answer.
- **Overlapping read detection in `read_file`.** `readFileTool.ts` now detects when a requested file region partially overlaps with a region already read earlier in the same task (same file, same mtime). The exact-match short-circuit (unchanged) still blocks identical re-reads; the new overlap check prepends a notice to the served content telling the model which lines are already in context, so it does not waste a follow-up call re-reading the overlapping portion. This catches the common failure of reading lines 600-849 then 800-1059 of the same file.
- **Zero-result guidance in `search_files`.** `searchFilesTool.ts` now appends actionable guidance when a search returns 0 matches, directing the model to tighten or simplify the regex, widen the path scope, try a different glob, or stop searching after 2+ failed attempts. This prevents the search to 0 results to slightly different regex to 0 results loop.
- **Native tool description improvements.** The `read_file` native tool description now tells the model not to read file contents (prompt text, config values, prose) when investigating control flow, and not to re-read regions already read earlier. The `search_files` native tool description now tells the model to scope the path to the narrowest plausible directory and to stop after 2+ zero-result searches.

---

## [v6.9.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- **`generate_file` native tool.** Orbital can now produce real file artifacts (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, CSV, MD, TXT, HTML) directly from the chat. The tool delegates to the MatterAI backend (`/axoncode/generateFile`, Bearer-token auth) and holds the resulting binary in memory as base64 — no files are written to disk until the user explicitly saves. The chat row renders a file card with a type-specific icon, file name, type label, file size, and two text buttons: **View File** opens a dedicated editor-tab webview panel (`ViewColumn.Beside`) that renders each type natively — PDF via PDF.js canvas rendering (no browser plugin, avoids the VS Code webview sandbox restriction), HTML as live rendered content, Markdown via marked.js, PPTX presentation decks parsed from Marp-style slide markdown with accent colors and structured cards, CSV as an HTML table, TXT/DOCX/XLSX as formatted text — and **Save File** writes the binary to the OS Downloads folder. The tool is public (no experiment flag) and lives in the `edit` tool group alongside `file_write` and `generate_image`.

---

## [v6.8.0] - 2026-08-01

### Removed

- **Fireworks AI provider.** Removed the Fireworks third-party provider (handler, settings schema, model fetcher entry, model selector, settings UI, docs, icon, CLI registry, JSON-schema entries, and `fireworksApiKey` / `getFireworksApiKey` i18n strings across all 22 locales). Existing `fireworksApiKey` values in stored profiles are no longer recognized; users will be prompted to pick a different provider on next launch.

---

## [v6.7.2] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- **Organization usage metrics.** Orbital now reports metadata-only user-message events, accepted agent line counts with model/client/IDE dimensions, and newly observed Git commit line totals for AI-share, active-user, leaderboard, conversation, and client-version analytics. Prompt content and file contents are never included.
- **Axon Lumen 4 model support.** Added support for `axon-lumen-4-code` in 200K and 400K context variants (`axon-lumen-4-code-200k` and `axon-lumen-4-code-400k`). Lumen models are available on Pro Plus and Ultra plans.
- **Plan gating for Lumen models.** Lumen models now show the same warning icon and upgrade tooltip as 400k context variants for users on plans below Pro Plus, are disabled in the chat model selector, hidden from the settings model picker, and fall back to `axon-eido-3-code-pro-200k` when a restricted Lumen model is selected.

### Changed

- **Flash model display name.** Axon Eido 3 Flash now shows `(200K context)` in its display name, consistent with the other Axon model variants.
- **Orbital update restart sequence.** The "Update & Restart" action now waits one minute after the update finishes installing, then restarts all extensions, reloads the window, and restarts all extensions again. The MatterAI progress animation remains visible during the wait.

---

## [v6.6.9] - 2026-07-25

### Changed

- **Remove free tag from Axon Eido 3 Flash.** Removed `(free)` suffix from the Axon Eido 3 Flash model display name.

---

## [v6.6.8] - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- **File-edit tools reject ambiguous and guessed matches.** `file_edit` and `multi_file_edit` now require `old_string` to be copied verbatim from a current read of the file and to identify exactly one location. The XML and native JSON tool descriptions, parameter descriptions, and the system-prompt editing discipline section were rewritten to forbid inventing, reconstructing, or guessing file content, indentation, whitespace, or escaping, and to direct the model to re-read the intended target and retry with exact surrounding context on a missing or multiple-match error.
- **`replace_all` is intentional-only.** The `replace_all` parameter description now states it must be set to true only after verifying the requested change should apply to every occurrence, never merely to bypass a multiple-match error.
- **Clearer ambiguous-match errors.** `performReplacement` now reports the match count and the line numbers where matches start (capped at five, deduplicated, with a "first N of M" suffix when truncated) instead of a generic "matched multiple locations" message, and stops at the first ambiguous candidate so a looser strategy cannot guess which occurrence was intended.
- **Clearer not-found errors.** The not-found error now appends guidance that no edit was applied, that the model must not guess or invent a corrected `old_string`, and that it should re-read the intended target and copy the exact current text before retrying.

### Added

- **`getMatchDiagnostics` in `fileEditTool.ts`.** New helper that counts every match start (including overlaps) incrementally without allocating per-match prefixes or arrays, and returns the occurrence count plus a capped, deduplicated list of starting line numbers for concise error messages.
- **File-edit safety spec.** New `src/core/prompts/tools/__tests__/file-edit-safety.spec.ts` asserts the text and native tool descriptions require verbatim unique matches and forbid bypassing ambiguity errors.
- **Ambiguous-match tests.** New cases in `performReplacement.spec.ts` cover rejecting ambiguous exact matches, same-line duplicate line-number formatting, overlapping match locations, and allowing repeated matches only when `replace_all` is intentional.

---

## [v6.6.7] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **FFF-backed `search_files` with ripgrep fallback.** `search_files` now runs through the native `@ff-labs/fff-node` file finder first, falling back to a streaming ripgrep implementation when FFF is unavailable or fails. Results are compact (at most three matches per file), paginated, and capped at a configurable page size so the model reads only the relevant regions instead of a context-flooding dump.
    - New `src/services/search-files` module (`index.ts`, `format.ts`, `types.ts`) is the single entry point: it tries FFF, falls back to ripgrep, and formats a compact `Engine / Matches / Next cursor` page.
    - New `src/services/fff/index.ts` wraps the ESM-only FFF SDK, keeps it out of the CommonJS bundle via a dynamic `import()`, caches up to three `FileFinder` instances per base path, encodes the user regex for FFF's query parser, and continues through FFF pages until `.orbitalignore`-filtered matches fill the requested page.
    - New `searchFilesWithRipgrep` in `src/services/ripgrep/index.ts` streams JSON ripgrep output, applies `.orbitalignore` before consuming the page budget, enforces the per-file match cap, and returns a ripgrep-engine cursor for continuation.
    - New `cursor`, `max_results` (1-100, default 50), and `context_lines` (0-2, default 0) parameters on both the XML and native JSON `search_files` tool schemas; cursors are engine-scoped (`fff:<offset>` / `ripgrep:<offset>`) and validated by `parseSearchCursor` / `normalizeNullableSearchString`.
    - `searchFilesTool` now parses the new params and delegates to `searchFiles`; `toolParamNames` and `SearchFilesToolUse` extended accordingly.
    - `esbuild.mjs` copies the FFF runtime packages (and their platform-specific native libraries) under `dist/fff/node_modules` so the packaged extension can resolve the native SDK; root `package.json` declares `pnpm.supportedArchitectures` so all platform FFF binaries install.
    - `extension.ts` disposes FFF finders and closes the native library on deactivate.
    - Tests for the FFF wrapper, ripgrep fallback, search-files orchestration, and cursor/format helpers.

### Changed

- **`search_files` system prompt rewritten.** The tool description and capabilities section now describe compact, paginated matches and direct the model to read the relevant file region rather than relying on large context windows. The verbose `file_pattern` quoting examples were removed in favor of a concise parameter list.
- **`ChatRow` shows the `file_pattern` for `search_files` rows.** Parallel searches are now distinguishable in the chat history by their glob, rendered as a `<code>` chip next to the regex.
- **Pinned todo list horizontal padding.** `ChatView` pinned-todo container padding aligned with the shared `mx-3.5` chat column padding.

---

## [v6.6.3] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- **Orbital update banner now polls continuously.** The in-app update banner no longer checks the Open VSX registry only once on mount. It now re-checks every five minutes (including while an update banner is already visible, so a newer release can replace a stale one), and whenever a long-lived view becomes visible again or the window regains focus. This keeps every open IDE window informed about subsequent releases without requiring an Extension Host restart. Polling is throttled to once per minute and pauses only while an installation or restart is actively in progress. The "Update & Restart" action now optimistically flips the banner to an installing state before the backend confirms, so the spinner appears immediately.

---

## [v6.6.1] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **In-app Orbital extension update banner.** When running inside the Orbital IDE, the chat view now polls the Open VSX registry on mount and shows a banner above the composer when a newer version of the extension is available. The banner surfaces the latest version, an "Update & Restart" action that installs the update via `workbench.extensions.installExtension` and reloads the window, and a retry button on failure. Progress states (downloading / installing / restarting) are reflected inline with a spinner. The check is gated to Orbital hosts (`appName === "orbital"` or `uriScheme === "orbital"`) so VS Code installs are unaffected.
- **`src/services/orbital/extensionUpdate.ts`.** New module exposing `checkForOrbitalExtensionUpdate`, `installOrbitalExtensionUpdate`, `isOrbitalIde`, and a semver-aware `isNewerVersion` helper that handles `v`-prefixed and prerelease tags.
- **`orbitalUpdate` i18n strings.** New `chat:orbitalUpdate.*` keys (`available`, `description`, `updateAndRestart`, `downloading`, `installing`, `restarting`, `failed`, `retry`).

### Changed

- **Primary button border-radius.** `vscode-button[appearance="primary"]` border-radius bumped from `6px` to `7px` in `webview-ui/src/index.css` for a slightly softer corner.

---

## [v6.6.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Axon Eido 3 context-window variants.** `axon-eido-3-code-pro` and `axon-eido-3-code-mini` are now exposed as separate 200K and 400K context options (`-200k` / `-400k` suffixes). Both variants share the same upstream model; the extension resolves the selected variant to its API model ID via `getKilocodeApiModelId`. The default model is now `axon-eido-3-code-mini-200k`.
- **400K context gated to Pro Plus and Ultra.** The 400K variants are only available on Pro Plus and Ultra plans. The model selector disables them with an upgrade tooltip for lower tiers, the KiloCode settings panel filters them out and auto-falls back to the matching 200K variant, and the CLI `/model` command rejects selection with a clear error message.
- **`SelectDropdown` group headings.** New `DropdownOptionType.GROUP` renders non-selectable section headings (e.g. "Context: 200k") inside the dropdown, with automatic hiding when the group has no visible items.
- **`SelectDropdown` custom value rendering.** New `renderValue` prop lets callers customize how the selected option is displayed in the trigger (used by the model selector to dim the context qualifier).
- **Sticky search bar in `SelectDropdown`.** The search input stays pinned at the top of the dropdown while options scroll.
- **New icons in `utils/customIcons.tsx`.** `BulbIcon`, `PlusIcon`, and `ArrowUp02Icon` added to support the refreshed model selector and chat composer.

### Changed

- **Model selector refresh.** Axon models are now grouped by context window with a `BulbIcon` indicator, the selected option is highlighted, and the trigger uses a compact rounded style matching the command-approval selector. Tooltips fall back to the model's description when no curated tooltip is defined.
- **Chat composer refresh.** The attachment button moved to the left of the model selector with a `PlusIcon`, the send button uses an `ArrowUp02Icon`, and the textarea padding was unified across edit and compose modes.
- **Follow-up question card.** Restyled with a rounded-xl border, subtle shadow, and improved typography (15px / leading-6). The suggestion list now uses bordered cards with a focusable copy-to-input button.
- **Shared chat horizontal padding.** New `CHAT_CONTENT_HORIZONTAL_PADDING` constant (`px-3.5`) in `webview-ui/src/components/chat/chatLayout.ts` is used by `ChatRow`, `ChatTextArea`, `ChatView`, `ExplorationGroupRow`, `BrowserSessionRow`, `QueuedMessages`, and the sticky user message so the chat column stays aligned.
- **Markdown list spacing.** `MarkdownBlock` list/ordered/unordered line-height bumped from `1.35em` to `1.7em` for better readability.
- **Task header title opacity.** `KiloTaskHeader` task title opacity raised from 70% to 100%.
- **Logout copy.** Logout notification changed from "Logged out from Roo Code Cloud" to "Logged Out from Orbital".

### Fixed

- **`WebAuthService.logout` state transition.** Logout now explicitly calls `transitionToLoggedOut()` after clearing persisted credentials, so the in-memory state, session token, and user info are cleared even when `SecretStorage.onDidChange` does not fire. The auth-state-changed event is emitted with the previous state.

---

## [v6.4.9] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- **Accept-all edit telemetry.** Accepting all pending edits from the IDE review bar now reports accepted line counts to the task metadata endpoint, matching the chat and per-edit accept actions.
- **Review-bar change navigation.** The up and down buttons now move between individual edit locations in the active file, while the left and right buttons continue to navigate between edited files.

### Added

- **`/create-skill` built-in command.** Users can describe a repository-specific workflow in plain language and have Orbital create or update a reusable skill under `.orb/skills/<skill-name>/`, including any supporting scripts, references, or assets within that skill directory.

---

## [v6.4.7] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **Official plugins marketplace.** The former Skills Marketplace now installs each `claude-plugins-official` entry as a complete bundle under `.orb/plugins/<plugin>/`. Installed plugin skills and slash commands use `plugin:capability` names, bundled MCP servers are registered with namespaced IDs, and the UI reports the bundle inventory after installation.
- **Shared `.orb/` convention with OrbCode CLI.** `AGENTS.md` is now loaded from the repo-level `.orb/` directory (alongside the project root and legacy `.orbital/`), so the Orbital IDE extension and the OrbCode CLI read the same project memory. Machine and settings locations are unchanged.
- **Linked-repositories service.** A new `src/services/links` module is the single source of truth for the linked-repo feature, sharing `.orb/links.json` and the produced environment context between the IDE extension and the CLI.
- **`/link` built-in command.** A new slash command for managing Linked Repositories: reads the current list, drives add/remove via `ask_followup_question`, and writes `.orb/links.json` with verbatim user input. Resolution and validation of the folder path happens at read time so links written by either tool stay portable.

### Changed

- **`/init` reworked for cold-start.** Replaces the verbose `.roo/rules-*` per-mode layout with a single, concise `.orb/AGENTS.md` (project structure, architecture, business-logic mapping, code patterns/conventions) capped at ~150 lines so it stays cheap to include in every future prompt. Existing AI assistant rules (CLAUDE.md, Cursor, Copilot) are still folded in. Refines an existing `AGENTS.md` rather than overwriting it.
- **Built-in commands spec.** The expected command list is now `commit`, `migrate`, `init`, `link`; `init` is asserted to target `.orb/AGENTS.md` with the new concise structure, and `link` is asserted to manage `.orb/links.json` via `ask_followup_question`.

---

## [v6.4.6] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Tiered usage support in `OutOfCreditsBanner`.** New `selectResetIso()` helper picks the correct reset time: when a tier is exhausted it surfaces the latest reset among exhausted windows; otherwise it falls back to the soonest upcoming reset, then to the legacy `creditsResetDate`. Banner label shortened from "Pro models limits reset at" to "Limits reset at".
- **OrbCode CLI marketing card.** A third rotating marketing card in the welcome view pointing users at the CLI, joining the existing two on the 10-second rotation (`(prev + 1) % 3`).
- **New custom icons in `utils/customIcons.tsx`.** `Folder01Icon`, `Folder02Icon`, `ArrowDown01Icon`, `AddCircleHalfDotIcon` and others added to support the refreshed MCP and history views.

### Changed

- **Orbital → Orbital rebrand in copy.** `troubleMessage` string in `chat.json` and the consecutive-mistake-limit description in `settings.json` now read "Orbital" where they previously read "Orbital".
- **Axon marketing copy.** Welcome-view subtitle changed from "Frontier LLMs, fraction of the cost. Save 70% inference cost." to "Cut agent inference costs by 60% using Frontier Axon models".
- **History UI refresh (`TaskItem`).** Visual and layout rework of the history list (90 insertions / 52 deletions).
- **MCP UI refresh (`McpView`).** Major rework of the MCP view with a new icon set and updated i18n strings (283 insertions / 228 deletions across `McpView.tsx`, `mcp.json`, and `customIcons.tsx`).
- **Login UI refresh (`KiloCodeAuth`, `ProfileView`, `WelcomeView`).** Consolidated the auth and welcome flows with refreshed i18n strings.
- **Chat agent UI refresh.** Visual updates to `ChatRow`, `ExplorationGroupRow`, and `ReasoningBlock` (63 insertions / 61 deletions).
- **Button UI refresh.** Updated button styles in `index.css` for consistency across surfaces (17 insertions / 5 deletions).

### Fixed

- **Stream idle timeout bumped to 180s.** `STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` raised from 60s to 180s to reduce false-positive timeouts during long-running streaming responses, especially with slower or more verbose model outputs.

---

## [v6.4.4] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Stream idle timeout**: 60s idle window on model stream consumption. If no chunk arrives within the window (network drop, socket close, server stall), a descriptive error is thrown so the catch block can persist the failure and surface a `streaming_failed` row to the UI
- **Stream disconnection UI surfacing**: New `streaming_failed` `ErrorRow` variant with a localized explanation of the likely cause for transport-level errors (ECONNRESET, socket hang up, fetch failed, ETIMEDOUT, ENOTFOUND, etc.), and a retry button matching the existing `Provider error:` behavior
- **`chat:apiRequest.streamDisconnected` i18n key**

### Fixed

- **Ripgrep binary resolution on modern VS Code / Orbital hosts**: `@vscode/ripgrep-universal` nests the binary in a per-platform subfolder (`bin/{os}-{arch}/rg`) that the previous lookup chain did not check, causing `getBinPath` to return undefined and file searches to silently fail. Adds the universal package to the lookup chain with both `node_modules` and `node_modules.asar.unpacked` paths
- **Unified message queue**: Replaced the local `manualMessageQueue` with the shared `messageQueueService` as the single source of truth. Queued messages now stay visible in the UI until they are actually dispatched; `isWaitingForAskResponse` is set before dequeue so a follow-up message resolves the ask rather than being re-routed into the queue

### Changed

- **About footer actions**: Export, import, and reset buttons now sit in a flex container with `gap-1.5` so the icon and label share a single evenly spaced row. Removed ad-hoc `pb-0.5` icon padding
- **Footer support copy**: Removed the dead Discord link; the message now ends at the Reddit mention

---

## [v6.2.3] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

---

## [v6.2.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Tool call result pairing safety net**: New `backfillMissingToolResults` function in OpenAI format transform that backfills placeholder tool messages for unanswered parallel tool calls, preventing provider rejections when tool_call/tool_result pairs are mismatched

- **Task.ts reconciliation**: Gating API requests until every tool_call in the assistant message has its matching tool_result collected, preventing partial result sets from being sent to providers

### Changed

- **AssistantMessageParser performance**: Avoided O(n²) string slicing in the streaming hot loop by deferring content updates to end-of-chunk; added 20KB max extract length threshold for large accumulated arguments during streaming
- **presentAssistantMessage optimization**: Replaced deep clone with shallow copy for streaming content blocks to reduce overhead during large file streaming
- **FileWriteTool partial display**: Truncated large file content during streaming preview (5KB limit) to prevent IPC bottlenecks and UI freezing
