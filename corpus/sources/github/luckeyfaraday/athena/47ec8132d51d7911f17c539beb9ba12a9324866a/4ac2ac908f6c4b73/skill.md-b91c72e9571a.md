description: Use when Hermes is working with Context Workspace through the context_workspace MCP server and needs to refresh, verify, report, inspect, or clear project-local recall context before answering project questions or launching future agent runs.

# Hermes Context Workspace Recall

Use this workflow to turn Hermes session memory into a project-local recall cache that Context Workspace automatically injects into future agent runs.

Hermes owns retrieval and summarization. Context Workspace owns injection into generated agent context. Agents consume the generated `context.md`; they do not need direct Hermes access.

## Preconditions

- The `context_workspace` MCP server is configured in Hermes.
- Context Workspace Electron is running, or `CONTEXT_WORKSPACE_BACKEND_URL` points to a healthy backend, for backend-dependent tools.
- The project path is the WSL path to the Windows checkout, for example:

```text
/mnt/c/Users/you/context-workspace
```

Recall cache tools read and write project-local files and can operate even if the backend is unavailable.

## Required Operating Pattern

Before answering a substantive task about a Context Workspace project, and before spawning or coordinating agents:

1. Run `session_search` for the current project, branch, task, PR, error, or investigation topic.
2. Call `context_workspace_summarize_agent_sessions` if native Codex/OpenCode/Claude session history may contain relevant current-state context.
3. Summarize only useful carry-forward context.
4. Call `context_workspace_write_recall_cache`.
5. Verify with `context_workspace_read_recall_cache`.
6. Report the refresh result briefly before continuing.

Use this report shape:

```text
Recall refreshed:
- project_dir: /mnt/c/Users/you/context-workspace
- query: <session_search query>
- bytes: <bytes written>
```

If there are no useful prior-session results, write a short empty-state summary instead of leaving stale recall in place:

```markdown
## Recall

- No relevant prior-session context found for this task.
```

## Context Workspace Refresh Hook

Context Workspace can request recall refresh through:

```text
POST /hermes/recall/refresh
```

The backend runs the command configured in:

```text
CONTEXT_WORKSPACE_HERMES_REFRESH_CMD
```

The Electron launcher sets a default command when the user has not provided one:

```text
python scripts/hermes-refresh-recall.py
```

That script writes the project-local recall cache directly and includes native Codex/OpenCode/Claude session discovery as fallback context. Use a custom `CONTEXT_WORKSPACE_HERMES_REFRESH_CMD` when Hermes should run a fuller `session_search` refresh before writing recall.

When invoked, the command receives:

```text
CONTEXT_WORKSPACE_PROJECT_DIR=<native project path>
CONTEXT_WORKSPACE_TASK_HINT=<current task or launch hint>
CONTEXT_WORKSPACE_BACKEND_URL=<backend URL>
```

The configured command should start Hermes with this skill or equivalent standing instruction. Hermes must run `session_search`, summarize useful prior context, call `context_workspace_write_recall_cache`, and exit nonzero if refresh fails.

Context Workspace uses this hook in three places:

- Manual `Refresh recall` action in the workspace UI.
- Pre-launch refresh before non-shell agent terminals start when recall is missing or stale.
- Background refresh after workspace selection when recall is missing or stale and the hook is configured.

If pre-launch refresh fails or the hook is not configured, Context Workspace asks the user whether to proceed with stale or missing recall.

## Refresh Recall

1. Run Hermes `session_search` for the current project, branch, task, or problem.
2. Inspect native agent session history when useful:

```json
{
  "project_dir": "/mnt/c/Users/you/context-workspace",
  "query": "recall Hermes sessions",
  "limit": 25
}
```

Use `context_workspace_summarize_agent_sessions` for a compact text result, or `context_workspace_list_agent_sessions` when exact session metadata is needed.

3. Summarize only the useful carry-forward context:
   - current objective
   - important decisions
   - relevant PRs, branches, commits, and files
   - known failures or caveats
   - next steps future agents should inherit
4. Call `context_workspace_write_recall_cache`:

```json
{
  "project_dir": "/mnt/c/Users/you/context-workspace",
  "markdown": "## Recall\n\n- Concise project/session context here.\n"
}
```

Keep the markdown concise. Do not paste raw search dumps unless the exact text is needed.

Prefer replacing the whole cache with the latest summary. Do not append indefinitely.

## Verify Recall

Call `context_workspace_read_recall_cache`:

```json
{
  "project_dir": "/mnt/c/Users/you/context-workspace"
}
```

Expect `exists: true` and the markdown that was just written.

Future Context Workspace runs read this file directly:

```text
<project>/.context-workspace/hermes/session-recall.md
```

The generated run context includes it under:

```text
## Hermes Session Recall Cache
```

## Clear Recall

If recall conflicts with current user instructions, points at the wrong branch/task, or becomes stale or harmful, call `context_workspace_clear_recall_cache`:

```json
{
  "project_dir": "/mnt/c/Users/you/context-workspace"
}
```

Then refresh recall before launching more agents.

When clearing, report it:

```text
Recall cleared:
- project_dir: /mnt/c/Users/you/context-workspace
- reason: <why the previous cache was stale or harmful>
```

## Operating Rules

- Treat Hermes memory as the durable source of truth.
- Treat the recall cache as a short-lived working summary for one project.
- Refresh recall at the start of each new work session.
- Refresh recall when the task, branch, or investigation direction changes.
- Prefer overwriting stale recall over appending indefinitely.
- Verify after writing so skipped or failed refreshes are visible.
- Report refresh or clear results so the user can audit whether the workflow happened.
- Do not rely on future agents calling Hermes directly; Context Workspace injects the latest recall into their generated `context.md`.

## Responsibility Split

```text
Hermes = search old sessions, decide when to refresh, summarize, refresh or clear recall
Context Workspace = expose app-side tools, inspect native agent sessions, inject latest recall into future agent context
Agents = consume generated context.md
```

## Troubleshooting

If backend-dependent tools fail, check `context_workspace_health`.

If health fails, start Context Workspace Electron first so this file exists:

```text
/mnt/c/Users/you/.context-workspace/backend.json
```

Recall cache tools can still operate without the backend because they read and write project-local files.
