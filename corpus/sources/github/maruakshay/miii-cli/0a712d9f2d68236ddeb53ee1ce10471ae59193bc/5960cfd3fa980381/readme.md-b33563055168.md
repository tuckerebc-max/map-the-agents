  🔒 <strong>100% local</strong> — your code never leaves your machine &nbsp;·&nbsp;
  💸 <strong>Free</strong> — no API keys, no per-token billing &nbsp;·&nbsp;
  ⚡ <strong>Offline</strong> — runs on your own GPU
</p>

## Install

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b   # any coding model works
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maruakshay/miii-cli/main/install.sh | sh
miii
```

Windows: `irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maruakshay/miii-cli/main/install.ps1 | iex` &nbsp;·&nbsp; any platform: `npm i -g miii-agent` &nbsp;·&nbsp; needs Node ≥ 18 and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download).

## Then just talk to it

```
> refactor the auth module to use async/await
> @src/server.ts add rate limiting to all POST routes
> why are my tests failing in utils/parser.ts
```

miii reads your files, writes the code, runs your tests, and fixes what breaks — planning before it acts, and verifying after. Entirely on your own GPU.

## Why local-first?

|------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Your code  | Sent to a third party | Never leaves your machine    |
| Cost       | Per-token billing     | Free — runs on your hardware |
| Setup      | API keys, accounts    | `npm i -g miii-agent`        |
| Offline    | No                    | Yes                          |
| Latency    | Network + queue       | Your GPU only                |

## Features

- **🧠 Works with small models** — miii repairs the malformed tool calls a 7B model emits instead of burning a turn on each one, and sizes its own prompt to your context window so the room goes to your code.
- **🧪 `miii doctor`** — not every local model can drive an agent. Grades your installed models on real engineering tasks.
- **🖼️ Paste images** — `Ctrl+V` a screenshot to ask why a UI looks broken. Needs a vision model (`llava`, `llama3.2-vision`, …).
- **💧 Lossless output spill** — a 50K-line test log is never truncated. The full text goes to disk and the model pages through it.
- **📋 Plan mode** — `shift+tab` (or `/plan`) makes the session read-only. miii researches your code, proposes a plan, and touches nothing until you approve it. The block is enforced by the harness, not asked for in the prompt: with no write tools and only reporting commands, a model that tries `sed -i` or `cat > file` anyway gets refused.
- **🔒 Permission-gated tools** — you approve what the agent touches, and see the exact rule before you save it. A saved wildcard never stretches across a command boundary, so approving `npm test` can't quietly authorize `npm test && rm -rf ~`.
- **⌨️ Your own slash commands** — drop `review.md` in `.miii/commands/` and `/review` is a command, in the palette, checked into the repo with everything else.
- **📄 `MIII.md`** — drop one in your repo to teach miii your conventions and commands. Same idea as `CLAUDE.md`, read every turn.

**Picking a model:** 8GB VRAM → `qwen2.5-coder:7b` · 16–24GB → `qwen2.5-coder:14b` (sweet spot) · 48GB+ → `qwen2.5-coder:32b`.

<summary><strong>Built-in tools</strong></summary>

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| `read_file` | Read any file in your workspace |
| `write_file` | Create new files |
| `edit_file` | Precise string-level edits, whitespace-tolerant |
| `glob` | Pattern-match files across the project |
| `grep` | Regex search across files |
| `run_bash` | Execute shell commands |
| `write_todos` | Track multi-step work as a live checklist |

File tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`) reject `../` traversal and absolute paths outside the workspace. `run_bash` is **not** path-confined — its only boundary is the permission prompt, so review commands before approving.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How "always" approvals are scoped</strong></summary>

Answering "always" saves both the exact command and a generalized glob (`npm run build` → `npm run *`), and the prompt shows you the widest rule before you choose.

Two things are never widened: destructive programs (`rm`, `dd`, `sudo`, `git reset`, …) and compound commands, whose first token says nothing about what the rest of the line does. A saved glob also refuses to match any command containing an unquoted `;` `&&` `||` `|` `>` or `$(…)`, so an approval can't be stretched past the command you actually read.

Saved rules live in **`.miii/permissions.json` in the project** — that is what "always" writes to. Approval subjects are usually project-relative (`src/index.ts` means a different file in every repo), so a rule that followed you everywhere would be granting far more than you agreed to. Rules in `~/.miii/permissions.json` apply in every project; put the ones you really do mean globally there by hand. `/permissions` lists both and says which file each came from.

Gitignore `.miii/permissions.json` — it is a record of what *you* approved. `.miii/commands/` is meant to be committed.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Permission modes</strong> — <code>shift+tab</code></summary>

`shift+tab` cycles the mode; the input frame changes colour with it.

| Mode | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| **normal** | asks before writing files or running commands |
| **plan mode** | read-only — research and a plan, approved before anything happens |
| **auto-accept edits** | writes files without asking; commands still prompt, since a command can reach outside the workspace |
| **bypass permissions** | runs everything without asking (red frame — for a sandbox or a throwaway tree) |

In **plan mode** the write tools are not offered at all and `run_bash` runs only commands that report — `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `git status/log/diff`, one at a time, no pipes or `&&`. A compound command is refused however harmless its first word, because `ls` tells you nothing about what comes after the `&&`. When the research is done miii calls `exit_plan_mode` with the plan and you get three choices: start work, start work and stop asking about the edits, or send it back for another pass.

<details>
<summary><strong>Custom slash commands</strong></summary>

A Markdown file is a command. `.miii/commands/review.md` becomes `/review`:

```markdown
---
description: review the staged diff
---
Review the staged diff for bugs and unhandled errors. Focus on $ARGUMENTS.
```

`$ARGUMENTS` is everything typed after the command; `$1`…`$9` are its individual words. A command that references neither gets the arguments appended, so nothing you type is silently dropped.

`.miii/commands/` is project scope — check it in, and the whole team gets it. `~/.miii/commands/` is yours in every project. A project command shadows a personal one of the same name, and neither can shadow a built-in.

<summary><strong>Configuration, other backends, and updates</strong></summary>

Settings live in `~/.miii/config.json`, created on first run:

```json
{
  "model": "qwen2.5-coder:14b",
  "effort": "medium",
  "providers": {
    "ollama": { "type": "ollama", "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434" }
  }
}
```

`effort` (`low` \| `medium` \| `high`) controls temperature and the output token cap. `numCtxCap` (default `16384`) bounds the context window miii asks for, so a model advertising a 131k window can't make Ollama size a KV cache that eats your RAM — it only ever lowers, never raises. A top-level `ollamaHost` still works and is folded into the `ollama` provider on load.

miii talks to any **OpenAI-compatible** local server too — [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai), vLLM:

```json
{
  "model": "qwen2.5-coder-14b",
  "provider": "llamacpp",
  "providers": {
    "llamacpp": { "type": "openai", "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8080" }
  }
}
```

Switch at launch with `miii --provider llamacpp`. Any `openai`-type provider on `localhost` counts as local — no key, no cloud.

**Updates:** miii checks npm on launch and pulls a newer release in the background, applied on next start. `miii update` to do it now, `miii --version` to check. Opt out with `"autoUpdate": false`.

**Install failing on permissions?** Your global npm prefix isn't writable:
```bash
npm config set prefix "$HOME/.npm-global"
export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"   # add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How output spill works</strong></summary>

When a tool result exceeds the inline budget (~10K bytes), the full output is written to `~/.miii/output/<id>.txt`. Only a head + tail preview is inlined, with a pointer:

```
[This command output was long (412900 bytes), so I'm showing the start and
 end. The full text is saved at ~/.miii/output/9f3a1c.txt — read it with
 read_file offset/limit to see the middle.]
```

The model pages through the middle with ranged `read_file` reads. Spill files are garbage-collected after 24 hours.

## FAQ

**Does miii work without internet?** Yes. Once you've pulled a model with Ollama, miii runs fully offline — no network calls, no account, no cloud.

**Is my code sent anywhere?** No. Every file read, edit, and inference happens on your machine — privacy is the default, not a setting.

**How is miii different from Claude Code, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot?** Those are cloud services — metered, account-gated, and they ship your code to a third-party server. miii is open-source, free, and runs entirely on your hardware, with the same terminal-agent workflow.

**How is it different from Continue.dev?** Continue.dev is an IDE extension. miii is a standalone terminal agent — no editor required.

**Which local LLM is best for coding?** `qwen2.5-coder` at the largest size your VRAM allows. Run `miii doctor` to grade what you have installed.

**Do I need a GPU?** No, but it helps. Smaller models run on CPU; a GPU makes larger ones fast enough for real work.

## Status

**MVP.** The core agent loop is stable; actively refining tool execution, streaming, and the permission model. PRs welcome.
