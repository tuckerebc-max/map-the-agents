# Atomic Monorepo — Development Setup

This document covers setup, the local dev loop, testing patterns, and project layout for working on the Atomic Bun workspace. The workflow extension lives at [`packages/workflows`](./packages/workflows/README.md), and the Atomic-branded coding-agent fork lives at [`packages/coding-agent`](./packages/coding-agent/README.md).

---

## Prerequisites

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) ≥ 22.13** — runs installs, checks, and the vitest suites (`node:sqlite` is unflagged from 22.13)
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.4.2** — compiles release binaries, runs `scripts/*.ts`, and hosts the Bun-based test fixtures
- **[Rust](https://rustup.rs)** (stable, with `cargo`) — builds the `@bastani/atomic-natives` N-API module
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — Python package/environment manager for the `evals/` harness
- **Docker** — required for local Pier/DeepSWE sandbox runs

This repo runs a hybrid toolchain matching upstream `earendil-works/pi`: **npm** installs, builds, checks, and runs the vitest suites; **Bun** compiles the release binaries, runs `scripts/*.ts`, and hosts the test fixtures that need it. `AGENTS.md` carries the full table. The `@bastani/workflows` workspace package ships raw `.ts` files with no build step; Atomic bundles it into `@bastani/atomic` during the coding-agent build.

---

## Setup

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:bastani-inc/atomic.git
cd atomic
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run build
```

`npm run build` is a required one-time step (and again after pulling changes to
`packages/ai`, `packages/coding-agent`, `crates/`, or `packages/natives/`). It
builds the vendored `@bastani/pi-ai` package (including a models.dev catalog
refresh), aliases `node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-ai` onto that workspace copy,
builds the native N-API module, and builds `@bastani/atomic` with its bundled
package assets. `npm ci --ignore-scripts`
deliberately skips lifecycle scripts (including the `prepare` hook that would
run the alias), and the workspace packages have no install hooks anyway — only
published releases ship prebuilt artifacts. Without the pi-ai build, running the
CLI from source fails with `Cannot find module '@bastani/pi-ai'`.

**`vitest` now builds it for you when it is missing.** The `globalSetup` in
`test/global-setup-natives.ts` checks for `packages/natives/native/*.node`
before collecting any file: present and current, it returns after one stat and
costs nothing; missing, it prints what it is doing and runs the build; older
than the Rust sources, it warns and runs anyway, because `git checkout` rewrites
mtimes and blocking a suite on that evidence is worse than one build too few.
You still need a Rust toolchain — without cargo it fails with that prerequisite
rather than a compile error.

Running the CLI is not covered by that, so build it yourself before using the
agent from a fresh checkout. Without the compiled binding, `pty:true` bash falls
back to pipes and native grep/find/tree-sitter block resolution fall back to
slower JS paths.

What is **not** a graceful degradation is the test suites. Since the in-process
subagent runner landed, `packages/subagents` reaches the Rust control plane
through a *static* import, so a missing binding throws while the module graph is
still loading and takes roughly twenty root unit and integration files with it —
not just `bash-pty-native`, `search-tool-*`, and `hashline-tools`. The errors
name whatever imported the extension, such as `workflow-stage-bundled-resources`,
so the failure reads like a regression in an unrelated subsystem. CI builds the
module explicitly for the same reason (see `.github/workflows/test.yml`).

Note that the generated napi-rs loader's own miss message suggests removing
`package-lock.json` and `node_modules` and re-running `npm i`. That advice does
not apply here: with `--ignore-scripts`, reinstalling never produces the
binding. `npm run build` (or `npm run build --workspace=@bastani/atomic-natives`) is the fix.

The committed `.npmrc` applies a three-day minimum release age to anything you add with
`npm install`, and pins exact versions. `package-lock.json` is the only lockfile.

If you cloned without submodules, initialize them before running evals or touching vendored benchmark harnesses:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Current submodules include `evals/deep-swe` and `evals/vendor/pier`; the evals package points `datacurve-pier` at the local editable `evals/vendor/pier` checkout.

The eval harness is Python-based and uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) from the `evals/` directory:

```bash
cd evals
uv sync
uv run python -c 'import pier, pathlib; print(pathlib.Path(pier.__file__).resolve())'
uv run pier --help
```

The `pier` import should resolve to `evals/vendor/pier/src/pier/__init__.py`. After pulling submodule pointer changes or local Pier edits, refresh the editable install with:

```bash
cd evals
uv sync --reinstall-package datacurve-pier
```

Example single-task DeepSWE run with Atomic and the local Pier checkout. See
[`evals/README.md`](./evals/README.md) for the full runbook:

```bash
cd evals
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
uv run pier run \
  -p deep-swe/tasks \
  --agent-import-path atomic_pier:Atomic \
  --model openrouter/openai/gpt-5.5 \
  --agent-kwarg thinking=xhigh \
  --agent-kwarg version=0.9.13 \
  --agent-env 'OPENROUTER_API_KEY=${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}' \
  --n-tasks 1 \
  --sample-seed 0 \
  --n-concurrent 1 \
  --force-build
```

Pin a concrete `version=`. A moving tag cannot be attributed to a build after
the fact, and the adapters pass the task after `--`, which Atomic only accepts
from 0.9.11 — an older build starts with no task at all and collects an empty
patch.

### The Pier pin is the benchmark's guarantee

`evals/vendor/pier` points at [`bastani-inc/pier`](https://github.com/bastani-inc/pier)
`main`: upstream plus Atomic commits that (a) set `extra="forbid"` on the
task-config models, so a `task.toml` key Pier cannot model raises instead of
being silently dropped, (b) honor verifier-scoped `network_mode`, which the
corpus declares and upstream ignored, and (c) error a trial whose `model.patch`
never arrived or arrived empty, instead of recording it as completed.

A checkout that drifted off the pin, or is dirty, does not have those:

```bash
git submodule status        # a leading + means drifted, - means uninitialized
git status --short evals/   # local edits inside a submodule
```

To change the fork: push to `bastani-inc/pier` `main`, then move the gitlink and
refresh the editable install.

```bash
git -C evals/vendor/pier push origin HEAD:main
git add evals/vendor/pier
cd evals && uv sync --reinstall-package datacurve-pier
```

`npm install` runs the root `prepare` script, which installs Git hooks with [`prek`](https://prek.j178.dev/) from [`prek.toml`](./prek.toml). The hook shims installed by default come from `default_install_hook_types`; currently that is `pre-commit`. To reinstall hooks manually, run `npm run hooks:install`. Set `PREK_DISABLE_INSTALL=1` to skip hook installation for a local install; CI skips it automatically.

The root `package.json` is a private workspace package named `atomic-monorepo`. The only publishable package is `packages/coding-agent` (`@bastani/atomic`); other `packages/*` workspaces are bundled or internal.

---

## Running the Atomic coding-agent from source

The `packages/coding-agent` package is the Atomic-branded fork of pi's coding-agent CLI. In this repo its CLI name is `atomic`, its config directory is `~/.atomic/agent`, and its environment variable prefix is `ATOMIC_`.

For most local development, run the TypeScript entrypoint directly with Bun from the workspace root:

```bash
bun packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts --help
bun packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts
```

For a one-shot non-interactive prompt:

```bash
bun packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts -p "List files in this repo"
```

The direct source command is the recommended dev loop because it avoids generating `dist/` and resolves package assets from `src/`.

If you need to exercise the compiled package layout, use the coding-agent watch script in one terminal:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/coding-agent dev
```

After the first emit, run the compiled CLI from another terminal. The published
`atomic` bin runs under `#!/usr/bin/env node`, so `node` is the faithful way to
exercise the compiled layout; `bun` works too:

```bash
node packages/coding-agent/dist/cli.js --help
node packages/coding-agent/dist/cli.js
```

To run the development CLI against a different working directory while keeping source in this checkout:

```bash
cd /path/to/target/project
bun /path/to/atomic/packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts
```

For a production-style build, run:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/coding-agent build
node packages/coding-agent/dist/cli.js --version
```

Both the source and dist entrypoints pick up the native module from
`packages/natives/native/`; if you skipped the natives build in Setup, PTY and
native search quietly fall back to slower JS paths.

---

## Local dev loop with atomic

The extension entrypoint is now:

```text
packages/workflows/src/extension/index.ts
```

Three options, from heaviest to lightest:

### A. `atomic plugin install` against the local package path (persisted)

```bash
atomic plugin install -l "$PWD/packages/workflows"   # project-local
# or
atomic plugin install    "$PWD/packages/workflows"   # global
```

atomic adds the absolute package path to its settings file and resolves the package's `atomic` manifest. From inside atomic, `/reload` re-imports the extension after you edit source — no restart needed.

### B. One-off load with `-e` (no settings write)

```bash
atomic -e "$PWD/packages/workflows/src/extension/index.ts"
```

The fastest iteration loop. Combine with `--no-extensions` to isolate the extension under test:

```bash
atomic --no-extensions \
   -e "$PWD/packages/workflows/src/extension/index.ts" \
   "/workflow list"
```

### C. Symlink into the extensions directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.atomic/agent/extensions
ln -s "$PWD/packages/workflows" ~/.atomic/agent/extensions/workflows
```

Useful when you want the extension persisted globally but don't want atomic to track it in settings.

## Commands

Run these from the workspace root:

| Command                    | Description                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm ci --ignore-scripts`   | Install from `package-lock.json`                                 |
| `npm run build`             | Refresh and compile `@bastani/pi-ai`, alias `@earendil-works/pi-ai` onto it, build the native N-API module, and build `@bastani/atomic` with bundled assets (requires cargo and network) |
| `npm run build --workspace=@bastani/atomic-natives` | Build only the native N-API module              |
| `npm run check`             | Typecheck plus the published-shrinkwrap check                    |
| `npm run typecheck`         | Type-check the workspace                                         |
| `npm run test:unit`         | Run unit tests                                                   |
| `npm run test:integration`  | Run integration tests                                            |
| `npm run test:ci-contracts` | Run the CI and release contract suite                            |
| `npm run test:all`          | Run both unit + integration                                      |
| `npm run test:scripts`      | `node --test scripts/*.test.mjs`                                 |
| `npm run test --workspace=@bastani/atomic`     | The coding-agent suite, under Node              |
| `npm run test:bun --workspace=@bastani/atomic` | Its Bun-hosted half; both are required          |
| `npm run hooks:install`     | Install `prek.toml` Git hooks using `default_install_hook_types` |
| `npm run hooks:run`         | Run all `prek.toml` hooks across the repository                  |

`check` runs `biome check --error-on-warnings`, then `tsc --noEmit`, then the coding-agent
package's own typecheck (`tsgo -p tsconfig.build.json --noEmit` — a second pass under a
different compiler and a stricter config, including `erasableSyntaxOnly`, because the root
tsconfig excludes `packages/coding-agent`), then verifies
`packages/coding-agent/npm-shrinkwrap.json` is still derivable from `package-lock.json`; `lint`
is an alias for `check`, and `npm run format` applies Biome's formatter. Biome is configured in
[`biome.json`](./biome.json) with upstream pi's rule set.
Git hook configuration lives in [`prek.toml`](./prek.toml), not `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

---

## Testing patterns

All suites run under **vitest** with `node:assert/strict` assertions.

Because the suites run under Node, `Bun.*` and `import.meta.dir` are unavailable in tests.
`test/helpers/runtime.ts` provides the replacements (`sleep`, `readText`, `readJson`,
`fileExists`, `writeFileEnsuringDir`, `spawnSyncCollect`, `spawnProcess`, `moduleDir`,
`bunExecutable`); several close traps a direct port would not, so use them rather than
reaching for `node:fs` or `node:child_process`. See `AGENTS.md` for the table.

One exception: four files in `packages/coding-agent/test` are collected by a **Bun-hosted**
vitest project (`agent-bun`) and run by `npm run test:bun --workspace=@bastani/atomic`. They
test `src/core/tools/resource-selectors.ts`, which loads `bun:sqlite` and throws without it,
so under Node they do not fail — they stop asserting. Do not add a runtime guard that returns
early; add the file to `BUN_HOSTED_TESTS` in `packages/coding-agent/vitest.config.ts`
instead. `test/ci/ci-workflow-contracts.test.ts` enforces both halves.

### Unit tests (`test/unit/*.test.ts`)

Pure-TS tests against modules in `packages/workflows/src/`. They mock pi's `ExtensionAPI` surface with hand-built fakes — fast, deterministic, no pi runtime in the loop.

Run: `npm run test:unit`.

### Integration tests (`test/integration/*.test.ts`)

Higher-fidelity tests that compose multiple modules (runtime, wiring, overlay) and exercise the extension factory against a structural mock of `ExtensionAPI`. Still no real pi process — but they cover end-to-end registration, lifecycle, and overlay paths.

Run: `npm run test:integration`.

### Improved coverage with pi's SDK

pi exposes `DefaultResourceLoader.extensionFactories` for in-process extension injection:

```ts
import {
    createAgentSession,
    DefaultResourceLoader,
    SessionManager,
    getAgentDir,
} from "@bastani/atomic";
import factory from "./packages/workflows/src/extension/index.ts";

const resourceLoader = new DefaultResourceLoader({
    cwd: process.cwd(),
    agentDir: getAgentDir(),
    extensionFactories: [factory],
});
await resourceLoader.reload();

const { session } = await createAgentSession({
    resourceLoader,
    sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
});
```

## Running examples

```bash
bun examples/hello-world.ts
bun examples/parallel-fan-out.ts
```

Examples import the workspace package `@bastani/workflows`.

## Best practices

- **Source files use `.js` import extensions** (TypeScript ESM convention). The repo ships as `.ts` files; Bun resolves `.js` specifiers to `.ts` sources directly.
- **Avoid `any` and `unknown`.** Use specific types. The codebase compiles with `strict`, `noUnusedLocals`, and `noUnusedParameters`.
- **Keep the root package private.** The only publishable workspace package is `packages/coding-agent` (`@bastani/atomic`).
- **Keep `packages/workflows` private.** It is bundled into `@bastani/atomic`; do not publish it independently.
- **Do not add a build step** for `@bastani/workflows`; it ships raw TypeScript/resources into the Atomic bundle.
- **Track in-progress fixes in `issues.md`.** Delete the file once issues are resolved.

---

## Releasing

Atomic uses a **versionless release-base** flow: `main` and supported workstreams stay at the `0.0.0` placeholder, while the real version is materialized only on a throwaway `Release <version>` commit whose parent is the selected exact remote branch SHA. Pushing the `<version>` tag (no leading `v`, for example `0.8.24` or `0.8.24-alpha.1`) directly starts `.github/workflows/publish.yml`. Its lightweight integrity job checks the tag/package version and `Release <version>` subject before same-run native and archive builds, draft GitHub Release staging, OIDC npm publication, and final undrafting. See [Direct release trigger and recovery](./docs/ci.md#direct-release-trigger-and-recovery).

### Workflow

1. Land the CHANGELOG move on the selected versionless base like any other change: move the `[Unreleased]` section in `packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md` into a new `## [<version>] - <YYYY-MM-DD>` section (CI extracts release notes from it). **Do not bump any `package.json` version.**
2. From a clean selected base, cut the release. This resolves the exact remote branch, stamps the version onto a detached `Release <version>` commit, records `Release-base-ref` and `Release-base-sha`, tags it, and pushes only the tag:
    ```sh
    bun run scripts/cut-release.ts <version> --base main --push
    ```
    The selected branch is never advanced; the script does the stamp in a detached git worktree and abandons it (the tag keeps the commit alive). Omit `--push` to inspect the tag locally first, then `git push origin <version>`. A non-main base must be protected with the repository's required CI checks before it is used.
3. The tag push starts `.github/workflows/publish.yml` directly. It validates the tag identity, rebuilds all native bindings and release archives, stages a verified draft GitHub Release, publishes npm packages through OIDC, and undrafts the GitHub Release only after npm succeeds. Configure npm trusted publishers with workflow filename `publish.yml` and environment `npm-publish`.

To run the full guarded automation (release-notes PR + cut-release + publish monitoring), use the `publish-release` Atomic workflow instead of the manual steps above.

Bun is the development/test/runtime path. **npm is still the registry publication tool** because npm's provenance flow signs the published tarball via OIDC. CI uses trusted publishing without a static npm credential.

---

## CI

CI runs static checks, the root unit/integration suites, the coding-agent suite, and release-archive smoke tests as concurrent jobs behind a fail-closed result gate, on Linux and Windows. It builds `@bastani/atomic-natives` explicitly before the suites. See [docs/ci.md](./docs/ci.md) and `.github/workflows/test.yml`.
