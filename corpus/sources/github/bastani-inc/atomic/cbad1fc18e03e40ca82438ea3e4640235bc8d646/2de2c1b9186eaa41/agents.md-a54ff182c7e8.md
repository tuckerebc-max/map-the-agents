# Development Rules

## Overview

This repo is the private `atomic-monorepo` npm workspace. It currently houses:

- `@bastani/atomic` in `packages/coding-agent` — the Atomic-branded fork of pi's coding-agent CLI and the only independently published package.
- `@bastani/workflows` in `packages/workflows` — a first-party extension for Atomic/pi that brings multi-stage, DAG-driven workflow execution to agent sessions.
- `@bastani/subagents` in `packages/subagents` — builtin subagent orchestration, reusable agent definitions, skills, prompts, and foreground/background execution.
- `@bastani/mcp` in `packages/mcp` — builtin MCP adapter extension that exposes MCP servers as agent tools.
- `@bastani/web-access` in `packages/web-access` — builtin web search, URL fetching, GitHub repository, PDF, and video extraction tools.
- `@bastani/intercom` in `packages/intercom` — builtin coordination channel for parent/child and cross-session agent communication.

Companion packages under `packages/*` ship as **raw TypeScript** (no compile step) and are bundled into `@bastani/atomic` at build time rather than published independently. The coding-agent package follows upstream pi's compiled-package layout.

## Tech Stack

This repo runs a **hybrid toolchain, matching upstream `earendil-works/pi` task for task**.
Each tool is used where it is actually better, rather than one runtime being mandated
everywhere. Where the split differs from pi, the reason is written down.

| Task | Tool | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dependency install | `npm ci --ignore-scripts` | `package-lock.json` is the single verified lockfile. `npm ci` refuses to install when it and `package.json` disagree; nothing enforced that while two lockfiles coexisted |
| Install policy | committed `.npmrc` | `save-exact=true` matches pi. **`min-release-age=0` deliberately diverges** from pi's 2: Atomic adopts pi releases the same day they publish, which a nonzero cooldown blocks by construction. `.github/dependabot.yml` carries the matching `cooldown: 0`; the two must move together |
| Build | `npm run build` | TypeScript 7 `tsc`, not Bun; no behaviour change |
| Lint / format | `biome check` (`npm run check`, `npm run format`) | pi's rule set exactly: recommended preset plus the same six overrides. Tab indent width 3, line width 120 |
| Typecheck / check | `npm run check` (biome + `tsc --noEmit` + the coding-agent package's `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json --noEmit` + shrinkwrap check) | pi runs biome + TypeScript 7 `tsc` here. The second typecheck pass covers `packages/coding-agent`, which the root tsconfig excludes, under its own stricter build config (including `erasableSyntaxOnly`) |
| Root test suites | `vitest --run --project {unit,integration,ci}` | pi uses vitest for its workspace tests, with a shared `vitest.base.ts` setting only `resolve.alias` |
| `packages/coding-agent` suite | `vitest --run` | already parity; it now runs under Node rather than `bun --bun`, SQLite selectors included |
| Script tests | `node --test scripts/*.test.mjs` | pi parity. Scripts Node can run are tested with Node's own runner |
| Repository scripts | `bun run scripts/*.ts` | Bun executes `.ts` directly and resolves `.js` specifiers to `.ts` source with no loader hook. Bare `node` cannot; scripts meant for `node --test` are `.mjs` |
| Binary compilation | `bun build --compile` | Cross-compiles the single-file executables; upstream pi uses Bun for exactly this step too. Bun pinned to 1.4.2 |
| npm-package smoke tests | Node (`node-version: 22` in CI, matching pi) | `test/integration/installed-package-node-extensions.test.ts` verifies the shipped `atomic` bin under `#!/usr/bin/env node`, which is how npm installs run it |
| Registry publish | `npm publish --provenance` | npm's OIDC-signed provenance lives in the npm CLI. npm trusted publishing and provenance accept only cloud-hosted runners, so `publish.yml`'s `publish-npm` job must stay GitHub-hosted (`ubuntu-latest`): Namespace runners report `runner_environment=self-hosted` |

**Where this repository deliberately declines pi's shape:** pi's CI is one `ubuntu-latest`
job with no matrix and no `timeout-minutes`. Do not copy it. This workflow preserves
full Windows coverage, runs on Namespace runners, and carries per-job timeout budgets.
Adopting pi's topology would delete Windows coverage and orphan the required
`test (all platforms)` check. Parity is
a *toolchain* goal, not a CI-topology goal.

**CI runners:** pull-request-capable workflows (`test.yml`, `codeql.yml`) run every job on a
repository Namespace runner profile (`namespace-profile-atomic-ci-*`) whose Access Level must be
Restricted, so fork runs of the committed workflows get no usable Namespace workload token. A fork
pull request that edits `.github/workflows` runs its own `runs-on`, so maintainer approval is the
only barrier there: before approving a fork run, check the diff for `.github/` changes (see
`docs/ci.md`, "Approving fork workflow runs"). The release path
uses inline labels (`nscloud-*`) except the dedicated macOS release cache profile and
`publish-npm` on GitHub-hosted Linux (`ubuntu-latest`, required by npm trusted publishing
and provenance). Both macOS targets build on Namespace Apple Silicon; Intel artifacts
are cross-compiled and smoke-tested under Rosetta, not on native Intel hardware.
The required `test (all platforms)` gate aggregates every platform's work jobs.
`docs/ci.md` ("Runners") has the mapping, the profiles and their dashboard-only settings, the
checkout/cache trust model, and the follow-ups.

Validate CI configuration through YAML parsing, actionlint, review, and actual hosted runs.
Do not add tests that duplicate workflow YAML, including runners, matrices, cache settings,
action pins, permissions, and required checks. Keep product and executable release-tooling tests.

- TypeScript ≥ 5.x (strict, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`)
- `@sinclair/typebox` for schema definitions
- `jiti` for runtime TS loading where needed

## Quick Reference

### Commands

- `npm ci --ignore-scripts` — install dependencies from `package-lock.json`
- `npm run build` — one-time per checkout (and after pulling changes to `packages/ai`, `packages/coding-agent`, `crates/`, or `packages/natives/`): builds `@bastani/pi-ai` (fetches models.dev and writes `src/providers/data/`, then compiles), aliases `@earendil-works/pi-ai` onto it, builds the native N-API module, and builds `@bastani/atomic` with its bundled package assets. `npm ci --ignore-scripts` skips the `prepare` hook, so nothing else runs these
- `npm install <pkg>` — add a dependency; `.npmrc` applies `save-exact`. There is no release-age gate: `min-release-age=0`
- `npm run check` — `tsc --noEmit`, then the coding-agent package typecheck (`tsc -p tsconfig.build.json --noEmit`), plus the published-shrinkwrap check. `npm run typecheck` runs both typecheck passes alone
- `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`, `npm run test:ci-contracts`, `npm run test:all`
- `npm run test --workspace=@bastani/atomic` — the coding-agent vitest suite, under Node
- `npm run test:scripts` — `node --test scripts/*.test.mjs`
- `npm run hooks:install`, `npm run hooks:run`
- `bun run scripts/<name>.ts` — repository scripts stay on Bun; see the Tech Stack table
- Git hooks are configured in `prek.toml`; `npm install` runs the root `prepare` script to install hooks with `prek install --prepare-hooks` using `default_install_hook_types`.

**Do not run `yarn install` or `pnpm install`,** and do not reintroduce `bun install`: each
writes a competing lockfile that `npm ci` neither reads nor verifies, and bypasses the
`.npmrc` `save-exact` pin. `bun.lock` and `packageManager: bun@…` were removed for this
reason. Bun remains a declared engine and is still the right tool for the rows above that
name it.

## Best Practices

- Avoid ambiguous types like `any` and `unknown`. Use specific types instead.
- `@types/bun` is pinned to 1.4.1 while the Bun runtime/CI pin is 1.4.2: `@types/bun@1.4.2` is not yet published. bun-types 1.4.1 restores generic `off`/`removeListener` overloads on `NodeJS.Process` (oven-sh/bun#40003), resolving the `memoryPressure` shadowing that required the previous 1.3.14 compatibility pin. Both repository typecheck passes succeed with 1.4.1; verify with `npm run typecheck` when bumping types.
- Source files use `.js` import extensions (TypeScript ESM convention). The repo ships as `.ts` files; Bun resolves `.js` specifiers to the underlying `.ts` source directly — no loader hook required. atomic's loader follows the same convention as pi.
- Do not add a build step (`dist/`, `tsconfig.build.json`, etc.) to `packages/workflows`; it distributes raw TypeScript and the host loads it directly. `packages/coding-agent` is copied from upstream pi and keeps its existing build setup.
- When using skills, if you see a frontmatter of `metadata: internal` set to `true` (if missing assume `false`), that means the skill is for internal developers of this package. If this flag is omitted, the skill is meant for consumers/everyday users.

## Design Context

Refer to `DESIGN.md` and `PRODUCT.md`.

## Issues and pull requests

Follow [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for external-contributor coordination, issue assignment, and pull request guidance.

## Testing

Use `npm run test:unit` (or `test:integration`, `test:all`) and make use of your tdd skill to write high quality tests. The suites run under **vitest**; the assertion style stays `node:assert/strict`:

```ts#test/unit/index.test.ts
import { test } from "vitest";
import assert from "node:assert/strict";

test("hello world", () => {
  assert.equal(1, 1);
});
```

For regression tests that fix a GitHub issue, put the issue number in the test name (for example `test("keeps cwd on resume (#123)", …)`) rather than in a comment.

### Replacing Bun globals in tests

Root suites run under Node, so `Bun.*` and `import.meta.dir` are unavailable. Use
`test/helpers/runtime.ts` rather than reaching for `node:fs`/`node:child_process` directly —
several of the replacements differ in ways that fail silently:

| Bun | Helper | Trap it closes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Bun.sleep` | `sleep` | — |
| `import.meta.dir` | `moduleDir(import.meta.url)` | — |
| `Bun.file(p).text()/.json()/.exists()` | `readText` / `readJson` / `fileExists` | `readJson<T>()` returns `unknown` by default; `Bun.file().json()` returned `any` |
| `Bun.write` | `writeFileEnsuringDir` | `Bun.write` creates parent directories; `fs.writeFile` throws ENOENT |
| `Bun.spawnSync` | `spawnSyncCollect` | Node returns `status`, not `exitCode`; a raw port makes every `assert.equal(r.exitCode, 0)` compare against `undefined` |
| `Bun.spawn` | `spawnProcess` | Node has no `.exited` promise and no web-stream stdio, and reports a missing binary asynchronously rather than throwing |
| `process.execPath` **when spawning Bun** | `bunExecutable()` | Under vitest `process.execPath` is Node, so a `.ts` child, `bun run`, or a Bun-specific `-e` script silently runs under the wrong runtime |

Shipped `packages/` code that uses `Bun.*` behind `isBunBinary`/`isBundledBuild` is **out of
scope** and must not be edited to suit the test runner. One shipped module —
`packages/web-access/subprocess.ts` — calls `Bun.spawn`/`Bun.sleep` *unguarded*, because it
only ever runs inside the Bun-compiled binary. `test/unit/web-access-subprocess.test.ts`
therefore calls `installBunGlobal()`, which substitutes the helpers above for those two
globals. All five test names and their assertions survive, and what they cover — bounded
draining, the byte cap, the timeout, the kill path — is unchanged. **What they no longer
cover is Bun's own spawn implementation, which is what the shipped binary runs on.** The
alternative, re-execing the file under Bun, would collapse five names into one wrapper
assertion; that is a worse trade, but the gap is real and is stated here rather than only in
the helper.

### SQLite selectors use node:sqlite on either runtime

`src/core/tools/resource-selectors.ts` loads `node:sqlite`, which Node ≥ 22.13 and
Bun ≥ 1.4.2 (this repository's Bun floor) both ship. Bun introduced it in 1.4.0
(oven-sh/bun#32498), when the `bun:sqlite` fallback for older Bun binaries was
removed; do not reintroduce it.

`better-sqlite3` was evaluated and rejected: it segfaults Bun 1.3.14 on construction, which is
worse than a catchable missing-module error.

Test fixtures go through `packages/coding-agent/test/helpers/sqlite.ts`, which wraps
`node:sqlite` behind the `bun:sqlite`-shaped API the suites were written against. Never
reintroduce a soft guard (`if (!sqlite) return`, or a `? it : it.skip`) — that is how one test
skipped and eleven kept passing with every assertion dead. `test/ci/ci-workflow-contracts.test.ts`
enforces the node:sqlite-only loader and rejects those guards.


### Per-test timeout policy

- The global per-test timeout is **30000 ms**, declared once as `TEST_TIMEOUT_MS` in `test/helpers/test-timeout.ts` and applied by the root `vitest.config.ts` to all three projects. Vitest enforces this timeout; explicit per-test budgets override it.
- Do **not** restate the budget in a package script, in `.github/workflows/test.yml`, or in `bunfig.toml`.
- One platform-neutral value, never a Windows-only branch. A Windows-only bump would leave Linux as the only place the budget is enforced and hide Windows regressions until they were far worse. (`packages/coding-agent/vitest.config.ts` keeps its own pre-existing 90 s Windows branch, local to that project.)
- Add an explicit third-argument timeout only for a test whose cost is *structural* (a full builtin-package loader reload, a real CLI child process, a real `vitest` child, a `tsc` invocation, a built-package install). **Name the constant and keep it at the call site** — `REAL_VITEST_SUITE_TIMEOUT_MS` in `test/unit/test-suite-runner.test.ts` is the pattern; a bare `120_000` says nothing about why the cost is structural rather than a slow test nobody fixed. Never restate the default value — an explicit timeout that merely repeats it silently lowers that test's budget when the default rises.
- `scripts/run-test-suite.ts` runs each CI suite exactly once and propagates test failures, including actual Vitest timeouts. Duration headroom is **warning-only** at 40% of each test's effective budget: there is no separate 70% failure threshold. Keep whole-job timeouts for hangs outside individual tests.
- The wrapper always writes `.ci-diagnostics/<suite>-durations.md`, including on successful runs. It reads Vitest's JSON reporter alongside the readable default reporter. Missing, unreadable, or duration-less reports when tests ran remain harness failures, not passing runs.
- Budget resolution follows the selected Vitest project and explicit per-test overrides. Unsupported commands leave headroom warnings disabled. Explicit budgets are matched by fully qualified `scope > name`.
- Keep `WARN_RATIO` at 40% so slow tests remain visible. Warnings are diagnostic, not a reason to increase budgets merely to silence them.

### Load sensitivity

vitest runs test *files* in parallel by default, and this repository deliberately sets no
`pool`, `maxWorkers`, `poolOptions`, or `fileParallelism` — pi sets none either. A test that
only passes on an idle machine is a bug in that test. Fix it where it lives: give the real
work headroom and derive the assertion from a named constant (see `STALLED_ATTEMPT_CAP_MS` in
`test/unit/subagents-attempt-watchdog-helpers.ts`). Do not skip it, do not serialize the
suite, and do not shard to hide load-sensitive failures.

### Hook name compatibility

Use `beforeAll`/`afterAll` for once-per-suite setup/teardown and `beforeEach`/`afterEach` for
per-test hooks. `before`/`after` are not exported.

### Code Quality

- Frequently run `npm run check` (typecheck plus the shrinkwrap check). `npm run typecheck` is the typecheck alone.
- Avoid `any` and `unknown` types.
- Modularize code and avoid re-inventing the wheel. Use functionality of libraries and SDKs whenever possible.
- In `packages/coding-agent`, resolve package assets through helpers in `src/config.ts`. Do not use `__dirname` directly; the helpers account for source checkouts, npm installations, and standalone binaries.

## Debugging

You are bound to run into errors when testing. As you test and run into issues/edge cases, address issues in a file you create called `issues.md` to track progress and support future iterations. Delegate to the debugging sub-agent for support. Delete the file when all issues are resolved to keep the repository clean.

### Coding Agent Configuration Location

atomic:

- global:
    - Linux/MacOS: `~/.atomic/agent/`
    - Windows: `%HOMEPATH%\.atomic\agent\\`
- extensions: `~/.atomic/agent/extensions/<name>/`
- local: `.atomic/` in the project directory

## Releasing

Atomic uses a **versionless release-base** flow: supported bases keep `packages/*/package.json` at `0.0.0`; `scripts/cut-release.ts` materializes the real version only on a tagged detached `Release <version>` commit with harmless immutable `Release-base-ref`/`Release-base-sha` trailers. Pushing the version tag directly starts `publish.yml`. Its lightweight integrity job checks that the source resolves to the tag commit, `packages/coding-agent/package.json` equals the tag, and the subject is `Release <version>`. Build jobs produce and smoke-test native modules and archives; a draft GitHub Release is staged before OIDC-only npm publication and undrafted only after npm succeeds. `publish-npm` and `register-published-version` receive `id-token: write`; release staging, undrafting, and failed-draft cleanup alone receive `contents: write`. Configure npm trusted publishers with filename `publish.yml` and environment `npm-publish`.

Cut and publish a release with:

```sh
bun run scripts/cut-release.ts 0.8.31 --base main --push
```

The selected base is never advanced by the version stamp. The script resolves its exact `refs/heads/...` ref on `origin`, creates the release commit in a detached git worktree, records the base trailers, tags it, and abandons the worktree. The tag push is the publication signal. The publisher deliberately does not validate or allowlist those trailers; its integrity boundary is the tag/package-version/commit-subject match.

### Agent publishing requests

If a user asks to publish a release or prerelease, route the request through the repository-local `publish-release` Atomic workflow:

1. Ask for the version only when it was not supplied. Stable releases use `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`; prereleases use `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-alpha.REVISION` with revision starting at 1.
2. Infer release versus prerelease from a valid supplied version; ask only when it is ambiguous or invalid. Use the requested `base_ref`, defaulting to the short branch name `main` when omitted.
3. For non-main bases, require the branch to be protected with the repository's required CI checks before using it as the selected release base.
4. Launch one `publish-release` workflow run with `target_version`, `release_kind`, and `base_ref`. Do not duplicate its Git, PR, tag, or publishing actions inline.
5. A durable preflight first requires a clean worktree, then either proves that no release branch or PR exists and allows changelog preparation, or reuses one exact changelog-only commit and matching open PR. Commit inspection exhausts every GitHub file page and checks both sides of renamed paths. Conflicting worktree, base, files, commit, branch, local/remote SHA, or PR identity stops the run; the workflow never resets or force-pushes reuse state.
6. The workflow discovers exact required contexts and app identities from branch protection and active rulesets. Only the classic unprotected-branch status-check lookup may be absent; ruleset lookup errors fail closed. Configured checks that have not materialized remain pending. An empty configured set, identity drift, failed check, GitHub/auth error, abort, or the 45-minute bound stops the run; only all exact checks passing or the exact PR being admin-merged proceeds.
7. After the gate passes, it merges the exact verified PR head, switches to the selected base, and fast-forwards from `origin/<base_ref>`.
8. It runs `bun run scripts/cut-release.ts <version> --base <base_ref> --push --yes`, which stamps only the detached release commit and pushes the tag. That tag push automatically starts `publish.yml`; the workflow does not manually dispatch normal publication.
9. A durable gate polls for the exact `bastani-inc/atomic` push run at `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, matching tag and release SHA. A delayed run stays pending; identity drift, command/auth failure, a non-success conclusion, abort, or the 60-minute bound stops the run.

## Docs

- ALWAYS keep the user-facing docs in `packages/coding-agent/docs` up-to-date with the latest changes after you make changes. Prefer to keep other docs up-to-date as well, but the coding-agent docs are the most important since they are user-facing and often consulted by users and other agents.
- `packages/coding-agent/docs` is user-facing documentation. Explain how to use, configure, and troubleshoot Atomic. Do not include internal implementation details, test infrastructure, debugging histories, verification evidence, or maintainer-only design notes. Keep those in repository-level docs or PR descriptions. Keep user guides concise and focused on what users need to know.
- Update user guides only when a change affects how users use, configure, or troubleshoot Atomic. An internal optimization does not require a guide edit merely to say that something is faster, uses less CPU, or needs no configuration. If there is no actionable user guidance, leave the guide unchanged. Put user-visible performance improvements in the package changelog and measurements or implementation rationale in repository-level notes or the PR description.
- To update docs, prefer using your `release-docs` workflow to thoroughly update all relevant docs with the latest changes. If you need to make a quick fix or update, you can also edit the markdown files directly, but make sure to keep them comprehensive and up-to-date.

## Changelog

Location: `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` (each package has its own)

### Format

Use these sections under `## [Unreleased]`:

- `### Breaking Changes` - API changes requiring migration
- `### Added` - New features
- `### Changed` - Changes to existing functionality
- `### Fixed` - Bug fixes
- `### Removed` - Removed features

### Rules

- Changelogs are user-facing release notes. Record only changes to shipped package
  behavior: APIs, features, user-visible fixes. CI, release/publish pipelines,
  repository automation, maintainer scripts, and agent instructions are infrastructure
  and get no entry unless they also change what users get.
- New entries go under `## [Unreleased]`, appended to the existing subsection for their
  kind. Read the whole section first; do not create a second `### Fixed`.
- A released section (`## [0.12.2]`) is immutable. Do not edit, append to, or delete
  one. `test/unit/changelog.test.ts` compares each against its tag.
- A release section (`## [0.9.19]`) lists every entry from the prereleases that led to
  it (`0.9.19-alpha.1` through `0.9.19-alpha.12`), grouped under the standard
  subsections. It must stand alone: the GitHub release page shows only that section.
- Do not open a section with a preamble that names the prereleases it covers and
  redirects the reader, e.g. "Cumulative release of the `0.9.19-alpha.1` through
  `0.9.19-alpha.12` prereleases. Per-change details remain in the prerelease sections
  below." `scripts/build-release-notes.ts` merges one preamble per package, so this
  stacks eight redirections above the first real entry.
- Each entry says what changed for the user. "Bumped package version for the Atomic
  prerelease" is not an entry.

### Attribution

- **From an issue**: `Fixed foo bar ([#123](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/123))`
- **External contribution**: `Added feature X ([#456](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/pull/456) by [@username](https://github.com/username))`

## Versionless release bases & bumping

`main` and supported workstream bases are versionless: every `packages/*/package.json` (plus `package-lock.json` workspace entries, the `@bastani/atomic-natives` dependency pin, `packages/natives/native/index.js` checks, and the Cargo manifests/lock) stays at the `0.0.0` placeholder. **Do not bump the version on a release base.**

`scripts/bump-version.ts` is the low-level stamper that rewrites every versioned manifest. It is invoked by `scripts/cut-release.ts` inside a throwaway worktree at the exact remote base SHA to materialize the real version on the tagged release commit. You normally never run it directly against a release base; the only direct use is resetting the placeholder if it ever drifts:

```sh
# stamp a real version onto the off-base tag commit (preferred; explicit base shown)
bun run scripts/cut-release.ts 0.1.0 --base main
bun run scripts/cut-release.ts 0.1.0-alpha.1 --base main

# low-level: reset main back to the versionless placeholder
bun run scripts/bump-version.ts 0.0.0 && npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts
```

## CI

An overview of CI is described here: [CI Docs](docs/ci.md).

Note: npm provenance publishing uses GitHub OIDC trusted publishing and must not configure a static npm credential.

## Tips

1. The workflows extension is bundled into `@bastani/atomic`. For local development against upstream pi, symlink `packages/workflows` into `~/.pi/agent/extensions/workflows` if you want host-level discovery outside Atomic.
2. Rely on agent skills to provide information on best practices during implementation. Here is a short list of Agent Skills that are incredibly relevant to this project that you should try to use when applicable:
    - bun
    - gh-commit
    - gh-create-pr
    - prek
    - typescript-advanced-types
    - typescript-expert
3. Ask for clarity if you are unsure about a change. The developer is your best friend and oftentimes can clarify intent.
4. When modifying this extension, follow pi's extension and SDK conventions.

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
`@bastani/workflows` ships raw `.ts` files with no build step — do NOT introduce `dist/`, `tsconfig.build.json`, `outDir`, or any bundling.

Install with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, and add dependencies with `npm install`. Never run
`yarn install` or `pnpm install`, and do not bring back `bun install`: each writes a competing
lockfile that `npm ci` neither reads nor verifies, and bypasses the `save-exact` pin in the
committed `.npmrc`. `package-lock.json` is the only lockfile, and it is also the input to the
shrinkwrap published inside `@bastani/atomic`. Note that `min-release-age=0`: nothing delays a
freshly published version from entering that lockfile, and the shrinkwrap ships to users.

Bun is still required, and still correct, for three things: compiling release binaries with
`bun build --compile`, running `scripts/*.ts`, and running the Bun-hosted test fixtures. See
the Tech Stack table for the full split.
