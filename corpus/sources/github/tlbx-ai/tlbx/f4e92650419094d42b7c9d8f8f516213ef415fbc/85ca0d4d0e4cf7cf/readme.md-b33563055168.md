# Persistent terminals and coding agents in any browser.

tlbx lets you use your computer's terminals and coding agents from a browser. Install it on your Windows, macOS or Linux machine, then open it from your desktop, tablet or phone. Your tools keep running when you close the browser or switch devices, as long as the host stays awake and online.

Run Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, your usual shell, tests and dev servers in separate sessions. See files, Git changes and your app preview beside the work. tlbx is free and open source; your agent provider's usual charges still apply.

## Product screenshots

Follow agent conversations, review changes and check the running app in one browser tab.

## Two session types, one workspace

| Session type | Use it for | What tlbx renders |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------------- |
| **Terminal Session** | Shells, command-line agents, editors, tests and servers | Your usual terminal, with output retained on the host |
| **Agent Controller Session** | Supported coding agents | A conversation view with tool calls, code changes, questions and approval buttons |

Choose the session type when you launch a tool. Both share the sidebar, files, Git view and app preview. [See supported agents](https://tlbx.ai/agent-controller).

## Any shell, any terminal app

Use **PowerShell, bash or zsh**, and terminal apps such as `btop`, `vim`, `lazygit` and database shells. Split sessions into panes to watch a build, edit files and run commands side by side.

## Working with coding agents

Keep several agents running and make their work easier to follow:

- **Organize sessions:** name, split, reorder and bookmark agents, shells and servers.
- **Send screenshots:** `Ctrl+V` / `Cmd+V` uploads an image and gives the terminal its file path. Agent Controller adds it as an attachment.
- **Write longer prompts:** use multiline input, saved drafts, file attachments and scheduled follow-ups.
- **Reuse input:** open **History** (`Alt+H`) to resend commands, prompts, images or files.
- **Let agents use the workspace:** the `mt` helpers let them send prompts, read terminal output and inspect or control the app preview.
- **Check the result:** open your app beside the agent, try different window sizes and inspect screenshots or browser logs.
- **Continue elsewhere:** reconnect to the same work from another browser.

Agent Controller has built-in launch options for **Codex**, **Grok Build**, **OpenCode**, **Gemini CLI** and **GitHub Copilot CLI**. Features depend on the agent and its configured provider. You can add compatible [ACP](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) agents through `acp-agents.json`. **Claude Code** runs in a normal terminal session.

## Access your working machines

Install tlbx on each workstation or server you want to use. Open them in separate browser tabs, or connect them through tlbx's Hub. Each machine keeps its own files, tools and sessions.

## Install

Run one command on the machine where your tools should run. The installer sets up tlbx with password-protected HTTPS and updates.

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.tlbx.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
irm https://get.tlbx.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

Open the address printed by the installer. Choose service mode to start tlbx automatically after login or reboot; user mode needs no administrator access. Running programs still require the host to stay awake.

These commands install the current stable release. Add `--dev` on macOS/Linux or `-Dev` on Windows only when you explicitly want the prerelease channel.

## Private remote access

Connect your host and client devices through a trusted LAN or a private VPN such as [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/). Then open the host's private tlbx address in your browser.

Keep HTTPS and password authentication enabled. Restrict network access to the people and devices that need it, and keep tlbx and your VPN updated.

Cloudflare Tunnel, nginx/Caddy, LAN, and other private-network setups also work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Repositories, credentials and processes stay on your host. Coding agents may send data to their model provider according to their configuration and terms.

## Where things run

| Part          | Behavior                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Host**      | Your workstation or server runs tlbx and your tools |
| **Execution** | `mthost` runs terminals; `mtagenthost` runs Agent Controller sessions |
| **Client**    | A browser on your desktop, tablet or phone |
| **Lifetime**  | Sessions keep running when the browser disconnects, while the host stays awake |
| **Context**   | Files, Git changes, retained output, notes and previews belong to the session |

Closing a browser keeps sessions running. Shutting down the host stops its processes.

## Quick local trial

For a temporary local session:

```bash
npx @tlbx-ai/midterm
```

The launcher downloads the stable native binary and opens a browser. Use the native installer above for a service you can return to. The npm launcher is published separately and may lag behind native releases.

## Architecture and source

```text
browser anywhere
   ├── HTTPS / WebSocket ──► tlbx on home workstation ──► agents / repos / apps
   └── HTTPS / WebSocket ──► tlbx on office laptop ─────► agents / repos / apps
```

tlbx uses .NET 10 Native AOT, TypeScript and xterm.js.

Previously named **MidTerm**. Existing installations update in place; executable names such as `mt`, `mthost` and `mtagenthost` remain compatible.

## Security and release integrity

Report vulnerabilities through [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/tlbx-ai/tlbx/security/advisories/new), not a public issue. The [security policy](SECURITY.md) describes disclosure handling and the [support policy](SUPPORT.md) identifies the supported release lines.

Every native release archive has a matching platform-specific SPDX SBOM plus GitHub build-provenance and SBOM attestations. Installers and the built-in updater additionally verify a signed manifest and every packaged-file hash. See [Release integrity](docs/RELEASE-INTEGRITY.md) for verification commands and trust boundaries.

### Community client

[midterm-gtk](https://github.com/elsirion/midterm-gtk) is an independent,
community-maintained GTK4/libadwaita desktop client with VTE terminals. It
connects through tlbx's REST and WebSocket mux/state channels. It is
unofficial and is not maintained or support-guaranteed by the tlbx project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tlbx-ai/tlbx.git tlbx
cd tlbx
dotnet build src/Ai.Tlbx.MidTerm/Ai.Tlbx.MidTerm.csproj
```
