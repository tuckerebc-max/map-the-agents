# Models

Bandit serves a small family of first-party models behind one OpenAI-compatible
API. You pick a model with the `model` parameter on any request — there are no
weights to host, no GPUs to manage, and no upstreams to wire up. Bandit routes
each call to the right tier and keeps your data private.

> You target a **capability tier**, not a specific checkpoint. Bandit keeps the
> implementation behind each model free to improve over time, so your
> integration keeps working as the models get better underneath it.

## The lineup

| Model | Tier | Best for |
|-------|------|----------|
| `bandit-core` | Fast, general-purpose | Everyday chat, drafting, summarizing, classification, and high-volume calls where latency and cost matter most. |
| `bandit-core-2` | Advanced general-purpose | Harder general tasks that need stronger reasoning and tighter instruction-following than `bandit-core`. |
| `bandit-logic` | Reasoning | Analysis, planning, and step-by-step problem solving — tasks that reward deliberate thinking. |
| `bandit-logic-2` | Advanced reasoning &amp; coding | The most capable tier: long-horizon reasoning, agentic tool use, and code generation/editing. This is the tier behind **Bandit Stealth**. |

`bandit-core-1` is a pinned alias of `bandit-core`; use the unversioned
`bandit-core` to always track the latest of that tier.

## Choosing a model

- **Start with `bandit-core`.** It handles the majority of assistant work and is the fastest, lowest-cost option.
- **Move up to `bandit-core-2`** when answers need more depth or stricter adherence to detailed instructions.
- **Use `bandit-logic`** for problems that benefit from explicit reasoning — analysis, multi-constraint decisions, planning.
- **Use `bandit-logic-2`** for coding and agentic work: writing and refactoring code, tool-driven tasks, and anything with a long chain of steps. It powers the Bandit Stealth coding agent.

## Calling a model

The API is OpenAI-compatible — set `model` to any ID above:

```bash
curl https://api.burtson.ai/api/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BANDIT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "bandit-logic-2",
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Refactor this function and explain the change." }
    ]
  }'
```
