  # Bandit Agent Framework

  **A local-first AI coding agent — in your editor, at your terminal, or embedded in your app.**

  Your code never leaves your machine. Works with any Ollama model.

## Two hosts, one runtime

| Host | When to use | Install |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Bandit Stealth** (VS Code / Cursor) | Editing code, reviewing diffs, rich panel UI | `code --install-extension BurtsonLabs.bandit-stealth` |
| **Bandit CLI** (`bandit`) | Terminal workflows, CI, scripting, remote dev over SSH | `npm i -g bandit-stealth-cli` |

Both talk to the same [`stealth-core-runtime`](packages/stealth-core-runtime/). Skills, memory files, and hooks work identically across them.

---

## Quick start — CLI

```bash
# 1. Install Ollama and a model
brew install ollama
ollama pull gemma4:e4b              # CLI default — ~3 GB, multimodal, agent-ready

# 2. Install the CLI (curl, or npm if you prefer)
curl -fsSL https://burtson.ai/bandit-stealth-cli/install.sh | sh
# npm i -g bandit-stealth-cli

# 3. Run in any project
cd ~/my-project
bandit                              # interactive REPL
bandit "explain @src/auth.ts"       # one-shot with file mention
```

First launch:

```
╭── bandit 1.7.348 ───────────────────────────
│  ollama/gemma4:e4b  •  7 skills  •  session 20260530-091245-ab3c
╰────────────────────────────────────────────
Type /help for commands, @path to pin a file, or exit to quit.

› _
```

## Quick start — VS Code

Search **Bandit Stealth** in the Extensions panel, install, and open the side panel. The agent uses tools automatically — reading files, searching code, running commands, writing changes.

---

## Features

### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/lucide/brain.svg?color=%23a60ee5&width=22" align="absmiddle"> Skills that auto-activate

Drop a markdown skill into `.bandit/skills/` and it loads on the next turn.
Skills are context packages — YAML frontmatter for metadata, a markdown body
that becomes the playbook the agent reads when the skill activates. Triggers
are regex matches on the user prompt; skills with `activation: always` run
every turn. Legacy JSON skills still load.

The default set covers:

- **Filesystem core** (always on) — read/write/edit, search, run commands, todo tracking, web fetch/search
- **Git** (always on) — status, diff, log, blame, commit drafting
- **Code review** — activates on "review my changes" / "review this PR"
- **Testing** — activates on "write tests", auto-detects vitest / jest / mocha / pytest / cargo test
- **Planning** — activates on "refactor", multi-step prompts
- **Semantic search** — activates on "how does", "where is", embedding lookups via local nomic-embed-text
- **Mail search** — activates when a Gmail MCP server is connected and the prompt references mail

Run `/skills` inside the REPL for the full list with descriptions and tool sets.
See [examples/skills/README.md](examples/skills/README.md) for the authoring guide
and copy-paste starters.

### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/lucide/notebook-pen.svg?color=%23a60ee5&width=22" align="absmiddle"> Project memory

Drop a `BANDIT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `AGENTS.md` at the workspace root — the
agent auto-loads it into the system prompt so it learns your conventions
once, not every turn. All three names work; `AGENTS.md` is the OpenAI Codex
/ GitHub Copilot convention and loads alongside the others if present.

The format that works best splits into two parts — **behavior** (how the agent
should act in this repo, inspired by Karpathy's CLAUDE.md) and **project facts**
(repo-specific things you'd otherwise re-explain every session):

```markdown
## Behavior

### Before editing
- Read the file first. Don't apply_edit blind.
- For changes larger than ~10 lines, prefer `replace_range` with line numbers
  over `apply_edit`'s exact-match string.

### When changing existing code
- Don't refactor adjacent code that wasn't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.

### When finishing a task
- Run the relevant verification (`test_run` / `run_command lint`).
- Don't claim done until verification passed.

## Project Facts
- This repo uses pnpm, not npm.
- Integration tests must hit a real database — no mocks.
- Prefer small focused PRs. Don't batch unrelated changes.
```

The repo root [`BANDIT.md`](BANDIT.md) is the reference implementation.

Use `/remember <fact>` inside the REPL to append a bullet from any session.
`/memory` shows everything loaded on the current turn. `/init` scaffolds a
fresh BANDIT.md in this two-section shape by reading the repo.

#### Topic memory (lazy-loaded)

For facts that only matter on some tasks — a migration playbook, an API
quirk, a deprecated module's history — drop a `MEMORY.md` index at the
repo root that points at files under `memory/`:

```markdown
# Project memory — topic index

- [Auth conventions](memory/auth.md) — when editing src/auth/*
- [Migration playbook](memory/migrations.md) — when adding DB migrations
- [CLI ink refactor](memory/cli-ink-refactor.md) — when changing the CLI input layer
```

The index (capped at 4 KB) loads into every system prompt; the linked files
do NOT. The agent reads the hook on each entry, and when one matches the
current task it calls `read_memory(name="<slug>")` to pull in the full
file (capped at 32 KB).

**When to put a fact in BANDIT.md vs `memory/<slug>.md`:**
- BANDIT.md — true on every turn (style rules, repo layout, default commands).
- `memory/<slug>.md` — only relevant to some tasks (deep history, area-specific
  playbooks, things that would bloat the system prompt for every other task).

This repo's own [`BANDIT.md`](BANDIT.md) is the reference implementation of
the always-loaded half.

### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/lucide/search.svg?color=%23a60ee5&width=22" align="absmiddle"> File mentions

Prefix a path with `@` in any prompt and the CLI inlines the file contents before the model sees it:

```
› why is @src/auth/login.ts throwing on line 42?
```

Up to 8 mentions per prompt, 64 KB each, auto-truncated.

### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/lucide/save.svg?color=%23a60ee5&width=22" align="absmiddle"> Session persistence

Every REPL session is saved as JSONL under `~/.bandit/sessions/`. Resume anytime:

```bash
bandit --resume 20260419-124501-ab3c
# or inside the REPL:
› /session list
› /session resume 20260419-124501-ab3c
```

### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/lucide/list-todo.svg?color=%23a60ee5&width=22" align="absmiddle"> In-agent todos

The agent can call `todo_write` to track multi-step work. Useful for longer tasks — the model sees its own plan and checks off steps as it finishes them.

### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/lucide/globe.svg?color=%23a60ee5&width=22" align="absmiddle"> Web fetch and search

`web_fetch <url>` pulls docs, RFCs, release notes directly into the conversation.
HTML is stripped to readable text, 16 KB cap, no auth. SSRF-guarded — refuses
to hit RFC1918, loopback, or cloud-metadata addresses unless
`BANDIT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_WEB_FETCH=1` is set.

`web_search <query>` returns ranked snippets via Tavily (free tier, set
`TAVILY_API_KEY`). The model gets titles, URLs, and short content blurbs — it can
follow up with `web_fetch` on a result when it needs the full page.

### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/lucide/zap.svg?color=%23a60ee5&width=22" align="absmiddle"> Slash commands (REPL)

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/help` | List slash commands |
| `/doctor` | Check setup, provider, model profile, and next actions |
| `/clear` | Reset conversation (keeps session id) |
| `/model <name>` | Switch model mid-session |
| `/skills` | List loaded skills |
| `/session list` / `resume <id>` / `new` | Manage sessions |
| `/memory` | Show auto-loaded `BANDIT.md` / `CLAUDE.md` |
| `/remember <fact>` | Append a bullet to `BANDIT.md` so the next session knows it |
| `/trace`, `/trace list`, `/trace failed` | Inspect recent turn telemetry and failed runs from workspace/global `.bandit/turns`; the IDE opens the Trace Logs viewer |
| `/insights` | Generate a local HTML report that synthesizes sessions + turn logs into cross-repo wins, tool stats, and friction |
| `/exit` | Quit |

### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/lucide/scissors.svg?color=%23a60ee5&width=22" align="absmiddle"> Unified-diff approval gate

Every file edit (`write_file`, `apply_edit`, `replace_range`, `apply_patch`) goes through the approval gate. The CLI and extension show a compact diff before touching disk:

```
╭── edit: src/auth/login.ts
│   function login(user, pass) {
│ - return checkPassword(user, pass);
│ + if (!user || !pass) throw new Error('missing creds');
│ + return await checkPassword(user, pass);
│   }
│    (+2 -1)
╰── apply? [y/N]
```

Each choice shows the exact rule it stores, so a grant never covers more than the prompt said:

```
│ 1 allow once   2 allow turn   3 allow session   4 always allow   5 deny
│ grants: any `git status …` command — until this session ends
╰── ↑↓←→ or 1–6 to choose · enter confirms · esc cancels
```

Approving `git status` grants `git status …`, not every shell command. `allow turn` covers a
batch of similar calls until the agent finishes the current turn, then expires.

#### Auto mode

`/auto on` in the CLI, `bandit --auto`, or `"permissions": { "mode": "auto" }` in
`.bandit/settings.json` lets routine work run without prompting — reading, editing files
inside the project, running builds and tests.

**Auto mode always asks before anything destructive**, and that floor cannot be configured
away — not by a settings file, and not by a saved allow rule that would otherwise cover the
call:

| Always asks | Examples |
|---|---|
| Deleting files | `delete_file`, `rm` |
| Writing outside the project | `../../etc/hosts`, `~/.zshrc` |
| Rewriting git history | `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd` |
| Machine-wide installs | `npm i -g`, `brew install`, `pipx install`, `npm publish` |
| Credential files | `.env`, `~/.ssh/*`, `~/.aws/credentials` |
| Sending data out | `curl -d`, `scp`, `rsync host:`, `nc` |
| Irreversible service calls | MCP `sendEmail`, `trashMessage`, `revokeAccess` |

`/permissions` shows the mode, your active grants, and everything auto mode ran without
asking. For unattended CI where nothing should prompt, set
`BANDIT_DANGEROUSLY_APPROVE_ALL=1` — it has no floor, which is why it is named that.

For large files, `read_file` paginates with line numbers and a `shown_hash`. The agent can call `replace_range` with `start_line`, `end_line`, replacement `content`, and optional `expected_hash` copied from `read_file` to land a method/component-sized refactor without resending the whole file or a giant exact-match string.

### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/lucide/webhook.svg?color=%23a60ee5&width=22" align="absmiddle"> Hooks

Drop `.bandit/settings.json` in any project:

```jsonc
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse":  [{ "match": "run_command", "command": "./scripts/guard.sh {{name}} {{primary}}" }],
    "PostToolUse": [{ "match": ".*", "command": "echo '{{name}} took {{duration}}ms' >> .bandit/audit.log" }],
    "Stop":        [{ "command": "osascript -e 'display notification \"bandit done\"'" }]
  }
}
```

- Hooks are shell commands. They run with `.bandit/` as the cwd.
- `{{name}}`, `{{primary}}`, `{{duration}}` are expanded at call time.
- A non-zero exit from a `PreToolUse` hook prints a warning (but doesn't yet abort — planned).

### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/lucide/chart-line.svg?color=%23a60ee5&width=22" align="absmiddle"> Insights — local-only activity report

`/insights` (CLI) or **Bandit Stealth: Open Insights** (IDE) generates a single self-contained HTML file from your local session and turn-log data — no server, no external resources, no telemetry, opens in any browser, sharable as one file. The report synthesizes how you and the agent have actually been working over time, broken into panels:

- **At a glance** — sessions, user prompts, token estimate, total tool calls, longest / current streak, peak day, days since first run, commits made
- **Your story** *(optional AI summary, gated by `insightsAiConsent`)* — three short narrative cards: *What you shipped* · *How you work* · *Where Bandit got in your way*. Cloud users see this when the cloud LLM consent is on; local Ollama users see it when a local model is configured. The framing prompt attributes every friction point to Bandit, never the user — the goal is empathetic product feedback, not a postmortem of the human
- **Recent wins** *(local synthesis, no AI)* — cross-repo arc detection from raw session text
- **How you felt** · **Bigger arcs** · **Largest work highlights** — extracted themes and longest investigations
- **Accomplishments** — files touched, edits + writes applied, git operations, subagents spawned, languages touched, most-touched files
- **Activity (last 14 days)** — inline SVG bar chart of prompt volume per day
- **Tool usage** — top N tools by call count with success/error split
- **Productivity tips** · **Recent sessions** · **Top error patterns**
- **Help shape Bandit** — one-click `mailto:` button that ships the HTML to `team@burtson.ai` only if you click it

Data sources are all local: `~/.bandit/sessions/*.jsonl` (every REPL session) + `<cwd>/.bandit/turns/*.jsonl` (per-turn telemetry for the current workspace). The report writes to `~/.bandit/insights.html` by default. The AI summary is the only path that touches a model — disable it with `insightsAiConsent: deny` in `~/.bandit/config.json` (or the equivalent setting in the IDE) for a fully offline report.

### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/lucide/wrench.svg?color=%23a60ee5&width=22" align="absmiddle"> Native tool calling (when the model supports it)

The runtime checks each model's built-in capability profile first (`bandit-logic`, the Qwen 3.6 family, Qwen 2.5 / 2.5-Coder, Llama 3.1+, Devstral, the bandit-core ≥12B fine-tunes) and routes tool schemas through Ollama's `tools:` field instead of the XML system-prompt block. Saves ~1.5–3 KB per turn and removes a whole class of "the model forgot the envelope" failures. Gemma 3 / Gemma 4 and other text-only families fall back to the XML protocol with the full mitigation stack armed. As of v1.7.340, the dispatch is gated on the built-in profile so an Ollama auto-detect glitch can't silently downgrade a tool-calling model — and the same retry ladder (3 native attempts → text channel switch → 3 text attempts → outer-text-retry → 3 more attempts → final-anchor re-prompt) protects every native-tools turn from transient gateway blips.

### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/lucide/plug.svg?color=%23a60ee5&width=22" align="absmiddle"> Model Context Protocol — both directions

Bandit speaks MCP as a **client** and a **server**. Drop any MCP server (filesystem, GitHub, Slack, GitLab, Gmail, Postgres, your own) into `~/.bandit/mcp-servers.json` or `<workspace>/.bandit/mcp-servers.json` and its tools surface as `<server>.<tool>` alongside the native ones. Stdio (`command`/`args`/`env`) and remote Streamable HTTP (`url` + `auth`, including `auth: "bandit"` for the hosted gateway) both supported as of v1.7.333. First spawn of any server requires user approval; "Always allow" persists a fingerprint to `~/.bandit/mcp-trust.json`. Connector wizards in the IDE Settings → Connections for GitHub/Slack/GitLab/Gmail/Custom; CLI parity via `/mcp add github <token>` etc.

`bandit mcp serve` turns the CLI into an MCP server exposing the native tool surface over stdio — any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, Continue) can drive Bandit's tools through the standard JSON-RPC envelope. `--read-only` strips write/exec tools for view-only clients.

### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/lucide/mic.svg?color=%23a60ee5&width=22" align="absmiddle"> Voice — pluggable providers, independent of chat

Speech-to-text and text-to-speech are configured separately from the chat provider. Run Ollama locally for chat and pair it with whichever voice setup matches your privacy / cost / latency preference. STT: Bandit cloud, OpenAI-compatible Whisper (faster-whisper-server, whisper.cpp HTTP, OpenAI, LiteLLM), or any custom multipart endpoint. TTS: Bandit cloud, OpenAI (`tts-1` / `tts-1-hd`), ElevenLabs, a local Piper HTTP server, or any custom URL. Local-only setups (Ollama + self-hosted Whisper + Piper) work without a cloud account.

### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/lucide/workflow.svg?color=%23a60ee5&width=22" align="absmiddle"> Mid-turn queue + background subagents

Type a follow-up while the agent is still working and it queues (`queued: N · sends after this turn` in the status row); Esc cancels the run and clears the queue. The agent can spawn background subagents for long investigations and keep iterating in the foreground — when a subagent finishes, its synopsis injects into the parent's next iteration instead of forcing a `check_task` poll loop (v1.7.336+). Inspect with `/tasks`, cancel with `/tasks cancel <id>`. Stop cascades to all in-flight subagents (v1.7.338).

### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/lucide/palette.svg?color=%23a60ee5&width=22" align="absmiddle"> UI/UX polish

- ANSI color, box-drawn headers, "shifty eyes" spinner with a breathing glow on truecolor terminals
- Clean `→ tool-name arg` tool-call lines with `✦ using skill: …` markers
- Live plan dock — `todo_write` updates commit to scrollback as the plan evolves
- Per-turn timer + live tok/s on the status line, terminal title reflects the active prompt
- Colored unified diff viewer in the approval gate
- Respects `NO_COLOR` / `BANDIT_NO_COLOR` / non-TTY stdout

---

## Model support

Built-in capability profiles ship for the families listed below. Anything else gets auto-introspected through Ollama's `/api/show` and matched to a behavior profile by name pattern. The canonical inventory lives in [`packages/stealth-core-runtime/src/runtime/modelCapabilities.ts`](packages/stealth-core-runtime/src/runtime/modelCapabilities.ts).

**Recommended starting points** — the proven set, aligned with the models the Ollama ecosystem promotes for agent work:

| Your hardware | Pick |
|---|---|
| Any machine, no GPU | `kimi-k2.6:cloud` or `kimi-k2.7-code:cloud` (Ollama Cloud — see [below](#ollama-cloud)) |
| 24–48 GB GPU / unified memory | `qwen3.6:27b` (best local agent pick) |
| 16–32 GB | `gemma4:26b` |
| Laptop / smaller | `gemma4:12b` or `gemma4:e4b` |
| Apple silicon | `qwen3.6:27b-mlx`, `gemma4:26b-mlx` (MLX builds resolve to the same profiles) |

| Model | Size | Native tool calling | Vision | Context | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bandit-logic` (Qwen 3.6 27B, hosted) | — | ✓ | ✓ | 256K | Cloud default — agent-tuned, no local install, thinking mode |
| `qwen3.6:27b` | ~17 GB | ✓ | ✓ | 256K | Best local pick — same family as `bandit-logic`, M-series 48GB+ or H100-class |
| `qwen3.6:35b` | ~24 GB | ✓ | ✓ | 256K | Larger Qwen 3.6; tends to stall in reasoning-only output, prefer 27B for agent loops |
| `kimi-k2*` (Ollama Cloud) | — | ✓ | varies | 256K | Frontier agentic-coding family (1T MoE / 32B active). `kimi-k2` / `kimi-k2-thinking` are text-only; `kimi-k2.5` / `:2.6` / `:2.7-code` are multimodal. Runs on Ollama Cloud, no local GPU — see [Ollama Cloud](#ollama-cloud) |
| `gemma4:31b` | ~19 GB | text-fallback | ✓ | 128K | RTX 5090 / GPU node — high-fidelity local |
| `gemma4:26b` | ~17 GB | text-fallback | ✓ | 128K | Mac 32GB+ alternative when Qwen 3.6 is too heavy |
| `gemma4:e4b` | ~3 GB | text-fallback | ✓ | 16K | Lightweight laptop pick — punches above its weight on tool sequencing |
| `gemma4:e2b` | ~2 GB | text-fallback | ✓ | 16K | Smallest "effective" Gemma 4 tune |
| `gemma3:12b` / `gemma3:27b` | ~9 / 17 GB | text-fallback | ✓ | 32K | Older Gemma 3 family — still works, gets less attention |
| `qwen2.5-coder:14b` / `:32b` / `:72b` | ~9 / 20 / 45 GB | ✓ | — | 128K | Code-completion tune — good on concrete tasks, weaker as autonomous agent |
| `qwen2.5:7b` / `:32b` / `:72b` | varies | ✓ | — | 128K | Qwen 2.5 base — text only, reliable tool emitter |
| `qwen2.5vl` / `qwen2-vl` | varies | ✓ | ✓ | 32–128K | Qwen vision-language variants |
| `llama3.1` | varies | ✓ | — | 128K | Meta's Llama 3.1 — text only |
| `llama3.2-vision` | varies | text-fallback | ✓ | 128K | Llama 3.2 multimodal |
| `llama3` | varies | text-fallback | — | 8K | Original Llama 3 — narrow context, kept for compatibility |
| `bandit-core:12b` / `:27b` / `:31b` | varies | ✓ | optional | 32K–128K | Our own Gemma-3-derived fine-tunes (12B / 27B / 31B) |
| `bandit-core-1` / `bandit-core-2` (hosted) | — | varies | varies | 128K | Hosted bandit fine-tunes — `-1` for lightweight, `-2` for RunPod 70B (text-only) |
| `deepseek-coder:6.7b` | ~4 GB | text-fallback | — | 16K | Small, fast code model |
| `llava` | varies | text-fallback | ✓ | 4K | Dedicated vision model (optional pull) |
| any other Ollama model | — | auto-detected via `/api/show` | auto-detected | auto-detected | Drop-in via `BANDIT_MODEL` |

**Primary development and test targets** are `bandit-logic` (cloud) and the **gemma4 / qwen3.6** local families. **Models we don't recommend for autonomous agent work** — `gpt-oss:120b` (post-trained for OpenAI's harmony tool-call format, narrates without emitting tool calls), and code-completion tunes like `qwen2.5-coder:32b` on ambiguous prompts (asks for paths instead of probing). See [`apps/bandit-stealth/README.md`](apps/bandit-stealth/README.md#models-we-dont-recommend-for-agent-work) for the full caveats.

Model behavior profiles now sit beside capability detection. `/profile` explains the active model's harness strategy — native vs text tools, fallback policy, safe context/output budget, thinking default, max tool parallelism, and reliability guardrails. Both the CLI and extension load `.bandit/model-profiles.json`, and the tool loop now uses those profile values to choose native-vs-text tools, serialize risky edit batches, cap parallel calls, and decide whether native failures should fall back to text tools.

### Ollama Cloud

Want a frontier model without the GPU? [Ollama Cloud](https://docs.ollama.com/cloud) runs large
models — like **Kimi K2** (1T MoE, 256K context, built for agentic coding) and `gpt-oss:120b` —
on Ollama's hosted infrastructure, accessed through the same API Bandit already speaks. Your
prompts run in the cloud; your repo still stays on your machine except for the context the model
needs (same as any hosted model).

**Easiest path — local daemon (recommended):**

```bash
# 1. Sign in to Ollama once (opens a browser)
ollama signin

# 2. Pull a cloud model — the cloud tag offloads to Ollama Cloud
ollama pull kimi-k2.7-code:cloud      # multimodal coding agent
#   or:  ollama pull kimi-k2:1t-cloud  # text-only base K2

# 3. Use it in Bandit like any local model
bandit --model kimi-k2.7-code:cloud
#   or inside the REPL:  /model kimi-k2.7-code:cloud
```

That's it — Bandit talks to your local Ollama daemon (`localhost:11434`), which transparently
offloads cloud-tagged models. Bandit ships tuned profiles for the whole Kimi family (native tool
calling, 256K context, vision on the multimodal `k2.5` / `k2.6` / `k2.7-code` variants), and both
cloud tag shapes — `:1t-cloud` and `:cloud` — resolve automatically.

**Direct cloud API (no local daemon):** point Bandit straight at `ollama.com` with an
[API key](https://ollama.com/settings/keys):

```jsonc
// ~/.bandit/config.json
{
  "provider": "ollama",
  "model": "kimi-k2:1t",
  "ollama": {
    "url": "https://ollama.com",
    "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <your-ollama-api-key>" }
  }
}
```

In the **VS Code / Cursor extension**, set the Ollama base URL to `https://ollama.com` and paste
your key into the **Ollama auth token** field (stored in the OS secret store, sent as
`Authorization: Bearer`).

> If a cloud model returns **401/403**, you're not signed in or the key is missing/expired —
> Bandit surfaces a hint pointing you at `ollama signin`. The model itself is fine.

---

## Benchmarks

Two reproducible runs, same harness — a hosted model on a medium repo, and a frontier open model self-evaluating this monorepo. Not a leaderboard; just honest traces you can re-run.

### A hosted model on a medium repo

`bandit-logic` (Qwen 3.6 27B via the hosted gateway) given a fresh **"deep dive this repo and tell me what it does at a high level"** prompt against a real React + TypeScript + Vite project (the author's personal portfolio site — 11 projects, ~30 files, no inlined `@`-mentions).

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Wall-clock turn duration** | 28.25 s |
| **LLM iterations** | 5 (4 tool-call rounds + 1 final answer) |
| **Tool calls** | 12 (`read_file` ×10, `ls` ×1, `list_files` ×1) |
| **Final answer length** | 2,022 chars (~500 tokens) |
| **Per-iteration LLM time** | 5.05 s → 2.95 s → 2.56 s → 4.85 s → 12.81 s (final answer) |
| **Provider** | `bandit` cloud (`provider=bandit`, `model=bandit-logic`) |
| **CLI version** | 1.7.348 |
| **Trace** | `Portfolio/.bandit/turns/turn-2026-05-30T21-26-52-368Z-afyl.jsonl` |

The shape of the run is what we want out of the harness: the model probes (`ls` + `package.json`), narrows (`README` + `src/**` listing), reads the entry points (`App.tsx`, `main.tsx`, `index.html`), pulls in the data files (`projects.ts`, `experience.ts`, `skills.ts`) and two representative section components, then commits to a final answer instead of padding with one more probe round. No reasoning-only stalls, no retry slots fired, no native-fallback re-prompts.

**Hardware:** the cloud provider serves `bandit-logic` from our own GPU pool; the client side ran on an M4 Max MacBook Pro. For local model comparisons, our reference rigs are an M4 Max (`qwen3.6:27b` ~ 17 GB resident, ~ 30 tok/s) and an RTX 5090 node (`gemma4:31b` ~ 19 GB resident, ~ 80 tok/s). Numbers will vary on different hardware; the run above is one data point, not a leaderboard.

**Reproduce it yourself:**

```bash
cd /path/to/any/medium-sized/repo
BANDIT_PROVIDER=bandit BANDIT_MODEL=bandit-logic \
  bandit "deep dive this repo and tell me what it does at a high level"
# Then read .bandit/turns/turn-*.jsonl for the full event timeline.
```

### A frontier open model on the framework's own monorepo

A second run, same harness, harder target — a self-eval. **Kimi K2** (`kimi-k2.7-code:cloud` — a 1-trillion-parameter MoE, ~32B active, served through [Ollama Cloud](https://ollama.com)) given a deliberately two-part prompt against **this repository**, the Bandit monorepo itself (622 TypeScript files across 6 packages and 4 apps — an order of magnitude larger than the portfolio above):

> deep dive this repo and tell me what it does at a high level — and what could be holding this repo back from being even better

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Wall-clock turn duration** | 64.2 s |
| **LLM iterations** | 14 (13 tool-call rounds + a forced final synthesis) |
| **Tool calls** | 60, batched across the 13 tool rounds (~4.6/round) — `read_file` ×44, `ls` ×8, `search_code` ×5, `list_files` ×2, `run_command` ×1 (`git log --oneline -20`) |
| **Final answer length** | 6,800 chars (~1,700 tokens) — both halves of the prompt answered |
| **Per-iteration LLM time** | 2.1 s median, 20.6 s on the closing synthesis round |
| **Provider** | `ollama`, the local daemon proxying to Ollama Cloud (`model=kimi-k2.7-code:cloud`) |
| **Bandit version** | 1.7.373 (VS Code extension) |
| **Trace** | `.bandit/turns/turn-2026-06-18T04-30-23-330Z-qo2s.jsonl` |

What stands out is the **tool batching**: rather than one read per round, Kimi fires four-to-six file reads or searches in parallel each iteration — one round reads six files at once, another runs five `search_code` queries in a single pass. The trajectory is what you'd want from a senior engineer dropped into an unfamiliar repo: probe (`ls`), broaden, read the entry points deeply, run targeted `search_code` for the cross-cutting concerns, check `git log` for recent direction, then synthesize. The write-up correctly named the layered package architecture *and* answered the critique half — flagging a real structural smell on its own: the `agent-adapters/{provider,node,vscode,web,github}` packages as near-identical empty shells, paying monorepo overhead for little host-specific code.

One caveat, reported honestly: this run hit the configured iteration ceiling (`hitLimit: true`) and was forced to commit to its answer after 13 rounds of exploration rather than stopping on its own. On a repo this size with a two-part prompt, that's the signal to raise `BANDIT_MAX_ITERATIONS` (or the extension's iteration setting) for monorepo-scale deep dives — the answer was complete, but Kimi clearly had more it wanted to read.

**Reproduce it** (Kimi cloud requires a paid Ollama plan — swap in a free local model like `qwen3.6:27b` to exercise the same loop):

```bash
ollama signin                      # one-time: links your Ollama Cloud account
ollama pull kimi-k2.7-code:cloud
BANDIT_PROVIDER=ollama BANDIT_MODEL=kimi-k2.7-code:cloud BANDIT_MAX_ITERATIONS=30 \
  bandit "deep dive this repo and tell me what it does at a high level — and what could be holding it back"
```

## Architecture

```
User prompt
  ↓
SkillRegistry.resolveActiveSkills(prompt)
  ↓
ToolUseLoop (observe → act → replan)
  ↓
  ├─ ToolRegistry (XML tool defs in system prompt)
  │     ├─ Built-in tools (read, write, search, run, git, …)
  │     ├─ CLI tools (todo_write, remember, web_fetch, web_search)
  │     └─ Custom skills from .bandit/skills/*.md (or legacy *.json)
  │
  ├─ LLM Provider
  │     ├─ Ollama (/api/chat, streaming NDJSON)
  │     └─ Bandit Cloud (optional hosted inference)
  │
  ├─ LanguageAdapters (pre-write validation)
  │     └─ TypeScript, Python, JSON, C# (more via skills)
  │
  └─ Host-specific bindings
        ├─ bandit-stealth (VS Code / Cursor) — vscode API, webview UI
        └─ bandit-cli (terminal) — readline REPL, ANSI, sessions
```

**Design rules:**

1. Local models are first-class citizens, not a fallback.
2. One runtime, multiple hosts. Skills / memory / hooks are host-agnostic.
3. Language adapters validate before write. Invalid content never reaches disk.
4. Skills activate based on intent. The model decides when to plan vs. act directly.

## What is still maturing

To keep expectations honest — areas still on the roadmap:

- Plan mode (in the CLI — the VS Code extension has a variant)
- Status-line / full TUI polish
- Lossless trace replay for every native-tool run

See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for what's planned.

---

## Custom skills

Ask the agent to build one: *"create a skill that runs my linter"* — it writes `.bandit/skills/linter.md` (markdown with YAML frontmatter is the current shape; legacy `*.json` still loads) and next prompt it's live.

Or author by hand. The manifest format is documented in [`examples/skills/README.md`](examples/skills/README.md).

## Bandit Cloud

For teams that want hosted infrastructure — workspace indexing, Qdrant semantic search, team dashboards, GPU inference, PR automation — see [Bandit Cloud](https://burtson.ai).

## Contributing tests

The agent runtime (`@burtson-labs/agent-core`) is the most heavily tested package. New behaviors should land with a contract test, and recurring failure modes worth defending against should land with a real-trace replay fixture.

- **Run everything:** `pnpm test` (what CI runs on your PR). One package: `pnpm --filter @burtson-labs/agent-core test`
- **What's pinned:** see [packages/agent-core/README.md](packages/agent-core/README.md) for the full coverage map (constructor options, every detector cluster, cancellation, compaction, replay).
- **Adding a regression fixture from a real failure trace:** [packages/agent-core/test/fixtures/turns/README.md](packages/agent-core/test/fixtures/turns/README.md) walks through the steps — picking a `.bandit/turns/*.jsonl`, replay-completeness limits, naming, and what to assert.
