NTM turns `tmux` into a local control plane for multi-agent software development.
It combines session orchestration, graph-aware work triage, safety policy and approvals,
Agent Mail coordination, durable state capture, machine-readable robot surfaces, and a
local REST/WebSocket API in one Go binary.

## TL;DR

### The Problem

Running several coding agents in parallel is easy to start and annoying to sustain.
Plain `tmux` gives you panes, but it does not give you durable coordination, work
selection, safety policy, approvals, history, replayable automation surfaces, or a
shared control model that both humans and agents can use.

### The Solution

NTM gives you a single local system for:

- spawning labeled multi-agent sessions in `tmux`
- sending work, interrupts, and follow-ups across panes
- triaging what to do next with `br` and `bv`
- coordinating agents with Agent Mail, file reservations, and assignments
- protecting dangerous operations with policy, approvals, and guards
- exposing the whole system through `--robot-*`, REST, SSE, WebSocket, and OpenAPI
- capturing state with checkpoints, timelines, audit trails, and pipeline state

### Why NTM

| Area | What NTM provides | Typical commands |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Session orchestration | Spawn, label, inspect, zoom, dashboard, palette | `ntm spawn`, `ntm dashboard`, `ntm palette` |
| Work intelligence | Graph-aware triage, next-step selection, impact analysis, assignment | `ntm work triage`, `ntm work next`, `ntm assign` |
| Coordination | Human overseer mail, inbox views, file reservations, worktrees | `ntm mail`, `ntm locks`, `ntm worktrees` |
| Safety | Destructive-command protection, policy editing, approval workflows | `ntm safety`, `ntm policy`, `ntm approve`, `ntm guards` |
| Durable operations | Checkpoints, timelines, audit logs, saved sessions, pipelines | `ntm checkpoint`, `ntm timeline`, `ntm audit`, `ntm pipeline` |
| Automation surfaces | Robot JSON, REST API, SSE/WebSocket streams, OpenAPI | `ntm --robot-snapshot`, `ntm serve`, `ntm openapi generate` |

## Quick Start

### Requirements

NTM is a pure Go project, but the runtime experience is intentionally integration-heavy.

- Required: `tmux`
- Required for agent spawning: whichever CLIs you want to run, typically Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity CLI, or Grok Build (Gemini CLI is supported as legacy)
- Optional but powerful: `br`, `bv`, Agent Mail, `cass`, `dcg`, `pt`
- Sanity check everything with `ntm deps -v`

### First Session

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/main/install.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --easy-mode

# Enable shell integration
eval "$(ntm shell zsh)"

# Verify tools and integrations
ntm deps -v

# Scaffold a project directory
ntm quick api --template=go

# Launch a mixed swarm
ntm spawn api --cc=2 --cod=1 --agy=1

# Open the live operator surfaces
ntm dashboard api
ntm palette api

# Dispatch work
ntm send api --cc "Map the auth layer and propose a refactor plan."

# If the repo uses br/bv, inspect the work graph
ntm work triage --format=markdown

# Save a recoverable checkpoint
ntm checkpoint save api -m "before auth refactor"

# Expose local APIs for dashboards, scripts, and agents
ntm serve --port 7337
ntm --robot-snapshot
```

## Core Workflows

### 1. Multi-Agent Session Orchestration

NTM is built around named `tmux` sessions with explicit agent panes and a user pane.
It handles session naming, pane layout, agent startup, labels, and inspection so you
can treat a swarm like a manageable unit instead of a pile of terminals.

```bash
ntm quick payments --template=go
ntm spawn payments --cc=3 --cod=2 --agy=1
ntm add payments --cc=1
ntm list
ntm status payments
ntm view payments
ntm zoom payments 3
ntm attach payments
```

#### Grok Build (phase one)

NTM recognizes the official xAI Grok Build CLI as the canonical `grok` agent
type. Install it using [xAI's current instructions](https://docs.x.ai/build/overview),
then authenticate without putting credentials in NTM configuration:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash
grok login                   # browser authentication
grok login --device-auth     # SSH/headless alternative
ntm deps -v
```

A bare spec delegates model selection to Grok Build. Use `grok models` to inspect
the models available to the authenticated account, then pass an exact model ID
only when an override is needed:

```bash
ntm spawn research --grok=1
ntm spawn research --grok=1:MODEL_ID
ntm spawn research --grok=1:MODEL_ID:EFFORT
ntm --robot-spawn=research --spawn-grok=1
```

NTM launches Grok Build with its official `--always-approve` automation flag.
Phase one intentionally covers configuration, model and `--effort` arguments,
launch, adopt, exact process discovery, status/count/schema/doctor projections,
and topology-only saved-session restore. Authenticated fullscreen-TUI readiness,
automated prompt delivery/assignment, interrupt-with-message, restart, and
restore-time process relaunch are not yet claimed. Those operations fail closed
before pane mutation; interact with an authenticated Grok pane directly. Robot
`--spawn-wait` and `--spawn-assign-work` also fail closed for Grok panes.

Use labels when you want multiple coordinated swarms on the same project while
keeping a shared project directory:

```bash
ntm quick payments --template=go
ntm spawn payments --label backend --cc=2 --cod=1
ntm spawn payments --label frontend --cc=2
ntm add payments --label frontend --cc=1
```

#### Worktree isolation and reservations

Use `--worktrees` when agents need independent Git checkouts as well as separate
tmux panes. NTM creates one `ntm/<session>/<agent>` branch and worktree per
agent, so filesystem changes and destructive Git operations stay isolated until
you deliberately merge them:

```bash
ntm spawn payments --cc=3 --worktrees
ntm worktrees list
ntm worktrees merge cc_1
ntm worktrees clean --session payments
```

Worktrees do not replace Agent Mail reservations. Continue to reserve the files
or areas an agent owns: reservations communicate intent, reduce merge conflicts,
and give operators an auditable ownership record; worktrees provide the separate
checkout boundary. Merge reviewed agent branches into `main`, then clean the
session's worktrees when that session is finished.

### 2. Dispatch, Monitoring, and Recovery

Humans can broadcast prompts, interrupt panes, stream output, inspect health, compare
responses, search pane history, and keep an eye on activity without dropping to raw
`tmux` commands.

```bash
ntm send payments --all "Checkpoint and summarize current progress."
ntm interrupt payments
ntm activity payments --watch
ntm health payments
ntm watch payments --cc
ntm extract payments --lang=go
ntm diff payments cc_1 cod_1
ntm grep "timeout" payments -C 3
ntm analytics --days 7
```

### 3. Work Graph Triage and Assignment

NTM integrates with `br` and `bv` so the operator loop is not just "send prompts and
hope." It can surface the best next task, highlight blockers, analyze impact, forecast
work, and push assignments to specific panes or agent types.

```bash
ntm work triage
ntm work triage --by-track
ntm work alerts
ntm work search "JWT auth"
ntm work impact internal/api/auth.go
ntm work next
ntm work graph
ntm assign payments --auto --strategy=dependency
ntm assign payments --beads=br-123,br-124 --agent=codex
```

Automated assignment treats tracker labels as an authorization boundary. Add
organization-specific approval labels globally or in `.ntm/config.toml`; project
labels extend the global list and cannot remove built-in gates:

```toml
[assign]
operator_gated_labels = ["security-review", "legal-approval"]
```

Matching is case-insensitive. NTM requires a structurally valid full actionable
plan, uses scored triage only to rank IDs authorized by that plan, and restores
every candidate's labels from both `br ready` and `br list --status open` so
epics are covered. Any plan command, parse, structure, ID, label lookup, or
coverage failure stops automated assignment before dispatch.

When `br` and `bv` report that no ready work exists, use the queue-dry flow to
distinguish a genuinely empty queue from stale coordination state:

```bash
# Confirm the work queue first. Do not run bare bv; use robot output.
br ready --json
bv --robot-triage | jq '.triage.quick_ref'

# Diagnose why the queue appears dry.
ntm work queue-dry --format=json | jq '{queue_dry, evidence, recommendations}'

# Render an advisory roadmap only after the dry queue is confirmed.
ntm work queue-dry --ideate --format=json | jq '{
  queue_dry,
  ideation: {
    status: .ideation.status,
    guard: .ideation.guard.recommendation,
    rendered: .ideation.roadmap.rendered_count,
    preview: .ideation.creation.remaining_commands
  },
  warnings
}'

# The same plan is available as markdown for human review.
ntm work queue-dry --ideate --format=markdown
```

Review the duplicate and novelty evidence before creating anything. If `br ready`
has work, or `bv --robot-triage` shows actionable recommendations, claim that work
instead of ideating. `--force` is only for an explicit preview when an operator wants
to inspect the plan despite ready work or degraded tracker state.

Gated creation is opt-in and still uses Beads as the source of truth:

```bash
# Re-check the preview and guard before mutating Beads.
ntm work queue-dry --ideate --format=json | jq '.ideation.creation.remaining_commands'

# Create proposed beads only after review. The plan version is an audit token.
ntm work queue-dry --ideate --create-beads --yes --plan-version="$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"

# Validate the graph and export Beads state after any mutation.
br dep cycles --json
bv --robot-triage | jq '.triage.quick_ref'
br sync --flush-only
git add .beads/issues.jsonl
```

If Agent Mail, CASS, or CM are unavailable, `queue-dry --ideate` keeps running and
marks those sources as degraded in `warnings`. Treat degraded Agent Mail reservation
visibility as a coordination stop sign for mutating creation; fix coordination or use
the non-mutating preview. Never edit `.beads/*.jsonl` directly, and use
`ntm work queue-dry --help` for the current flag surface.

### 4. Coordination, Reservations, and Human Oversight

NTM exposes Agent Mail and reservation workflows directly from the CLI. You can act as
Human Overseer, inspect inbox state, review reservations, renew or force-release stale
locks, and coordinate work without inventing an ad hoc protocol.

```bash
ntm mail send payments --all "Sync to main and report blockers."
ntm mail inbox payments
ntm locks list payments --all-agents
ntm locks renew payments
ntm locks force-release payments 42 --note "agent inactive"
ntm coordinator status payments
ntm coordinator digest payments
ntm coordinator conflicts payments
ntm coordinator enable auto-assign
ntm coordinator enable digest --interval=30m
ntm coordinator disable conflict-negotiate
```

`ntm locks force-release` is approval-gated by default (`automation.force_release:
approval`): the first invocation files a durable approval request, a second operator
grants it with `ntm approve <id>` (self-approval is rejected), and re-running the
command consumes that approval and executes exactly once. Use
`ntm policy automation --force-release auto` to allow unattended force-release, or
`never` to disable it entirely; the serve HTTP endpoint and the dashboard conflict
action honor the same policy setting.

#### Pane identity badges

In a mixed session, pane titles name the harness (`payments__cc_1`) while
coordination happens under Agent Mail names (`BlueLake`). NTM can show each managed
pane's assigned name in its tmux pane border next to the existing title:

```toml
[agent_mail]
enabled = true
pane_badges = true                        # default false (opt-in)
# pane_badge_format = "[{name}{drift}]{lifecycle}"
```

The badge is NTM's assigned identity (the session agent registry, keyed by stable
pane id), never whatever a later process wrote to the pane identity file. At every
reconciliation NTM compares the assignment with the canonical Agent Mail identity
file (legacy plain-text name or the structured record Agent Mail >= 0.3.31 writes)
and caches the outcome in per-pane tmux user options
(`@ntm_agent_mail_name`, `@ntm_agent_mail_state`, `@ntm_agent_mail_lifecycle`,
`@ntm_agent_mail_label`); the window's `pane-border-format` gains a fragment that
renders only the cached label, so tmux never calls Agent Mail while drawing.

| Border | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[BlueLake]` | current assignment; names agree (binding verified, or a legacy file that cannot be verified) |
| `[BlueLake!]` | current assignment; the identity file disagrees (`name-disagreement`), is `missing-file` / `unreadable-file` / `invalid-file`, or its binding is `binding-unverifiable` / `binding-stale` — the assigned name is retained |
| `[?!]` | no current assignment: `assignment-stale` (pane generation changed), `assignment-unobservable` (tmux unreadable) or `assignment-unregistered` |
| `… (starting)`, `… (exited)`, `… (unknown)` | lifecycle observed at the last reconciliation; running agents carry no marker |

Badges are written alongside identity assignment before the agent launches
(`(starting)`) and reconciled on `ntm spawn`, `ntm add`, `ntm adopt`, restart/respawn
and on explicit refresh with `ntm mapping --session <session>`, which also prints the
discrepancy report (assigned vs resolved name, source path, assignment/observation
state, `last_attempt_at` / `last_success_at`) and carries the same data under
`identity` and `discrepancies` in `--json`. They describe the last reconciliation, not
continuous liveness. Badge failures warn and never block a launch or change an
assignment.

Set `pane_badges = false` and run `ntm mapping --session <session>` to withdraw the
pane options and restore the window's previous `pane-border-format` (including
inheritance). Opt a single session out with
`tmux set-option -t =<session>: @ntm_agent_mail_badges off`. A `pane-border-format`
you wrote yourself that references `@ntm_agent_mail_*` is left untouched, and windows
linked into several sessions are skipped with a diagnostic.

`coordinator enable` and `disable` persist the selected `--config` file, or the
global config by default, without replacing unrelated settings or comments.
Restart an already running `ntm coordinator run` daemon to apply a toggle.
The selected file may use a `[coordinator]` table or root dotted assignments
such as `coordinator.auto_assign = false`. A whole-section inline assignment
such as `coordinator = { auto_assign = false }` is rejected without changing
the file; convert it to either supported form before toggling a feature.

### 5. Safety Policy and Approvals

NTM includes a first-class safety system for destructive or sensitive actions. Policy
rules define what is allowed, blocked, or approval-gated. Approvals are durable, auditable,
and support SLB-style two-person workflows for high-risk operations.

```bash
ntm safety status
ntm safety check -- git reset --hard
ntm safety blocked --hours 24
ntm safety install

ntm policy show --all
ntm policy validate
ntm policy edit
ntm policy automation

ntm approve list
ntm approve show abc123
ntm approve abc123
ntm approve deny abc123 --reason "wrong target branch"
```

### 6. Pipelines, Templates, Recipes, and Workflow Assets

NTM supports several layers of reusable automation:

- `recipes`: reusable session presets
- `workflows`: runnable orchestration patterns such as pipeline, ping-pong, and review-gate — `ntm workflow run <name>` executes a template's coordination loop against a live session (`ntm spawn -t <name>` only uses a template's agent counts to size a session)
- `template`: prompt templates and substitutions
- `pipeline`: executable multi-step agent workflows with variables, dependencies, resume, and cleanup
- `session-templates`: higher-level session layouts

```bash
ntm recipes list
ntm recipes show full-stack
ntm workflows list
ntm workflows show red-green
ntm workflow run red-green --var feature="parser rewrite"
ntm workflow run ./my-flow.toml --session payments
ntm template list
ntm template show fix-bug

ntm pipeline run .ntm/pipelines/review.yaml --session payments
ntm pipeline status run-20241230-123456-abcd
ntm pipeline list
ntm pipeline resume run-20241230-123456-abcd --mode=continue
ntm pipeline cleanup --older=7d
```

Pipeline resume preserves completed step outputs by default and re-runs the first incomplete
step or loop iteration. Commands, templates, and foreach/loop iteration bodies should be
idempotent when resumed, or operators should resume with `--keep-state=false` or
`--mode=force-iter --step-id=<id> --iteration=<n>` to deliberately re-run work.

### 7. Durable State, Audit, and Recovery

NTM treats recoverability as a core feature. Sessions can be checkpointed, timelines can
be replayed, audit records can be exported, and prompt/session history remains available
for analysis or resumption.

```bash
ntm checkpoint save payments -m "pre-migration"
ntm checkpoint list payments
ntm checkpoint restore payments

ntm timeline list
ntm timeline show <session-id>
ntm history search "authentication error"
ntm audit show payments
ntm conflicts payments
ntm resume payments
```

## Robot Mode and Local API

NTM has two automation layers:

- `--robot-*` for local, machine-readable CLI interactions
- `ntm serve` for REST, SSE, WebSocket, and OpenAPI-backed integrations

### Canonical Robot Surfaces

Start with these:

```bash
ntm --robot-help
ntm --robot-capabilities
ntm --robot-status
ntm --robot-snapshot
ntm --robot-plan
ntm --robot-dashboard
ntm --robot-markdown --md-compact
ntm --robot-terse
```

Common task-specific surfaces:

```bash
ntm --robot-send=payments --msg="Summarize current blockers." --type=claude
ntm --robot-ack=payments --ack-timeout=30s
ntm --robot-tail=payments --lines=50
ntm --robot-mail-check --mail-project=payments --urgent-only
ntm --robot-cass-search="authentication error"
```

### REST, SSE, WebSocket, and OpenAPI

Run the local server:

```bash
ntm serve
```

Important surfaces:

- REST API under `/api/v1`
- server-sent events at `/events`
- WebSocket subscriptions at `/ws`
- health check at `/health`
- generated OpenAPI spec at [`docs/openapi.json`](docs/openapi.json)

Generate or refresh the OpenAPI document:

```bash
ntm openapi generate
ntm openapi generate --stdout
```

## Command Map

| Command group | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `quick`, `init`, `spawn`, `add`, `attach`, `view`, `zoom`, `dashboard`, `palette`, `kill` | Project bootstrap and session lifecycle |
| `send`, `interrupt`, `watch`, `activity`, `health`, `extract`, `diff`, `grep`, `analytics` | Day-to-day operator loop |
| `work`, `assign`, `coordinator` | Graph-aware prioritization, assignment, and conflict management |
| `mail`, `locks`, `worktrees` | Agent Mail coordination and file reservations |
| `safety`, `policy`, `approve`, `guards` | Safe-by-default operations and approval workflows |
| `checkpoint`, `timeline`, `history`, `audit`, `changes`, `resume` | Durable state and forensic surfaces |
| `recipes`, `workflows`, `template`, `session-templates`, `pipeline`, `ensemble` | Reusable orchestration assets |
| `serve`, `openapi`, `config`, `deps`, `upgrade`, `tutorial` | Integration, configuration, and operations |

`ntm --help` remains the canonical full command reference.

## Configuration and Project Assets

NTM supports user-level and project-level assets.

### User-Level

- main config: `~/.config/ntm/config.toml`
- recipes: `~/.config/ntm/recipes.toml`
- workflows: `~/.config/ntm/workflows/`
- personas/profiles: `~/.config/ntm/personas.toml`
- policy: `~/.ntm/policy.yaml`

### Project-Level

Project-local assets live under `.ntm/` and override built-ins and user defaults where appropriate.

- `.ntm/workflows/`
- `.ntm/pipelines/`
- `.ntm/personas.toml`
- `.ntm/recipes.toml`
- `.ntm/checkpoints/`
- `.ntm/config.toml` for project-scoped settings such as additional assignment approval labels

Useful config commands:

```bash
ntm config init
ntm config show
ntm config diff
ntm config get projects_base
ntm config edit
ntm config reset
```

Configuration loading is strict: unknown fields are errors. The unused TOML
`[health]` section has been removed; migrate restart and monitoring settings to
`[resilience]` (`auto_restart`, `max_restarts`, `restart_delay_seconds`,
`health_check_seconds`, and `crash_threshold`). The `ntm health` command remains
available and is unrelated to that removed config section.

### CAAM Seat Selection (opt-in, default off)

If you run several interchangeable subscription seats through
[CAAM](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/caam) — three Codex Pro logins, say
— NTM can choose which one a new pane launches on instead of leaving that to
whatever your agent command template pins:

```toml
[integrations.caam]
seat_selection = true
```

With the key on, a `spawn`/`add` pane that carries **no** persona asks
`caam limits <provider> --rank earliest-reset-headroom` and launches under the
matching `codex-<profile>` / `claude-<profile>` persona. The rank spends the
included allowance that refreshes **soonest while it still has headroom** and
preserves the later-resetting reserve seat. (It is deliberately not
`caam precheck --best`, which ranks lowest utilization and would pick the idle
reserve — the opposite of the policy.)

The semantics, exactly:

- **A pin always wins.** `--persona=codex-acme`, `--profile-set`, and recipe
  personas are never re-ranked and never overridden. Only a pane with no
  persona at all is placed.
- **One query per provider per command.** `ntm add --cod=4` shells out to caam
  once, not four times; the ranked seat is a property of the pool.
- **Later `ntm add`s re-rank.** A pane added to a running swarm is a new pane
  and gets the seat that is right now, not the one that was right at spawn.
  (Answers are memoized for 20 seconds, so two adds in quick succession share
  one ranking — provider windows do not move on that timescale.) Credentials
  inside an already-running pane are never rotated.
- **An unreadable pool skips those panes, loudly.** If caam is missing, times
  out, or ranks the pool and finds nothing with included headroom, no agent is
  launched into the affected panes and the reason is printed (and reported in
  `seat_skips` under `--json`). In `ntm add` the pane is never created at all;
  in `ntm spawn` the panes were already split before seats were resolved, so a
  refused one is left as a plain shell and named in the warning. Siblings on a
  provider that answered still come up: `ntm add --cod=2 --cc=2` with an
  exhausted Codex pool brings up the two Claude panes. A skipped pane never
  falls through to a static profile pin — that fallthrough is the failure this
  exists to prevent.
- **`ntm scale` honors it too.** Scale-up reports the number of panes that
  actually launched, not the number requested, and surfaces each refusal.
- **Only Claude and Codex are affected.** `caam limits` answers for no other
  provider, so gemini/grok/ollama/plugin panes are untouched.

`seat_selection` is unrelated to `auto_failover` in the same table, despite
sitting next to it: `auto_failover` swaps the **host** credential mid-session
for a pane that hit a rate limit; `seat_selection` only chooses which account a
**new** pane launches under. Enabling one does not enable the other, and
`seat_selection` starts no caam subprocess when it is off.

Requires caam >= v0.1.19 (the release that added the
`earliest-reset-headroom` rank mode).

### Agent Plugins

Custom agent types load from the `agents/` directory that sits next to the
selected config file: `~/.config/ntm/agents/*.toml` by default,
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ntm/agents/` under an XDG override, or
`<dir-of-config>/agents/` with an explicit `--config`. Each TOML declares a
name/alias (which become `--<name>`/`--<alias>` spawn and `send` selectors), a
command template, and optional `[agent.readiness]` regexes that drive
idle/working/error classification for `status`, `--robot-tail`, and
`--verify-boot` exactly like the built-in agents. NTM never modifies files in
`agents/` — an existing preset you have customised is yours.

A maintained, verified preset for **Oh My Pi (`omp`)** ships in
[`examples/agents/omp.toml`](examples/agents/omp.toml). Setup:

```bash
# One-time: complete OMP's interactive setup BEFORE the first spawn,
# otherwise the first prompt lands in the setup wizard.
omp setup

# Install the preset next to your NTM config, then verify it is visible.
mkdir -p ~/.config/ntm/agents
cp examples/agents/omp.toml ~/.config/ntm/agents/
ntm plugins list
ntm deps -v          # probes `omp (plugin)` on PATH

# Exercise it.
ntm spawn repro --omp=1 --verify-boot
ntm --robot-tail=repro --fresh
ntm send repro --omp "Reply exactly NTM_OMP_OK"
```

Model and thinking overrides render through the preset's command template
(e.g. `--omp=1:MODEL`); omitting a default model in the preset deliberately
lets OMP's own configuration choose.

## Design Principles

### No Silent Data Loss

Stateful operations are designed to leave artifacts behind: checkpoints, timelines, audit
records, pipeline state, and serialized robot/API responses.

### Graceful Degradation

Optional integrations such as Agent Mail, `bv`, `cass`, or worktree helpers make NTM stronger,
but the system is designed to remain locally useful without pretending missing tools are present.

### Idempotent Orchestration

Robot mode, durable stores, and resumable workflows are designed so operators and agents can
re-issue state queries and recover from interruptions without inventing undocumented side channels.

### Recoverable State

Sessions, pipelines, attention feeds, approvals, and history all have explicit recovery paths.

### Auditable Actions

NTM favors explicit logs, status surfaces, and durable state over invisible orchestration magic.

### Safe by Default

Destructive operations, guard rails, and approval workflows are treated as core product behavior,
not bolt-on scripts.

## Installation

### Install Script

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/main/install.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --easy-mode
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install dicklesworthstone/tap/ntm
```

### Docker

Multi-arch images (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) are pushed to GitHub Container
Registry by the release workflow, tagged by semver (`1`, `1.22`, `1.22.0`) and
commit SHA:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/dicklesworthstone/ntm:1
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/dicklesworthstone/ntm:1
```

Or build locally:

```bash
docker build -t ntm .
docker run --rm -it ntm
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm.git
cd ntm
go install ./cmd/ntm
```

## Troubleshooting

### `tmux not found`

Install `tmux` first, then re-run:

```bash
ntm deps -v
```

### Agent panes start empty or an agent CLI fails immediately

NTM can only launch tools that are installed and discoverable in `PATH`.
Use `ntm deps -v` to check what it sees.

### `claude`, `codex`, `agy`, `grok`, or `gemini` not detected over SSH / tmux / non-login shells

NTM discovers agent CLIs via the `PATH` of the **runtime environment it is launched in** —
not the `PATH` of your interactive login shell. Tools installed under npm-global or
`~/.local/bin` are often added to `PATH` by your `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` / `~/.profile`,
which a non-interactive or non-login shell (a bare SSH command, a detached tmux server, a
systemd unit, a CI runner) does not source. In that case `ntm deps -v` reports the agents as
missing even though they work fine in your normal terminal.

First, confirm what *NTM's* environment actually resolves, under the same shell/SSH/tmux
context where you run NTM:

```bash
command -v claude
command -v codex
command -v agy
command -v grok
command -v gemini
ntm deps -v
```

If those `command -v` checks come up empty here but succeed in your interactive shell, the
fix is to put the missing directories on `PATH` before launching NTM. The most robust option
is a small wrapper that exports the right `PATH` and then `exec`s NTM (paths vary by host):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ~/bin/ntm-wrapper — ensure agent CLIs are on PATH, then hand off to ntm.
export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
exec ntm "$@"
```

Make it executable (`chmod +x ~/bin/ntm-wrapper`) and invoke that instead of `ntm`. Re-run
`ntm deps -v` through the wrapper to confirm all listed CLIs are now detected.

### A work command has nothing useful to say

`ntm work ...` depends on running inside a repo with Beads/BV data available.
If you are outside the project root, change directories or bootstrap the repo first.

### Mail, locks, or overseer commands say the server is unavailable

Those surfaces depend on Agent Mail being configured and reachable. NTM will still work for
session orchestration without it.

### Pipeline resume or cleanup does not see the state you expect

Make sure the relevant session/project is using the intended project directory. Project-scoped
state lives under that directory's `.ntm/` tree.

## FAQ

### Does NTM replace tmux?

No. NTM is a structured orchestration layer on top of `tmux`.

### Can I use it with one agent instead of a swarm?

Yes. It is perfectly fine to start with one Claude or Codex pane and only scale up when needed.

### Do I need every optional integration?

No. Core session management works with `tmux` and your agent CLIs. Work triage, Agent Mail,
CASS, and safety extras become available as those tools are configured.

### Is robot mode the preferred automation surface?

For local scripting and agent workflows, yes. For long-lived integrations, dashboards, and
service-style consumers, use `ntm serve` and the OpenAPI-backed REST/WebSocket surfaces.

### Can multiple swarms work on the same project?

Yes. Labels, Agent Mail, file reservations, worktrees, and assignment flows are designed for that.

### Does NTM preserve history and state?

Yes. Checkpoints, pipeline state, audit records, timelines, history, and event streams are all part
of the normal product model.

## Limitations

- NTM is intentionally `tmux`-centric.
- Linux and macOS are the primary environments.
- Some advanced workflows depend on external tools such as Agent Mail, `br`, `bv`, `cass`, or worktree helpers.
- Grok Build support is currently phase one: launch/discovery/counting work, while authenticated TUI readiness, automated prompt delivery/assignment, interrupt-with-message, restart, and restore-time relaunch are deliberately unsupported and fail closed.
- The system is local-first. It is not a hosted SaaS control plane.

## Development

Build and verification:

```bash
go build ./cmd/ntm
go test -short ./...
golangci-lint run
```

Regenerate the OpenAPI document:

```bash
ntm openapi generate
```

## About Contributions

*About Contributions:* Please don't take this the wrong way, but I do not accept outside contributions for any of my projects. I simply don't have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the thing, so I'm responsible for any problems it causes; thus, the risk-reward is highly asymmetric from my perspective. I'd also have to worry about other "stakeholders," which seems unwise for tools I mostly make for myself for free. Feel free to submit issues, and even PRs if you want to illustrate a proposed fix, but know I won't merge them directly. Instead, I'll have Claude or Codex review submissions via `gh` and independently decide whether and how to address them. Bug reports in particular are welcome. Sorry if this offends, but I want to avoid wasted time and hurt feelings. I understand this isn't in sync with the prevailing open-source ethos that seeks community contributions, but it's the only way I can move at this velocity and keep my sanity.
