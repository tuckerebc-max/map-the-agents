This work explores the potential of LLMs as task-tutoring agents. We take coding tutoring as a representative scenario, then propose Trace-and-Verify (**Traver**), an effective agent workflow that incorporates knowledge tracing and turn-by-turn verification, to tackle key challenges in coding tutoring. While this work focuses on coding tutoring as an example, the proposed method extends beyond coding to other task-tutoring scenarios, where the tutor must adapt content to users' varying levels of background knowledge. We further introduce Dialogue for Coding Tutoring (**DICT**), a novel evaluation protocol combining student simulation and coding tests to assess tutoring performance. Such automated evaluation is critical for developing task-tutoring agents as it supports a systematic development and evaluation cycle.

- [2025.02.18] 🚀 Release this work on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13311).


## Environment Setup

1. Please follow the instructions of [EvoCodeBench](https://github.com/seketeam/EvoCodeBench) to download EvoCodeBench-2403 dataset, then build the execution environment based on [Environment Setup](https://github.com/seketeam/EvoCodeBench?tab=readme-ov-file#environment-setup). Note that this will cost a few hours to build the execution environment.

2. For this `Coding-Tutor` project, please install the required packages as follows:
    ```bash
    conda create -n coding-tutor python=3.10
    conda activate coding-tutor
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

                    "tutor": "Hello! How familiar are you with OpenGL texture updates and the use of PyTorch tensors in Python?"
                },
                {
                    "student": "Hello! I'm familiar with OpenGL texture updates and the use of PyTorch tensors in Python, but I'm still learning. I appreciate ..."
                },
                {
                    "tutor": "Great start! In the function, when `w` and `h` are not provided or are zero, we should set them to the object's width and height (`self.W` and `self.H`). Also, ... How would you implement these steps in the function?"
                },
                ...
            ]
        }
        ...
    ]

## Analysis of Simulated Students
Under a controlled setup, simulated students at different levels demonstrate distinct abilities in completing target coding tasks. Our DICT protocol serves as a feasible proxy for human evaluation, offering its advantages of scalability and cost-effectiveness for evaluating tutor agents.
