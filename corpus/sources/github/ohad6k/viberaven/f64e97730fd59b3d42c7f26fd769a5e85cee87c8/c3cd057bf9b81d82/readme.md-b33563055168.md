VibeRaven is an open-source local cockpit for AI-built apps. Run `npx -y viberaven` in your repo and it connects your coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) to the context it patches blind without, your architecture, providers, and releases, then shows what is actually safe to ship to production, auth, RLS, webhooks, deploy, before real users hit it. Local-first, no login.

```bash
npx -y viberaven
```

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/viberaven-demo.gif" alt="VibeRaven Studio in motion: chat with your coding agent using manga provider cards, the live release map, and Codex / Claude Code / Gemini driven from one local cockpit" width="100%" />
</div>

## Your stack, as a hand of cards

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/cards-binder.png" alt="VibeRaven Cards Binder — your providers dealt as a manga trading-card hand: Supabase, Vercel, GitHub, Stripe, Sentry, Clerk, Resend and more, black-and-white with gold foil" width="100%" />
</div>

VibeRaven deals your providers as a hand — each one graded, each one a card you play into your agent's next move. Supabase, Vercel, GitHub, Stripe, Sentry, Resend, Clerk, Upstash, and more.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/provider-cards.png" alt="All ten VibeRaven provider cards — Supabase, Vercel, GitHub, Stripe, Sentry, Resend, Clerk, Auth.js, PostHog, Upstash — each a black-and-white manga trading card" width="880" />
</div>

The Studio opens in your browser and works entirely on your machine: it detects your stack, finds your providers, puts your git releases on a timeline, and gives you a "can I ship?" verdict from offline checks. No login, no API key, no telemetry.

## Your first 5 minutes

1. **Run it.** `npx -y viberaven` in your project folder. The Studio opens in your browser and scans your repo offline.
2. **Read your verdict.** The gate chip and Launch Signals show exactly what blocks launch, ranked. Click any signal, then click **Fix** to hand it to your agent.
3. **Connect your coding agent.** Pick Codex, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI in the chat panel, hit **Test connection**, and choose how much access it gets (`ask`, `approve`, or `full`).
4. **Open the Architecture map.** Pages, API, data, modules, and providers as a live draggable map. Weak boundaries glow red. Click one and press a plain-English action like *"Protect user data (RLS)"* or *"Fix slow queries"*.
5. **Open the Worktree.** Your branches as a real tree. Uncommitted mess? One tap: *Commit with agent*. Branch ready? *Review* explains it in plain language and *Merge* does it safely.
6. **Give your agent the skills.** Install the six-skill pack and the plugin so Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini follow the same senior-engineer loop everywhere:

   ```bash
   npx -y skills add ohad6k/VibeRaven --skill viberaven   # skills.sh pack
   npx -y viberaven init --agents all                     # agent rules in-repo
   ```

Everything the agent needs is also written to `.viberaven/` as markdown and JSON, readable by any tool and versioned by git.

## What the Studio gives you

| Capability | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Agent chat on your repo** | Drive Codex, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI from one cockpit, with connection health and live terminal output. |
| **Access modes** | `ask`, `approve`, or `full`. The mode changes the real agent command it runs, not just the UI copy. |
| **Context you can drag** | Drop a release, a provider card, or production memory into agent chat, so the agent patches with your product's real state instead of guessing. |
| **Versions & releases** | Release diffs, tags, changelogs, and "what changed since the last working release" in plain English. |
| **Providers via MCP** | Connect Supabase, Vercel, and Stripe. Provider status flows into agent prompts, and provider proof stays separate from repo-code fixes. |

## The terminal twin: `viberaven check`

For agents and CI, the same verdict as one command:

```bash
npx -y viberaven check
```

```text
viberaven check · ~/my-app

🔴 RLS disabled on public tables  (rls_profiles)
🟡 Service-role key referenced in client bundle  (service_role_client)
⚪ No error monitoring wired  (monitoring_missing)

Verdict: ❌ 1 blocker, 1 warning · score 62
Fix: viberaven fix · Details: .viberaven/agent-tasklist.md
```

One line per finding, `file:line` evidence in the artifacts, exit code `1` on blockers. Then:

```bash
npx -y viberaven fix            # list gaps with safe automatic recipes
npx -y viberaven fix --gap <id> # apply one recipe
npx -y viberaven --strict       # final gate before deploy or CI
```

All results land in `.viberaven/` as markdown and JSON on disk (`agent-tasklist.md`, `gate-result.json`, `context-map.json`), so any agent and your git history can read them.

## Install for AI agents

Make agents use release and provider context before they patch the repo:

```bash
npx -y viberaven init --agents all
npx -y viberaven doctor --agents
```

Preview without writing files:

```bash
npx -y viberaven init --agents all --dry-run
```

This installs bounded rules (`<!-- VIBERAVEN:START -->` ... `<!-- VIBERAVEN:END -->`) into:

- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`
- `.cursor/rules/viberaven-core.mdc` (plus scoped Supabase, deploy, and payments rules)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `.viberaven/agent-context.md`, `.viberaven/mission-map.md`

The rules teach the loop: `check`, read `.viberaven/`, fix one gap, then `check` again until `gate.status === "clear"`.

## Agent skills

Six [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) skills route agents through architecture questions, version evidence, and launch proof:

| Skill | Job |
| --- | --- |
| `viberaven` | The router: local check/fix loop, Studio, and MCP context. |
| `architecture-context` | Ask the missing product questions before any edit. |
| `architecture-plan` | Turn answers plus repo evidence into a workstream plan. |
| `what-broke` | Find which version broke the app before patching. |
| `production-context` | Keep compact production memory in `.viberaven/production-context.md`. |
| `go-live` | Local app to GitHub to Vercel, with live-URL proof. |

```bash
npx -y skills add ohad6k/VibeRaven --skill viberaven
```

See [agent-skills/](./agent-skills/) for the full pack.

This repo also works as an agent **plugin**: `plugin.yaml`, `.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`, and `gemini-extension.json` expose the six skills plus `/viberaven-work`, `/viberaven-help`, `/viberaven-production-context`, and `/viberaven-launch` commands to Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI.

## MCP

VibeRaven is listed in the MCP registry for agents that prefer tools over terminal commands:

```json
{ "viberaven": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "viberaven", "--mcp"] } }
```

Key tools: `viberaven_check_readiness` (runs the local check), `viberaven_heal_apply`, `viberaven_verify`, `viberaven_audit`, `viberaven_provider_verify`, and `viberaven_validate_npm_package` (run it before adding npm dependencies).

## Vercel + Supabase

```bash
npx -y viberaven audit --vercel-supabase
```

Local evidence checks for RLS proof, service-role exposure, and pooler ports before you claim "production ready."

## Philosophy

- **Local-first.** The CLI and Studio run on your machine. No login, no API key, no telemetry, no scan quota.
- **Markdown on disk.** All context lives in `.viberaven/` as plain files that your agent and your git history can read.
- **Evidence over vibes.** Findings point at repo evidence. Provider dashboard state is never claimed from repo edits alone.
- **Non-destructive.** Fix recipes are guarded, cleanup is plan-only, and nothing is pushed or deployed for you.
