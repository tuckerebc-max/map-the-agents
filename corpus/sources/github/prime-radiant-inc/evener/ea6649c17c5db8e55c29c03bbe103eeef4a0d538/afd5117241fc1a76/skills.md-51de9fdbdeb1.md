# Skills and Slash Commands

Evener has two kinds of reusable markdown prompts: **skills** and **slash
commands**. Both are plain text templates. What differs is where they come
from, how they are invoked, and — critically — whether they can execute
shell commands.

## The trust model, up front

A markdown template that can run shell commands is code. Evener's rule:

- **Templates you explicitly installed** (plugins) may execute shell at
  expansion time. Installing a plugin is a trust decision, like installing
  software.
- **Templates evener discovers automatically** (project and user-global
  `skills/` directories, project `.evener/commands/`, and your user-global
  commands directory) never execute shell and never read files at expansion
  time. Anything in a repo you merely cloned is inert text.

This mirrors codex's posture: in codex, skills and custom prompts are always
inert, and skill bodies reach the model only through the model's own
permission-checked tool calls. Claude Code instead allows `!`cmd``
execution in skills and commands, but gates project-sourced content behind a
workspace trust dialog and offers a `disableSkillShellExecution` kill
switch. Evener keeps Claude Code-compatible execution for explicitly installed
plugins, and adopts the codex posture for everything it discovers on its
own.

| Source | Discovered from | `$ARGUMENTS` | `!`cmd`` | `@file` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Skill | skills bundled with evener; user-global `skills/`; project `skills/` dirs (git root→cwd); `skills_dirs`; plugins | no | never | never |
| Evener-wide command | `.evener/commands/` (git root→cwd), `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/evener/commands/` (`~/.config` fallback) | yes, inert text | never — stays literal | never — stays literal |
| Plugin command | plugins you installed or configured | yes, inert text | executes (10s timeout, output bounded) | inlines files at cwd-relative paths (symlinks followed) |

Argument substitution is safe in every row: `$ARGUMENTS` and `$1..$9` are
always substituted as inert text and can never become a live directive, even
in plugin commands.

## Skills

A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter
(`name` and `description` required, `allowed-tools` optional). Evener
discovers skills from the set bundled with evener itself (the base layer),
from `skills/` directories walking the git root down to your cwd, from the
automatic user-global `skills` directory, from any `skills_dirs` launch-config
entries, and from plugins. Among the bare-named sources, later ones shadow
earlier ones by name: a project or `skills_dirs` skill overrides a bundled or
automatic user skill of the same name, and a `skills_dirs` skill overrides a
project skill of the same name. Plugin skills are namespaced
(`plugin:skill`) and never shadow a bare-named skill — invoke them by qualified
name, or by bare name when no bare-named skill has it.

Skill bodies are loaded as text and injected for the model to follow. Evener
performs no expansion on them: no shell execution, no file inclusion, no
argument substitution.

## Evener-wide slash commands

A evener-wide slash command is a markdown file — frontmatter optional — in one
of two places:

- `<any dir from git root to cwd>/.evener/commands/name.md` (project commands)
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/evener/commands/name.md` or `~/.config/evener/commands/name.md`
  (user-global commands)

The filename is the command name. Names cannot contain whitespace
(invocation parses the name up to the first space, so a spaced name can
never run) or colons (`:` is the plugin-namespace separator; evener skips
such files with a warning). Invoke it by typing `/name args` in a session. Optional
frontmatter: `description`, `argument-hint`, `model`, `allowed-tools` (the
last two are parsed but not enforced; evener warns when they appear).

Expansion substitutes `$ARGUMENTS` and `$1..$9` as inert text. `!`cmd``
spans and `@file` references in a evener-wide command body never execute or
read anything — they remain in the expanded text verbatim except that
argument substitution still applies inside them as inert text — and evener
warns at load time if a evener-wide command contains `!`` spans. If you want
an executable template, package it as a plugin command instead.

**Precedence:** project > user-global > plugin. A evener-wide command shadows
a plugin command of the same bare name; the plugin command stays reachable
as `/plugin:name`. Within project commands, the directory closest to your
cwd wins.

### Client caveats

- Both desktop surfaces intercept their own built-in slash commands before
  your input reaches the session: the TUI has its registry (`/status`,
  `/model`, `/help`, ...) and the web palette has its own, partly different
  set (`/status`, `/model`, `/help`, `/steer`, `/queue`, ...). A command
  whose name collides with a client's built-ins is unreachable in that
  client's typed input — pick another name. Headless input always works.
- The web UI opens its command palette when you type `/` into an empty
  composer. The palette lists plugin and user-global commands (badged by
  source) alongside the built-ins. If the name you typed isn't exactly one
  of the palette's commands, Enter sends it to the session as-is — a fuzzy
  near-miss (say `/stat` for `status`) still reaches your command. Project
  commands invoke through that fallthrough.
- Standalone skills are not command-file entries in the command catalog, but an
  exact `/skill-name` token is recognized by the session when that skill is
  loaded and activates the skill body. Skill names and descriptions are shown
  in the model's skill catalog.

## Plugin commands

Plugins (installed via the marketplace or configured via `plugin_dirs`) may
ship `commands/*.md` files. These are Claude Code-compatible: in addition
to `$ARGUMENTS` substitution, ``!`cmd` `` spans execute in the session
environment and `@file` inlines files at working-directory-relative paths
(the constraint is lexical; symlinks are followed). Only install
plugins you trust — a plugin command's body runs shell commands with the
same permissions as the session.

Plugin commands are namespaced: `/plugin:name`. The bare `/name` form
resolves to the plugin command when no evener-wide command shadows it and no
client built-in intercepts it (the client caveats above apply to plugin
commands too). If two plugins define the same command name, the bare form
resolves to one of them — which one is not guaranteed; use the qualified
form to be sure.

## Security checklist for command authors

- Treat every `.evener/commands/` file in a repo you did not write as
  untrusted text. Evener guarantees it cannot execute, but its contents still
  become prompt text for the model — read it before invoking it.
- Never put secrets in command bodies; they are sent to the model verbatim.
- If you need shell output in a prompt, prefer a plugin command (explicit
  trust) over asking users to paste output manually.
