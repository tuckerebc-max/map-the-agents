# Agent Instructions

## Testing

Before adding or changing tests, read `docs/developing-evener/testing.md`.
For the rest of the dev-facing docs (building, linting, coverage, fuzzing,
environment, worktrees), see `docs/developing-evener/README.md`; for every
`make` target with a one-line summary, run `make help`.

Default tests must be deterministic. Do not make `make test` or
`go test ./...` depend on provider credentials, network access, quota, current
model behavior, or ambient developer machine state.

The gates: `make lint` (golangci-lint across every module, TOML naming,
tagged compile floors, generated-output freshness, secret scan), `make vet`,
`make test` (all modules + the frontend gate). `make merge-approval-gate`
is the canonical pre/post-merge sequence. Tool versions are pinned in
`.tool-versions` — `make tools` installs what CI runs.

Use this boundary:

- Evener plumbing: use a scripted provider at the LLM boundary and exercise real
  Evener code below it. Examples: CLI wiring, appwire RPC, daemon queues, session
  loops, tool execution, transcript writes, event emission, goal continuation
  routing, hook dispatch, and prompt composition.
- Model behavior or provider API behavior: keep it live, but require explicit
  opt-in such as `EVENER_LIVE_TESTS=1` or `EVENER_*_E2E=1` in addition to the
  provider credential.

A provider API key by itself must never cause default tests to issue live
requests.

## Frontend gates

Before the gate, run `npx biome check --write` on touched frontend files
under `src/` and on touched files in the AppWire TypeScript package. Biome's
enforced scope is those two directories (the gate runs `biome ci src
../../../appwire-client/typescript`; see cmd/evener-hub/frontend/package.json)
— files outside them, such as the `scripts/layoutguard` harness HTML,
deliberately reproduce component markup that trips a11y lint rules, so an
explicit-path Biome run over them reports violations the gate does not
enforce. Do not "fix" those to satisfy an
out-of-scope invocation. Use `make test-web` as the canonical frontend unit,
typecheck, and Biome gate; on Chrome-capable hosts, also run `make
test-web-browser` for real geometry and browser guards. CI checks Biome
formatting. Avoid `noNonNullAssertion` and array-index-key violations.
