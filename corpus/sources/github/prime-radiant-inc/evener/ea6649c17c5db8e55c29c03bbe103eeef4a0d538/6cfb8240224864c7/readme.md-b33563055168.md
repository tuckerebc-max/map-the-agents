# Evener

A coding agent run through a hub. The `evener hub` orchestrator serves the
web UI — Evener's default interactive surface — where you start sessions,
watch the agent read files, run commands, and edit code, and steer it with
follow-up messages. The hub tracks many concurrent sessions at once, and
`evener tui` gives the same hub a terminal dashboard. A non-interactive
command line handles scripting and automation.

**New here? [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) walks from
install to your first session.**

Evener uses the LLM's native tool-calling and supports OpenAI, Anthropic,
Google, and [other providers](docs/llm-providers.md). For how the code is
organized, see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md). For the runtime
contracts that subagents, plugins, and hooks operate under, see
[docs/subagent-runtime-contracts.md](docs/subagent-runtime-contracts.md). For
background jobs, see [docs/job-control.md](docs/job-control.md). To confine a
session's file, process, and network access with `--sandbox`, see
[docs/sandboxing.md](docs/sandboxing.md). For how sessions are titled, see
[docs/session-auto-naming.md](docs/session-auto-naming.md). To build, test, and lint this repo,
see [docs/developing-evener/README.md](docs/developing-evener/README.md) — or
run `make help` for every target with a one-line summary.

## Install

Install the latest release on Linux x64 or macOS Apple silicon:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prime-radiant-inc/evener/main/install.sh | sh
```

The installer verifies the release archive's SHA-256 checksum and installs
`evener`, `evener hub`, `evener tui`, `evener doctor`, and `evener migrate`
under `~/.local/share/evener/bin`, symlinked into `~/.local/bin`. Make sure
`~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH`.

From a source checkout:

```bash
make install
```

For tagged releases, snapshot builds, alternate prefixes, and a system-style
install under `/usr/local`, see
[docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md#install). Verify any install
with `evener --version`.

Upgrade `evener`, `evener hub`, `evener tui`, and `evener doctor` with
`evener upgrade`. The command follows the binary's install channel: release
builds upgrade to the latest release, and snapshot builds upgrade to the latest
successful `main` build. Pass `release`, `snapshot`, or a tag such as `v1.2.3`
to switch tracks. `evener migrate` is not updated by `evener upgrade`; rerun
the installer, or run `make install` (or `sudo make install-system`), to refresh
it. The TUI and web UI expose the same mechanism through their `/upgrade`
command.

On first use, Evener creates:

- `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/evener/run` for live daemon rendezvous
  files and per-daemon logs.
- `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/evener/auth-token` for the local hub/TUI
  bearer token.
- `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/evener/projects/<project-id>/` for saved
  per-project session state. The project ID is readable (derived from the
  canonical project path) and ends with a 10-character base62 suffix.
- `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/evener/skills` for standalone user skills,
  discovered automatically.
- `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/evener/plugins` for user plugins.

The user skill and plugin directories are extension roots. Standalone user
skills and user-global commands are enabled automatically. Add additional
standalone skill paths to `skills_dirs` and plugin paths to `plugin_dirs` in
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/evener/launch.toml`, or pass them with the
corresponding CLI flags for a single run. Plugin-contained skills live under
that plugin and become available through the plugin path. User-global slash
commands are read automatically from
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/evener/commands` when present.
Install does not create provider credentials. Hosted/auth-required providers
can be configured through the hub or TUI credentials UI, supported provider
environment variables such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or OpenAI OAuth (which signs
in to the separate `openai-codex` instance, not `openai`). Local/auth-none
providers such as Ollama may not need credentials. The default credentials file
is `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/evener/credentials.toml`; when
`EVENER_PROVIDERS_CONFIG` points to a custom `providers.toml`, the credentials
file is beside it unless `EVENER_CREDENTIALS_CONFIG` names a different one. See
[docs/developing-evener/environment.md](docs/developing-evener/environment.md)
for the complete environment variable reference.

## Quick start: the hub and web UI

Start the hub:

```bash
evener hub
```

The hub listens on `127.0.0.1:9180` and prints an authorization URL at
startup:

```
[hub] auth URL (visit once per browser): http://127.0.0.1:9180/auth/<token>
```

Open that URL. It sets a cookie that authorizes the browser; later visits to
`http://127.0.0.1:9180` need no token. For a hosted provider that requires a
credential, add it at `http://127.0.0.1:9180/credentials`; local/auth-none
providers such as Ollama can skip this step. Then open
`http://127.0.0.1:9180/new`, type a prompt, pick a model and working
directory, and click Start. The full walkthrough — resume, forking, and
search included — lives in
[docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md).

## Evener Hub (Web Orchestrator)

`evener hub` runs alongside `evener serve` daemons and gives you a single
browser-based interface for many concurrent sessions.

### Build & run

From a source checkout, run `make build-hub`, then `./evener` (default
`127.0.0.1:9180`). Installed users can run `evener hub` from `PATH`.

### What's there

- **Sidebar** with a Live section (running sessions, excluding archived ones,
  sorted by who needs you) and a Projects section (sessions grouped by
  canonical project identity, not raw working-directory strings; subagents are
  indented under the session that spawned them).
- **Workspace pane** with a two-tier conversation: messages (user pills + assistant body) at the primary reading tier, tool calls and diffs as muted margin annotations.
- **New session** at `/new` — prompt-first, pick model and working dir, click Start.
- **Fork from here**: every message you sent carries a fork button. Click it to branch the session at that point; the original message lands in the composer for you to edit, and the original line is preserved as a sibling fork.
- **Aside**: `/aside` (TUI) or the *Aside: fork to side thread* palette command (web UI) forks the current session at its tip into a side thread with the same permissions and config — for asking a distracting question without derailing the main session.
- **Transparent resume**: click any closed session, type, send. The daemon spawns from where it left off — same identity throughout.
- **⌘K search** (Ctrl+K on Linux) across live + past sessions.
- **Settings** for theme (light/dark/system), notification preferences, and provider and MCP configuration.

### Configuration and operation

The hub uses layered launch configuration, loopback defaults, capability-token
authentication, and XDG state/config roots. For the authoritative configuration,
credential, smoke-check, remote-operation, and deploy guidance, see
[`docs/evener-hub.md`](docs/evener-hub.md) and
[`docs/evener-hub-remote-operations.md`](docs/evener-hub-remote-operations.md).

Design spec, plans, and notes live under `docs/superpowers/`.

## Evener TUI (Terminal User Interface)

`evener tui` is a hub-backed terminal dashboard for Evener sessions. It connects to `evener hub`, lists live and saved sessions, lets you drill into a transcript, and sends session actions through the hub API.

### Build

```bash
make build
```

### Usage

Start the dashboard from an installed `PATH` command:

```bash
evener tui
```

After `make build` in a source checkout, use `./evener` instead.

By default `evener tui` connects to `http://127.0.0.1:9180`. If no local hub is
running, it starts `evener hub` automatically and waits for an authenticated
AppWire `/rpc` connection. When `--state-dir` is explicit, it also checks
`/api/health` for state-environment compatibility.

Connect to a specific hub:

```bash
evener tui --hub-addr http://127.0.0.1:9180
```

Use a specific hub binary or disable auto-start:

```bash
evener tui --hub-bin /path/to/evener-hub
evener tui --no-auto-start-hub
```

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--hub-addr <url>` | Hub URL or host:port (default: `127.0.0.1:9180`) |
| `--hub-bin <path>` | Hub binary to auto-start when the local hub is down |
| `--no-auto-start-hub` | Fail instead of starting a missing local hub |
| `--auth-token <token>` | Hub capability token (overrides the token file and env var) |
| `--state-dir <path>` | Override the Evener state directory |
| `--log-file <path>` | Write auto-started hub logs to this file |
| `--debug` | Disable the alternate screen |

### Features

- **Dashboard**: Browse live and saved sessions from the hub roster and past-session index
- **Session drill-in**: Open a session transcript from the dashboard
- **Hub actions**: Send input, view tasks/details, interrupt, compact, clear, and switch models through hub endpoints
- **Streaming**: Follow session AppWire streams through the hub
- **Markdown rendering**: Format-aware display of assistant messages
- **Tool inspection**: Collapse/expand tool calls and view arguments

## Non-interactive CLI

Use the `evener` command directly for one-shot, non-interactive runs —
scripts, CI, and pipelines where no human steers the session. For interactive
work, prefer the hub and web UI above.

```
evener --model <provider/model> [flags] <prompt>
```

The prompt can be passed as arguments or piped via stdin:

```bash
# Prompt as arguments
evener --model openai/gpt-5.2 "add input validation to the signup handler"

# Prompt piped via stdin
echo "refactor auth to use JWT" | evener --model anthropic/claude-opus-4-6
```

Shell commands run by the agent normally end with their Evener session. When
a command must outlive the session, the agent passes `mode: "detached"` to
its shell tool and redirects the command's own logs:

```json
{"command":"long-task > /tmp/long-task.log 2>&1","mode":"detached"}
```

### Provider and model

Evener takes a provider-qualified model in one value: `--model <provider/model>`. Every provider with a resolvable credential is usable with no config file: `anthropic`, `openai-codex`, `openai`, `google`, `groq`, `zai`, `deepseek`, `openrouter`, `xai`, `mistral`, `cerebras`, `togetherai`, `moonshotai`, `kimi-for-coding`, `minimax`, `zai-coding-plan`, `google-vertex-anthropic`, `google-vertex`, `google-vertex-express`, `amazon-bedrock`, `azure`, `ollama`. A `providers.toml` entry adds anything else. See [docs/llm-providers.md](docs/llm-providers.md).

Use `--model` or set `EVENER_MODEL` to the same `provider/model` format.

For local models via Ollama, see [docs/ollama.md](docs/ollama.md).

### Environment variables

See [docs/developing-evener/environment.md](docs/developing-evener/environment.md) for the complete list. Common
variables:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `EVENER_MODEL` | Default model as `provider/model` (used when `--model` is omitted) |
| `EVENER_REASONING_EFFORT` | Default reasoning effort |
| `EVENER_PROVIDERS_CONFIG` | Path to `providers.toml`. Set and empty means "no user layer" — see [docs/llm-provider-config-and-launch.md](docs/llm-provider-config-and-launch.md) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API key |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter API key |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | Ollama base URL (default `http://localhost:11434/v1`) |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | Ollama host (Ollama's canonical env var; used if `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` is unset) |
| `OLLAMA_API_KEY` | Optional API key for authenticated Ollama proxies / Ollama Cloud |

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--model <provider/model>` | LLM model identifier (required unless resuming an existing session) |
| `--dir <path>` | Working directory (default: current directory) |
| `--enabled-plugins <name,...>` | Load exactly these plugins for this new session, chosen by manifest name from explicit plugin directories and installed plugins (including ones whose default is off); an empty value loads none |
| `--output-schema <json>` | Inline JSON Schema replacing the default `communicate.output` schema |
| `--verbose` | Emit NDJSON events to stderr (replaces human-readable output) |
| `--resume <id>` | Resume a previous session by ID |
| `--resume-with <id>` | Start a new prompt using a previous session's context |
| `--resume-last` | Resume the most recent session |
| `--list-sessions` | List saved sessions and exit |

### Per-session plugin selection

Inspect the plugins a new direct-CLI session loads by default with:

```bash
evener plugin list --effective --json
```

To allow only particular manifest names for one new session, pass a
comma-separated list. An explicit empty value loads no plugins:

```bash
evener --enabled-plugins=alpha,beta "task"
evener --enabled-plugins= "task"
```

Omitting `--enabled-plugins` uses the current defaults: explicit plugin
directories plus installed plugins marked enabled by default. The flag is
new-session-only and cannot replace the plugin set of an existing resumed
session. It selects manifest names from the otherwise-loadable set of explicit
plugin directories and installed plugins, so naming an off-by-default installed
plugin turns it on for that session. The selected set is stored with the new
session, so resumes, forks, and delegates inherit it.

This does not change persistent plugin state. `evener plugin enable` and
`evener plugin disable` set whether an installed plugin loads by default in
future sessions.

### Structured output

Pass `--output-schema <json>` to replace the `communicate` tool's `output` field schema with your own. The flag takes an inline JSON string (file paths are not supported).

```bash
evener --model openai/gpt-5.2 \
  --output-schema '{"type":"object","properties":{"plan":{"type":"string"}},"required":["plan"],"additionalProperties":false}' \
  "Draft a one-paragraph plan for fixing the flaky test."
```

The supplied schema replaces `output` wholesale — the default `message`/`data`/`artifacts` shape is removed. Provider-specific caveats:

- **OpenAI** rewrites `additionalProperties: true` to `false` and expands `required` to cover every property in the schema (strict mode).
- **Anthropic** strips `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf` at the top level of the output schema.
- **Gemini** drops `additionalProperties` during sanitization.

### Output

**stdout** always receives only the final result text.

**stderr** shows progress in one of two modes:

**Default (human-readable):**
```
[model] gpt-5.2 (openai)
[tool] write_file {"file_path":"/tmp/test.txt","content":"he...
[tool] write_file: done
[assistant] I've created the file for you.
[thinking] (247 chars)
[usage] in=1234 out=567 total=1801
```

**`--verbose` (NDJSON):** Each event is a JSON object on one line, suitable for piping to `jq` or log aggregation:
```bash
evener --model openai/gpt-5.2 --verbose "fix the bug" 2>events.ndjson
```

NDJSON events include: `SESSION_START`, `ASSISTANT_TEXT_END` (with usage, reasoning, finish_reason), `TOOL_CALL_START` (with arguments), `TOOL_CALL_END`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and others.

### Session persistence

Evener auto-saves session state under
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/evener/projects/<project-id>/sessions/`
after each assistant turn. This enables resuming interrupted work.

Project IDs are shared by a repository's main checkout and linked worktrees:
they aggregate into the same project bucket. A distinct clone has a different
canonical path and therefore gets a distinct project ID and state bucket.

Session IDs are 22-character UUIDv7 base62 payloads. Domain-specific IDs that
retain a prefix keep that prefix outside the payload (for example, `job_` IDs).

The identifier format change is a clean break. Evener does not migrate or delete
inert old project/session state; remove obsolete state manually after checking
that it is no longer needed. Installation IDs are the sole automatic legacy
replacement: an invalid stored installation ID is replaced when Evener next
needs one.

```bash
# List saved sessions
evener --list-sessions

# Resume the most recent session
evener --resume-last

# Resume a specific session
evener --resume 02wLIRxqmq3AUo6vl2OW37

# New prompt, but carry forward a previous session's conversation context
evener --model openai/gpt-5.2 --resume-with 02wLIRxqmq3AUo6vl2OW37 "now add tests"
```

Resume reuses the original session's provider and model; override them with `--model <provider/model>`.

## llmcall (One-Shot LLM Client)

This repo also includes `llmcall`, a minimal CLI wrapper around the unified `llm` library for single “throwaway” calls.

Properties:

- Exactly one LLM call (no agent loop).
- Tool calls are forbidden (`tool_choice=none`). If the model returns tool calls, `llmcall` fails.
- No system prompt by default. You can optionally provide one, or force-disable with `--no-system`.

Build:

```bash
make build-llmcall
```

Examples:

```bash
./llmcall --provider openai --model gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07 "Write a haiku about build pipelines."

# JSON mode: parses and re-prints as JSON (fails if output isn't valid JSON)
echo 'Return JSON: {"ok": true}' | ./llmcall --provider openai --model gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07 --format json

# JSON Schema mode: enforces + validates structured output
./llmcall --provider openai --model gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07 --schema /path/to/schema.json "Return an object matching the schema."
```

`llmcall` resolves provider/model from env if omitted:

- `LLM_PROVIDER` or `EVENER_PROVIDER`
- `LLM_MODEL` or `EVENER_MODEL`
