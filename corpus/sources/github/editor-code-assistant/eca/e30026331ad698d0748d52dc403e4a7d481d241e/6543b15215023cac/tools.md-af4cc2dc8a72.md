# Tools

![](../images/features/tools.png)

ECA supports 3 types of tools:

- __Native tools__: (edit_file, write_file, read, etc)
- __MCP servers__: if any configured
- __User custom tools__: if defined

## MCP

For MCP servers configuration, use the `mcpServers` config, examples:

=== "Stdio"

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "memory": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
          // optional
          "env": {"FOO": "bar"}
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "HTTP (streamable or sse)"

    ECA supports OAuth authentication automatically via MCP spec discovery.

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "cool-mcp": {
          "url": "https://my-remote-mcp.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "OAuth with pre-registered client"

    Some providers (e.g. Databricks) require a pre-registered OAuth application
    and don't support dynamic client registration. Use `clientId` with the
    client ID from your provider's OAuth app settings.

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "databricks-sql": {
          "url": "https://my-workspace.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0/mcp/sql",
          "clientId": "<your-oauth-app-client-id>"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Confidential OAuth (e.g. Slack)"

    Some providers (e.g. Slack MCP) require confidential OAuth with both a
    `clientId` and `clientSecret`, and require HTTPS pre-registered redirect URIs.

    Setup steps:

    1. Create a Slack App at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
    2. Enable MCP under *Features > Agents & AI Apps*
    3. Under *OAuth & Permissions > Redirect URLs*, add
       `https://localhost:19284/auth/callback`
    4. Add the user scopes you need (e.g. `search:read.public`, `channels:history`)
    5. Copy the credentials from *Settings > Basic Information > App Credentials*

    When `oauthPort` is set, ECA uses a bundled localhost certificate to serve
    HTTPS on the callback. On first authorization, your browser will show a
    certificate warning — click *Advanced → Proceed* to complete the flow.

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "slack": {
          "url": "https://mcp.slack.com/mcp",
          "clientId": "<your-slack-app-client-id>",
          "clientSecret": "<your-slack-app-client-secret>",
          "oauthPort": 19284
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Static auth header"

    For servers that accept a static token (e.g. a personal access token),
    set the `Authorization` header directly. This skips OAuth entirely.

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "my-api": {
          "url": "https://my-remote-mcp.com/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:MY_API_TOKEN}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "You.com web search & research"

    [You.com](https://you.com/?utm_source=editor-code-assistant-eca&utm_medium=2026-08-oss-integrations&utm_content=docs) provides web search, URL content extraction, and AI-powered research via MCP.

    **Option 1: Authenticated (full features)**
    
    Get your API key from [you.com/api](https://you.com/api?utm_source=editor-code-assistant-eca&utm_medium=2026-08-oss-integrations&utm_content=docs) and set it as `YDC_API_KEY` environment variable:

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "you-search": {
          "url": "https://api.you.com/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:YDC_API_KEY}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Option 2: Keyless (basic web search)**
    
    Try You.com search without an API key using the free profile:

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "you-search-free": {
          "url": "https://api.you.com/mcp?profile=free"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Option 3: Specialized profiles**
    
    Use focused endpoints for specific domains:

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "you-finance": {
          "url": "https://api.you.com/mcp?tools=you-finance",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:YDC_API_KEY}"
          }
        },
        "you-docs": {
          "url": "https://you.com/docs/_mcp/server"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Available tools include `you_search` (web search with citations), `you_url_contents` (webpage content extraction), and `you_research` (multi-step research workflows).

=== "Advanced — DCR client name override"

    Some OAuth-protected MCP servers allowlist clients during Dynamic Client
    Registration (DCR) by `client_name`. If the server rejects ECA's default
    registration with a 403, set `clientName` to a value the server accepts.

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "figma": {
          "url": "https://mcp.figma.com/mcp",
          "clientName": "Claude Code"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    The DCR attempt, its result and the chosen `client_name` are logged at
    `info`/`warn` level so you can verify behavior in the ECA log.

=== "Per-project auth — authScope"

    By default a server's OAuth token is shared across every project, which is
    convenient when the same account is used everywhere. If you sign in to a
    *different* account (e.g. a different Linear workspace) per project, the
    shared token would otherwise be clobbered. Set `authScope` to control this:

    - `global` (default): one token shared across all projects.
    - `workspace`: a separate token per workspace folder set.
    - any other value: a named bucket shared by every project using that value.

    ```javascript title="myproject/.eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "linear": {
          "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp",
          "authScope": "workspace"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Like other config values, `authScope` supports the full dynamic-string
    interpolation (`${env:...}`, `${file:...}`, `${cmd:...}`, `${netrc:...}`,
    `${classpath:...}`), e.g. `"authScope": "${env:LINEAR_ORG}"`.

=== "Disabling a MCP"

    Set `"disabled": true` to keep the configuration but prevent ECA from starting the server.

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "memory": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
          "disabled": true
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Custom Tools

You can define your own command-line tools that the LLM can use. These are configured via the `customTools` key in your `config.json`.

The `customTools` value is an object where each key is the name of your tool. Each tool definition has the following properties:

-   `description`: A clear description of what the tool does. This is crucial for the LLM to decide when to use it.
-   `command`: An string representing the command and its static arguments.
-   `schema`: An object that defines the parameters the LLM can provide.
    -   `properties`: An object where each key is an argument name.
    -   `required`: An array of required argument names.

Placeholders in the format `{{argument_name}}` within the `command` string will be replaced by the values provided by the LLM.

=== "Example 1"

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "customTools": {
        "web-search": {
          "description": "Fetches the content of a URL and returns it in Markdown format.",
          "command": "trafilatura --output-format=markdown -u {{url}}",
          "schema": {
            "properties": {
              "url": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The URL to fetch content from."
              }
            },
            "required": ["url"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Example 2"

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "customTools": {
        "file-search": {
          "description": "${file:tools/my-tool.md}",
          "command": "find {{directory}} -name {{pattern}}",
          "schema": {
            "properties": {
              "directory": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The directory to start the search from."
              },
              "pattern": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The search pattern for the filename (e.g., '*.clj')."
              }
            },
            "required": ["directory", "pattern"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Spawned command environment

Processes spawned by ECA (`shell_command` foreground and background commands, the `git` tool, custom tools, and [hooks](hooks.md)) run with these extra environment variables, so external tooling (shell history, wrappers, audit scripts) can tell agent-spawned commands from human ones:

| Variable | Value | When |
|----------|-------|------|
| `ECA_AGENT` | `1` | Always |
| `ECA_CHAT_ID` | The id of the chat that triggered the command | When triggered from a chat (`shell_command`, `git`, custom tools) |
| `ECA_EXECUTABLE` | The launch command of the running ECA process | Always |

Detection contract: a non-empty `ECA_AGENT` means the command was spawned by ECA.

## Disabled tools

You can completely disable tools so they are never available to the LLM. This is configured via the `disabledTools` config, which accepts a list of strings matched against each tool, in this order:

1. A builtin ECA tool name or regex, no `eca__` prefix needed: `edit_file`, `.*_file`.
2. An exact MCP server name, disabling all tools of that server: `clojure-mcp`.
3. A regex matched against the tool full name `server__tool`: `clojure-mcp__eval.*`, `my-mcp__dangerous_tool`.

Regexes must match the whole name (anchored). It can be set globally, per agent or in the [agent markdown frontmatter](agents.md).

=== "Global"

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "disabledTools": ["eca__shell_command", "my-mcp__dangerous_tool"]
    }
    ```

=== "Per agent"

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "agent": {
        "plan": {
          "disabledTools": ["eca__edit_file", "eca__write_file", "eca__move_file"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Whole MCP server per agent"

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "clojure-mcp": {"command": "..."}
      },
      "agent": {
        "plan": {
          "disabledTools": ["clojure-mcp"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

!!! tip "Disabled vs Denied"

    `disabledTools` removes the tool entirely from the LLM — it won't even know it exists. `toolCall.approval.deny` rules without `argsMatchers` also remove the tool from the LLM tool list, while rules with `argsMatchers` keep the tool visible and only block matching calls.

## MCP tool search

Every tool sent to the LLM costs context: its description and full input schema are part of each request. With a few MCP servers connected that easily adds up to thousands of tokens the model rarely needs.

MCP tool search trades that upfront cost for an extra round trip. Matching tools are *deferred*: their schemas are **not** sent to the model, only a compact catalog of names and truncated descriptions in the system prompt. When the model needs one, it calls the `eca__search_tools` tool, which loads the matching tools — from then on they are sent as regular tools and can be called normally.

Loading is per chat and sticks for the rest of it, including every follow-up request ECA makes while the model works through a chain of tool calls. Tools you never search for stay withheld for the whole conversation.

This is configured via `mcpToolSearch`, and is off until you turn it on:

- `deferAllWhenTotalTokensExceedPercentOfContext`: defer **all** MCP tools once their definitions outgrow this percentage of the model's context window. `null` by default, meaning never.
- `includePattern`: MCP tools to put behind the search tool regardless of that limit.
- `excludePattern`: MCP tools to keep loaded, taking precedence over both.

So a tool is deferred when it is over the automatic limit **or** matches `includePattern`, and does not match `excludePattern`.

The two patterns use the same matching as [`disabledTools`](#disabled-tools) — an exact MCP server name (all its tools) or an anchored regex against the tool full name `server__tool`.

=== "Defer once MCP gets expensive"

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpToolSearch": {
        "deferAllWhenTotalTokensExceedPercentOfContext": 10
      }
    }
    ```

    On a 200k model this defers every MCP tool once their definitions pass ~20k tokens, and leaves them loaded below that. Percentage rather than a fixed token count so the same setting behaves sensibly on a 32k local model and a 1M model.

=== "Defer all MCP tools"

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpToolSearch": {
        "includePattern": [".*"]
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Defer all but one MCP server"

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpToolSearch": {
        "includePattern": [".*"],
        "excludePattern": ["clojure-mcp"]
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Defer one noisy MCP server"

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "mcpToolSearch": {
        "includePattern": ["some-mcp__.*"]
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Per agent"

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "agent": {
        "plan": {
          "mcpToolSearch": {
            "includePattern": [".*"],
            "excludePattern": ["some-mcp__read_.*"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

Both lists are merged from the global config and the agent config, and everything here can also be set in the [agent markdown frontmatter](agents.md#mcp-tool-search). `deferAllWhenTotalTokensExceedPercentOfContext` is a single value rather than a list, so an agent's value replaces the global one; set it to `null` on the agent to opt that agent out.

!!! info "Native tools are never deferred"

    Only MCP tools can be deferred. ECA's [native tools](../features.md#native-tools) are the agent's baseline capabilities, so a catch-all `".*"` never takes them away. Use [`disabledTools`](#disabled-tools) to remove a native tool. They are also left out of the `deferAllWhenTotalTokensExceedPercentOfContext` total, so the limit tracks what MCP actually adds.

!!! note "Models without a known context window"

    `deferAllWhenTotalTokensExceedPercentOfContext` needs the model's context window to compute a budget. When ECA does not know it, nothing is deferred automatically — use `includePattern` if you want deferral on such a model.

`eca__search_tools` is only offered to the model when at least one tool is actually deferred.

!!! tip "Disabled vs Deferred"

    `disabledTools` makes a tool unusable. `mcpToolSearch` keeps it fully usable, it just costs the model one `eca__search_tools` call to load it.

## Approval / permissions

By default, ECA asks to call any non read-only tool (check the [default rules](#default-approval-rules)), but that can easily be configured in several ways via the `toolCall.approval` config:

- `byDefault`: `"ask"`, `"allow"` or `"deny"`, used when no rule matches. Default: `"ask"`.
- `deny`, `ask` and `allow`: maps of [tool selector](#tool-selectors) to an optional [`argsMatchers`](#matching-arguments-with-argsmatchers).

!!! tip
    Approval rules are enforced by the ECA process itself. For OS-level isolation on top of them, check [Sandboxing](./sandboxing.md).

Check some examples:

=== "Allow any tools by default"

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "toolCall": {
        "approval": {
          "byDefault": "allow"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Allow all but some tools"

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "toolCall": {
        "approval": {
          "byDefault": "allow",
          "ask": {
            "eca__edit_file": {},
            "my-mcp__my_tool": {}
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Ask all but all tools from some mcps"

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "toolCall": {
        "approval": {
          // "byDefault": "ask", not needed as it's eca default
          "allow": {
            "eca": {},
            "my-mcp": {}
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Matching by a tool argument"

    __`argsMatchers`__ is a map of argument name by list of [java regex](https://www.regexplanet.com/advanced/java/index.html).

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "toolCall": {
        "approval": {
          "byDefault": "allow",
          "ask": {
            "shell_command": {"argsMatchers": {"command": [".*rm.*",
                                                               ".*mv.*"]}}
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Denying a tool"

    ```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
    {
      "toolCall": {
        "approval": {
          "byDefault": "allow",
          "deny": {
            "shell_command": {"argsMatchers": {"command": [".*rm.*",
                                                           ".*mv.*"]}}
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

Also check the `plan` agent which is safer.

__The `manualApproval` setting was deprecated and replaced by the `approval` one without breaking changes__

### How ECA decides: rule precedence

For each tool call, ECA checks the following in order, and the first match wins:

1. __`deny` rules__: always win, even over session-remembered approvals and trust mode.
2. __Session-remembered approvals__: what you approved with "approve and remember for this session" ([below](#approve-remember-for-this-session)).
3. __Tool built-in checks__: some native tools force asking in risky cases regardless of `allow` rules, e.g. filesystem tools and `shell_command` when the path or working directory is outside the workspace roots.
4. __`ask` rules__.
5. __`allow` rules__.
6. __Legacy `manualApproval` config__.
7. __`byDefault`__: `ask` when not set.

Trust mode is applied after that: it promotes an `ask` result to auto-allow but never overrides `deny`.

!!! warning "Agent rules replace global rules"

    `agent.<name>.toolCall.approval` does not deep-merge with the global `toolCall.approval` at runtime: each key present (`allow`, `ask`, `deny` or `byDefault`) entirely replaces the global one. Since the builtin `plan` and `explorer` agents define their own `allow` and `deny` ([default rules](#default-approval-rules)), global `allow` entries you add are ignored while using those agents — configure `agent.plan.toolCall.approval.allow` too if you need them there.

### Tool selectors

The keys of `allow`, `ask` and `deny` are matched by exact name (no regex or glob, unlike `disabledTools`), in one of 3 forms:

| Selector | Matches |
|----------|---------|
| `server__tool`: `eca__shell_command`, `my-mcp__my_tool` | that specific tool |
| builtin tool name: `shell_command` | the ECA native tool, the `eca__` prefix is optional for them |
| server name: `my-mcp`, `eca` | all tools of that server |

For MCP tools the `server__` prefix is required: a bare MCP tool name like `my_tool` is treated as a server name and will match nothing — use `my-mcp__my_tool`.

### Matching arguments with argsMatchers

`argsMatchers` is a map of argument name by list of [java regexes](https://www.regexplanet.com/advanced/java/index.html) tested against the argument value:

- Regexes are anchored, they must match the __whole__ argument value: `"rm"` does not match `rm -rf foo`, use `".*\\brm\\b.*"`.
- The rule matches when __any__ regex of any listed argument matches.
- A rule without `argsMatchers` matches __every__ call of that tool.
- Matchers of an argument absent in the call never match.
- A `deny` rule without `argsMatchers` also hides the tool from the LLM entirely; with `argsMatchers` the tool stays visible and only matching calls are rejected.

#### Chained and piped shell commands

Config `argsMatchers` are tested against the __full command string__ — there is no per-command splitting: for `cat file | grep foo`, an `allow` regex must match that whole string. That's why deny patterns are usually written like `".*\\b(rm|mv|cp)\\b.*"`. Splitting a chain into individual commands only happens for [session remember](#approve-remember-for-this-session).

### Approve & remember for this session

When you approve a tool call choosing "approve and remember for this session", ECA whitelists that tool by name: future calls of it are auto-approved. Remembered approvals live in memory only — they apply to all chats of the running ECA process, are not written to any config file, and are lost on restart. `deny` rules still win over them.

#### Granular approve & remember for shell commands

When you approve a `eca__shell_command` or `eca__git` tool call choosing "approve and remember", ECA remembers the approved commands for the session instead of whitelisting the whole tool: the command string is parsed and each command in a chain (`&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`) produces a key — command + subcommand for multi-command tools (`git checkout`, `npm install`), the plain command otherwise (`rg`). A future shell call runs automatically only when all its commands were already remembered.

ECA fails closed: commands it cannot safely reason about always ask again, like command/process substitution (`$(...)`, backticks), subshells, heredocs, output redirections to files (except `/dev/null`), and wrapper commands that execute arbitrary code (`sudo`, `bash -c`, `xargs`, `env`, ...).

### Trust mode by default

Trust mode auto-accepts all tool calls in a chat (it never overrides `deny`). Editors expose a toggle for it, and you can make **new chats start trusted** for every editor via `chat.defaultTrust`:

```javascript title="~/.config/eca/config.json"
{
  "chat": {
    "defaultTrust": true
  }
}
```

### Default approval rules

Globally ECA allows its read-only builtin tools and asks for everything else:

```javascript
{
  "toolCall": {
    "approval": {
      "byDefault": "ask",
      "allow": {
        "eca__compact_chat": {},
        "eca__preview_file_change": {},
        "eca__read_file": {},
        "eca__directory_tree": {},
        "eca__grep": {},
        "eca__editor_diagnostics": {},
        "eca__skill": {},
        "eca__task": {},
        "eca__ask_user": {},
        "eca__fetch_rule": {},
        "eca__spawn_agent": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The builtin `plan` and `explorer` agents replace these with stricter rules: `allow` only covers the read-only builtin tools plus read-only shell commands (`pwd`, `git diff/log/show`, `find`, `ls`), and `deny` blocks dangerous shell patterns (file mutations like `rm`/`mv`/`cp`/`touch`/`mkdir`, output redirections, pipes to `tee`/`dd`/`xargs`, in-place `sed`/`awk`/`perl`, `git add/commit/push`, `npm install`). Check the up-to-date values in [config.clj](https://github.com/editor-code-assistant/eca/blob/master/src/eca/config.clj).

### Debugging approval rules

Start the server with `--log-level debug` ([how to per editor](../troubleshooting.md)) and search the logs for `Tool call approval decision`, logged on every tool call with the decision and which rule caused it:

```
[CHAT] Tool call approval decision {:decision :deny, :rule {:source :config-deny, :selector "eca__shell_command", :args-matcher ".*\\b(rm|mv|cp|touch|mkdir)\\b.*"}, :tool "eca__shell_command", :agent "plan"}
```

| `:source` | The decision came from |
|-----------|------------------------|
| `:config-deny`, `:config-ask`, `:config-allow` | your `approval` rules; `:selector` and `:args-matcher` show the exact rule |
| `:session-remember` | an "approve and remember for this session" approval |
| `:tool-built-in-check` | the tool itself, e.g. path outside the workspace roots |
| `:legacy-manual-approval` | the deprecated `manualApproval` config |
| `:by-default` | the `byDefault` config |
| `:fallback` | nothing matched (likely a config error), falls back to ask |

Common reasons ECA still asks after you added an `allow` rule:

- The regex must match the whole argument: use `"grep(\\s+.*)?"` instead of `"grep"`.
- Allowing `eca__grep` doesn't cover `grep` run through `eca__shell_command` — they are different tools.
- You are on the `plan`/`explorer` agent (or a custom one) whose `allow` replaces the global one.
- The path or working directory is outside the workspace roots (`:tool-built-in-check`).
- Chained commands: the regex must match the full chained string, e.g. `cat file | grep foo`.
