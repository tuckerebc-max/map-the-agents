## About This Book

The AI landscape is shifting from passive, reactive systems to autonomous, goal-directed intelligent agents—systems that perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions with minimal human intervention. This book presents **30 essential agent architectures** that every AI engineer must master to build effective, production-ready systems.

Raw LLMs alone are not enough. The key to building transformative AI systems lies in understanding how to architect agents that decompose complex tasks, connect to external tools and data sources, maintain memory across interactions, collaborate with humans and other agents, learn from experience, and make ethical decisions aligned with human values.

Each chapter includes **working code**, **formal architectural patterns**, **real-world case studies**, and guidance on avoiding common implementation pitfalls. Every pattern has been tested against the production realities of latency, cost, reliability, and security that define real-world deployments.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is for **AI engineers**, **software developers**, **ML researchers**, and **technical leads** building intelligent systems. It's ideal for those deploying LLM-powered applications or transitioning from traditional ML to agentic frameworks. Python experience and basic ML knowledge are recommended.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/30-Agents-Every-AI-Engineer-Must-Build.git
cd 30-Agents-Every-AI-Engineer-Must-Build

# Navigate to a chapter
cd chapter05

# Install base dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install your chosen provider's dependencies
pip install -r requirements-openai.txt    # For OpenAI GPT-4o
pip install -r requirements-claude.txt    # For Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4
pip install -r requirements-gemini.txt    # For Google Gemini Flash 2.5
pip install -r requirements-ollama.txt    # For local Ollama (no API key)

# (Optional) Configure your API key for Live Mode
cp .env.template .env
# Set ONE of: OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or GOOGLE_API_KEY

# Launch the notebook
jupyter notebook ch05_foundational_architectures.ipynb
```

### Software and Hardware Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **OS** | macOS, Windows, or Linux |
| **RAM** | 8 GB minimum; 16 GB recommended |
| **Python** | 3.10 or later |
| **GPU** | NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12+ (recommended, not required) |
| **Tools** | git, terminal, virtual environment tool (venv, conda, or uv) |
| **API Keys** | **None required** — every chapter runs in Simulation Mode with built-in MockLLM responses. Optional: OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google API key unlocks Live Mode. Local Ollama requires no key. |
| **Ollama** | Optional — for local LLM mode: [install Ollama](https://ollama.com), then `ollama pull deepseek-v2:16b` and `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`. 16 GB+ RAM recommended. |

### Choose Your LLM Provider

Every chapter includes **five pre-executed notebook variants** — pick the one that matches your setup:

| Notebook Suffix | Provider | API Key | Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| `__RUN_NO_KEY_SIMULATION` | None (MockLLM) | None | Built-in chapter-derived mock responses |
| `__RUN_OPENAI_GPT4o` | OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini |
| `__RUN_CLAUDE_Sonnet4` | Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude Sonnet 4 |
| `__RUN_GEMINI_Flash25` | Google | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Gemini Flash 2.5 |
| `__RUN_LOCAL_OLLAMA_DeepSeek_V2_16B` | Ollama (local) | None | DeepSeek V2 16B + Llama 3.1 8B embeddings |

All five variants produce equivalent pedagogical output with identical cell structure. Every notebook is pre-executed with outputs saved, so you can browse them directly on GitHub without running any code.

- **No setup at all?** Open the `__RUN_NO_KEY_SIMULATION` notebook — it runs entirely on MockLLM with no dependencies.
- **Want real LLM output?** Set one API key in `.env` and open the matching notebook.
- **Prefer local inference?** Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com), pull the models, and open the `__RUN_LOCAL_OLLAMA_DeepSeek_V2_16B` notebook — no API key, no cloud calls, everything stays on your machine. See [LOCAL_LLM_SETUP.md](chapter01/LOCAL_LLM_SETUP.md) for step-by-step instructions on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Which provider is best?** See the **[LLM Provider Comparison Summary](LLM_COMPARISON_SUMMARY.md)** for head-to-head results across all 17 chapters with Bloom's taxonomy analysis, visualizations, and per-domain recommendations.
