# Browser Agency Plan

This document plans an interactive, agent-driven browser capability on top of
the existing `web` crate. The goal is **browser agency**: the agent navigates,
clicks, types, and observes real web applications across many tool calls, with a
**human-in-the-loop login handoff** so the agent can reach authenticated state
("act as me") without the model ever seeing credentials, 2FA codes, or client
certificates.

Two consumer stories drive it:

- **code-assistant** tests web software under development (localhost, mostly no
  or trivial auth, ephemeral profiles fine).
- **pal** performs real tasks on real portals under the user's identity (e.g.
  the Elster tax portal), which requires persistent authenticated sessions and
  gated outward actions.

The engine is generic and lives upstream; both consumers register the same
tools. This matches the carve-out direction (generic tools shared, domain logic
per app).

## Where we are today

`web` (`crates/web/src/client.rs`) is a **read-only scraper**, not an agent:

- `WebClient` holds a single headless `Browser` plus a `reqwest` client.
- `search()` uses HTTP against DuckDuckGo — it doesn't touch the browser.
- `fetch()` opens a throwaway `new_page`, extracts the main content, converts
  HTML → Markdown, and **discards the page**. No click/type/screenshot, no page
  that survives across calls.
- The profile lives in a `TempDir` (`_user_data_dir`) that is **deleted on
  drop**. Cookies, localStorage, and session tokens do not survive the process.

Two structural facts block agency, and the second is the root cause of "I can't
log in as me":

1. **Stateless & headless.** One page per call, no interaction surface, no
   vision (screenshots).
2. **Ephemeral profile.** Even a successful login is wiped when the process
   ends.

Neither is a flaw — the crate was built for research/fetch. Agency is a new
capability alongside it.

## Design principles

1. **The model never authenticates.** It does not type passwords, TOTP codes, or
   handle the Elster certificate/ElsterSecure app. Authentication is always
   performed by the human, in a visible browser window. The agent only operates
   on the *resulting* authenticated session.
2. **Login is a rare event, not a per-run cost.** Persistent named profiles keep
   the session alive between runs; re-login happens only when the cookie
   actually expires.
3. **Same shape as PTY sessions.** An interactive browser session is a
   long-lived handle the agent drives across tool calls, held in an id-keyed,
   per-agent-session registry — exactly the `pty_session` pattern (see
   `docs/pty-sessions.md`).
4. **Actions with external effect are `outward`.** Reads/navigation/screenshots
   are `read_only`; submitting a form, filing a return, posting — anything a
   third party sees — is `outward`, so the existing permission tiers gate them
   with no new mechanism (see `docs/permission-tiers.md`).

## Architecture

### Engine (Layer 0)

Grow the `web` crate (it already owns `chromiumoxide`) with an interactive
session module — or add a sibling crate `browser_session` mirroring
`pty_session` one-to-one. Recommended: **extend `web`** to avoid a second
chromiumoxide dependency and keep the browser stack in one place.

```
BrowserSession          // one persistent Page/BrowserContext, survives tool calls
BrowserSessionManager   // id-keyed registry, LRU cap, one per agent session
BrowserProfile          // named, persistent user-data-dir + headful/headless policy
```

`BrowserSession` surface (all async, thin wrappers over chromiumoxide CDP):

| Method | Purpose | Tag |
|---|---|---|
| `navigate(url)` | go to a URL, wait for load | `read_only` |
| `screenshot()` | full-page or viewport PNG → vision content | `read_only` |
| `read()` | accessibility tree / trimmed DOM / text for the model | `read_only` |
| `click(selector \| coords)` | click an element | context-dependent |
| `type(selector, text)` | type into a field (never credentials) | context-dependent |
| `press(key)` | keyboard key (Enter, Tab, …) | context-dependent |
| `wait_for(condition)` | wait for selector / navigation / timeout | `read_only` |
| `eval(js)` | run JS in the page, return JSON | context-dependent |
| `login_handoff(url)` | headful, pause for the human, resume authenticated | `read_only` |
| `close()` | drop the session | `read_only` |

**Vision is mandatory for real portals.** Elster (and most rich SPAs) cannot be
driven reliably from DOM→Markdown; the model must *see* the page. `screenshot()`
returns image content into the transcript (the LLM layer already supports
multimodal input). DOM/AX-tree reads complement it for precise selectors.

### Profiles & persistence

Replace the `TempDir` with a **named, persistent profile directory**, e.g.
`~/.code-assistant/profiles/<name>` (pal: `$PAL_HOME/profiles/<name>`). A profile
carries cookies/localStorage/passkeys, so:

- Log in once (headful, human) → the `elster` profile is authenticated.
- Every later run with that profile starts already authenticated, until expiry.
- Profiles are portable: the same directory copied to another machine carries
  the session with it (see pal/NUC below).

Keep an **ephemeral profile** option (today's `TempDir` behavior) as the default
for code-assistant's throwaway test runs.

### The login handoff primitive

`login_handoff(url)` is the heart of "act as me". Flow:

1. Agent opens/ensures a **headful** window on the named profile and navigates
   to `url`.
2. Agent **pauses the turn** and emits a confirmation-style request through the
   existing `PermissionMediator` seam: *"Please log in in the browser window,
   then confirm."*
3. The **human** performs the full login in the real window — password, 2FA,
   certificate, whatever the site demands. The model sees none of it.
4. Human confirms (allow) → agent resumes in the same, now-authenticated page.
   Deny → agent aborts the flow.
5. The session cookie now lives in the persistent profile; subsequent runs skip
   the handoff until expiry.

This reuses the same seam as pal's outward-confirmation round-trip — it is a
"wait for the human at the browser" prompt rather than a yes/no, but travels the
same channel (TUI prompt port / Telegram inline keyboard).

### Tools (code_assistant_core)

Add `code_assistant_core::tools::impls::browser_*` tools, each a `DynTool` over
`BrowserSessionManager`, registered in `register_default_tools()`:

- `browser_open` (open/attach a session on a named profile), `browser_navigate`,
  `browser_screenshot`, `browser_read`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`,
  `browser_wait`, `browser_eval`, `browser_login_handoff`, `browser_close`.
- Capability tags per the table above; submit-style actions carry `outward`.

Because the tools are generic, **pal inherits them** through the shared registry
— no pal-specific tool code, only pal-specific profiles and gating.

### Power-user escape hatch: attach to an existing Chrome

chromiumoxide can `Browser::connect(ws_url)` to a running Chrome started with
`--remote-debugging-port`. This gives the agent the user's *real* browser with
every existing login, zero handoff. Offer it as an explicit opt-in (a profile
kind `Attach { ws_url }`), **not** the default — the agent then shares the live
browser and can act on everything, which is the wrong default for autonomous,
identity-bearing tasks. The dedicated persistent profile is safer and
reproducible.

## pal / NUC specifics

pal targets the NUC (replacing hermes). Key updated fact: **the NUC has a
monitor attached on demand — it is not permanently headless.** That collapses
the earlier "headless NUC" constraint:

- pal can run the **same `login_handoff` primitive locally on the NUC**: when
  auth is needed, pal opens the headful window on the NUC's display and notifies
  the user over Telegram (*"please come to the NUC and log in to Elster, then
  confirm"*), using the existing channel + confirmation seams. The user walks
  over, logs in, confirms via the Telegram inline keyboard (or a local confirm),
  pal resumes.
- **Profile transfer is now optional, not required.** If the user prefers, they
  can still do the one-time headful login on the laptop and copy the `elster`
  profile directory to the NUC — useful when nobody is at the NUC — but it is a
  convenience path, not the primary mechanism.
- **Outward gating already exists.** Filing the return (submitting on Elster) is
  `outward`; pal's outward-confirmation interceptor prompts before it fires. No
  new mechanism.

This also corrects an earlier assumption recorded for pal: **headless-CDP
browser use with a pre-authenticated profile is a good fit for the NUC**, unlike
full desktop computer use (mouse/keyboard/whole-screen), which was rightly
deferred. Browser agency and desktop computer use are different capabilities;
this plan covers only the former.

## Rollout (suggested checkpoints)

**Status (2026-07-12):** checkpoints 1–4 landed on `feature/browser-agency`
(engine + tools + login handoff, all with tests), plus three capability
follow-ups: **CP-A** scroll action + full-page screenshot, **CP-B** interactive
element/selector discovery in `observe`/`read`, **CP-C** coordinate-based
interactions (`click_at`, `move_at`, selector-less `press`), **CP-D** unit-bearing
coordinates (`"40vw"`/`"50%"`/`"640px"`, `rem`/`em` rejected) with the viewport
size disclosed in the observation. Checkpoint 5 (pal wiring) and the
outward-gating note below remain.

Following the repo's TDD/checkpoint working style — each step compiles, is
tested, and is committable on its own:

1. **Persistent profiles.** ✅ Add a profile abstraction to `web`; make the
   user-data-dir named/persistent with the `TempDir` path kept as the ephemeral
   default. Existing `fetch`/`search` behavior unchanged. Tests: profile dir
   created/reused; cookies survive a relaunch (spin a local axum server that
   sets a cookie, as in the existing dev-dependency).
2. **Interactive `BrowserSession` + `BrowserSessionManager`.** ✅ Long-lived
   page, navigate/observe/screenshot/click/type/press/wait/eval/close; id-keyed
   registry with LRU, one per agent session. Tests drive a local axum app.
3. **Browser tools.** ✅ `browser_navigate` / `browser_read` / `browser_act` /
   `browser_close` in `register_default_tools()`, keyed by profile name;
   screenshots return image content via `render_images`. One live browser per
   profile; a named profile persists under `<config_dir>/browser-profiles/<name>`.
   Plus `browser_profiles`: lists the persistent profiles on disk and, for each,
   how long ago it was last logged in and to which site (recorded on a
   successful `browser_login` in a `<name>.meta.json` sidecar, shown humanized
   as "N days ago"). A fresh session has no live browsers, so this is how the
   agent rediscovers an existing login instead of re-prompting the user — the
   "last login" is last-recorded, not a guarantee, so it says "verify by
   navigating".
4. **Login handoff.** ✅ `browser_login`: headful window + pause on the
   `PermissionMediator` seam (pause → human → resume authenticated). Grant/deny
   verified headlessly via an extracted `login_handoff()`. On approval the
   visible window is swapped for a headless browser on the same profile: the
   full cookie jar (incl. in-memory session cookies a disk flush would drop) is
   transferred via CDP, so the login survives and the user can close the login
   window without leaving the manager with a dead session. Chrome locks the
   profile dir, so the swap is close-then-relaunch, not concurrent.
5. **pal wiring.** *(remaining)* pal registers the tools, defines its own
   `browser-profiles` dir, routes the handoff prompt over Telegram, and tags
   consequential browser actions `outward` via its extra-capabilities hook.
   Dogfood the Elster login-and-navigate loop on the NUC.

## Known limitation — outward gating

Capability tags are static per tool, so `browser_act` cannot know per-call
whether a click merely navigates or *submits* (an outward effect). It ships as a
normal write tool (not `read_only`, not `outward`): in code-assistant's default
`bypass-all` tier it runs freely. An embedder that wants consequential browser
actions gated (pal, in `outward-tools` tier) adds the `outward` tag to
`browser_act` through the extra-capabilities hook rather than us hardcoding a
prompt on every click. `browser_login` is the exception — it always prompts, via
its own explicit handoff request, independent of the tier.

## Open questions

- **Selector strategy for the model:** *(resolved — CP-B/C/D)* a mix, as
  expected. `observe`/`read` surface a bounded list of interactive elements with
  CSS selectors (`#id` preferred, else an `:nth-of-type` path) and role/label, so
  the model targets stable selectors; coordinate clicks (`click_at`/`move_at`) and
  selector-less `press` cover canvas/WebGL/game surfaces that have no selectors.
  Coordinates carry a CSS unit resolved against the viewport — `vw`/`vh`/`%` are
  invariant to screenshot resize and DPR (the model can't read the true size off
  a resized screenshot); `px` is exact CSS pixels, groundable because the read
  output discloses the viewport dimensions. `rem`/`em` are rejected (typographic,
  not spatial). A future refinement: include element bounding boxes in the CP-B
  list so `px` clicks can be derived exactly from a rect.
- **Session-expiry detection:** how the agent recognizes it has been logged out
  (redirect to login URL, a known selector) and re-triggers `login_handoff`
  instead of flailing.
- **Handoff timeout policy on the NUC:** how long pal waits for the human before
  giving up / re-notifying — ties into the existing open question about
  unattended permission prompts blocking a lane's turn.
