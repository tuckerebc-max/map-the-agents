## Plugin-Based Setup (since 2026-02-07)

All test repos now use the arckit plugin via the marketplace instead of synced files. Each repo has a `.claude/settings.json` that auto-enables the plugin:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "arckit-claude": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "tractorjuice/arckit-claude"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "arckit@arckit-claude": true
  }
}
```

**What the plugin provides** (no longer synced to test repos):

- Commands, agents, templates, scripts, MCP servers (AWS Knowledge + Microsoft Learn)

**What stays in test repos** (repo-specific content):

- `projects/` (generated architecture artifacts)
- `docs/` (including `index.html`, `README.md`, `guides/`, `manifest.json`)
- `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (repo-specific)
- `.devcontainer/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION`

**Note**: Plugin requires a Claude Code restart after first opening a repo to resolve the marketplace. Plugin updates are picked up automatically from the marketplace repo — no file syncing needed. After updating `pages-template.html` in the plugin, re-run `/arckit:pages` in each repo that has a `docs/index.html` to regenerate it.
