# ArcKit Command Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM)

This matrix shows which commands depend on outputs from other commands.

**Legend:**

- **M** = MANDATORY dependency (command will fail without it)
- **R** = RECOMMENDED dependency (command works better with it)
- **O** = OPTIONAL dependency (command can use if available)
- **Empty** = No dependency

**Reading the Matrix:**

- **Rows** = Commands that produce outputs
- **Columns** = Commands that consume those outputs
- Example: If row "principles" has "R" in column "stakeholders", it means stakeholders RECOMMENDS having principles first

## Command Groups by Dependency Level

### Tier 0: Foundation (No Mandatory Dependencies)

These commands can run first:

- **start** - Onboarding and navigation (console-only diagnostic, no file output; recommends `init` and `principles`)
- **plan** - Project planning and timeline (can optionally read: stakeholders, requirements, principles, sobc, risk if they exist)
- **principles** - Architecture principles

### Tier 1: Strategic Context (Depends on Foundation)

- **stakeholders** → Depends on: principles (R)

### Tier 2: Risk Assessment (Depends on Stakeholders)

- **risk** → Depends on: stakeholders (M), principles (R)

### Tier 3: Business Justification

- **sobc** → Depends on: stakeholders (M), risk (R), principles (R)

### Tier 4: Requirements Definition

- **requirements** → Depends on: stakeholders (R), sobc (R), principles (R)

### Tier 5: Strategic Planning (Platform Strategy, Roadmaps & Strategy Synthesis)

- **platform-design** → Depends on: principles (M), stakeholders (R), requirements (R), wardley (R), risk (O), sobc (O), data-model (O)
  - Note: Designs multi-sided platform strategy using Platform Design Toolkit (PDT) methodology
  - Best run after requirements when designing ecosystem-based platforms (Government as a Platform, marketplaces, data platforms)
  - Can run earlier if stakeholders and principles exist (requirements/wardley are recommended for better auto-population)
- **roadmap** → Depends on: principles (M), stakeholders (R), requirements (R), wardley (R), risk (R)
  - Note: Creates strategic architecture roadmap with multi-year timeline and capability evolution
  - Requires principles as foundation; stakeholders and requirements provide strategic context
- **strategy** → Depends on: principles (M), stakeholders (M), wardley (R), roadmap (R), sobc (R), risk (O)
  - Note: Synthesises strategic artifacts into executive-level Architecture Strategy document
  - Requires both principles AND stakeholders as mandatory inputs (unique among ArcKit commands)
  - Best run after creating principles, stakeholders, wardley, roadmap, and sobc for comprehensive strategy
- **framework** → Depends on: principles (M), requirements (M), stakeholders (R), strategy (R), data-model (R), research (R)
  - Note: Transforms architecture artifacts into a structured, reusable framework with principles, patterns, and implementation guidance
  - Agent-delegating command (runs autonomously via arckit-framework agent)
  - Best run after strategy and requirements when sufficient artifacts exist for framework synthesis
- **glossary** → Depends on: requirements (R), data-model (R), principles (O), sobc (O), research (O), adr (O), strategy (O), risk (O)
  - Note: Generates comprehensive project glossary; accepts all available artifacts as term sources
  - Can run at any point once requirements exist; richer with more artifacts available

### Tier 6: Detailed Design (Depends on Requirements)

Most commands in this tier require or strongly recommend ARC-*-REQ-*.md:

- **data-model** → Depends on: requirements (M), principles (R), stakeholders (R), sobc (O)
- **dpia** → Depends on: data-model (M), requirements (M), principles (R), stakeholders (R), risk (R)
- **research** → Depends on: requirements (M), stakeholders (R), data-model (R), platform-design (R)
  - Note: Also spawns `vendors/{slug}-profile.md` and `tech-notes/{slug}.md` for reusable knowledge (use `--no-spawn` to skip)
- **azure-research** → Depends on: requirements (M), data-model (R), stakeholders (R), MCP Server (External)
  - Note: Requires Microsoft Learn MCP server to be installed for authoritative Azure documentation
- **aws-research** → Depends on: requirements (M), data-model (R), stakeholders (R), MCP Server (External)

  - Requires `TRELLO_API_KEY` and `TRELLO_TOKEN` environment variables

### Tier 11: Operations (Depends on Architecture)

- **servicenow** → Depends on: requirements (M), diagram (M), principles (R), HLD/DLD (R)
- **devops** → Depends on: requirements (M), principles (M), diagram (R), research (R)

### Tier 12: Quality Assurance (Can Run Before or After Compliance)

- **analyze** → Depends on: principles (M), requirements (R), stakeholders (R), all other artifacts (O)
  - Note: Requires principles as foundation; other dependencies are optional - analyze identifies gaps for missing artifacts

### Tier 13: Compliance Assessment (Depends on Multiple Artifacts)

These assess compliance across the project:

- **principles-compliance** → Depends on: principles (M), requirements (R), stakeholders (R), risk (R), data-model (R), platform-design (R), HLD (R), DLD (R), hld-review (R), dld-review (R), traceability (R), dpia (R), tcop (R), secure (R), mod-secure (R)
  - Note: All dependencies except principles are RECOMMENDED - better assessment with more artifacts
- **conformance** → Depends on: principles (M), adr (M), requirements (R), hld-review (R), dld-review (R), principles-compliance (R), traceability (R), HLD (R), DLD (R), risk (O), devops (O)
  - Note: Checks decided-vs-designed conformance — ADR decision implementation, cross-decision consistency, architecture drift, technical debt
  - Bridges health (quick metadata scan) and analyze (deep governance) with systematic conformance checking
- **maturity-model** → Depends on: principles (R)
  - Note: Generates capability maturity model with current-state assessment, target-state definition, and improvement roadmap

### Tier 14: Project Story & Reporting (Depends on All Artifacts)

Final reporting commands that create comprehensive project narratives and presentations:

- **story** → Depends on: principles (M), all other artifacts (R)
  - Note: Requires principles as foundation; recommends multiple artifacts for comprehensive narrative
  - Generates comprehensive historical record with timeline analysis, traceability chains, governance achievements
  - Best run at project milestones or completion when most/all artifacts are complete
- **presentation** → Depends on: all artifacts (R), none mandatory
  - Note: Reads available artifacts and reformats into MARP slide deck for governance boards
  - Supports focus modes: Executive, Technical, Stakeholder, Procurement
  - Can run at any milestone when at least 3 artifacts exist; more artifacts = richer slides

### Tier 15: Documentation Publishing (Utility)

Publishing command that generates documentation site:

- **pages** → Depends on: All document-producing artifacts (R)
  - Note: pages indexes and displays all project documents - more documents = better site
  - Recommended dependencies: principles, stakeholders, risk, sobc, requirements, data-model, dpia, research, wardley, roadmap, adr, sow, evaluate, hld-review, dld-review, backlog, diagram, servicenow, traceability, analyze, principles-compliance, service-assessment, tcop, ai-playbook, atrs, secure, mod-secure, jsp-936, story, presentation, HLD, DLD
  - Generates GitHub Pages site with Mermaid diagram support
  - Best run when project has substantial documentation to publish

### Meta: Build Harness (orchestrator, not in matrix)

`/arckit:build` is a meta-command that orchestrates parallel execution of every other command listed in this matrix according to a YAML recipe. It produces no artifact of its own — it dispatches subagents that each run one of the per-tier commands above.

- **build** → Depends on: a recipe file (`.arckit/recipes/{name}.yaml` or `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/arckit-build/recipes/{name}.yaml`)
  - Built-in recipes: `uk-saas` (31 targets), `uk-mod-sovereign` (32 targets), `uae-federal-ai` (47 targets including a research wave)
  - Computes the dependency DAG from the recipe and dispatches one parallel wave at a time
  - **Claude Code only** — depends on parallel `Agent` tool dispatch
  - Excluded from the matrix above because it depends on every other command transitively

wardley → dos → evaluate → hld-review → dld-review → backlog → servicenow →
devops → operationalize → traceability → tcop → mod-secure → principles-compliance →

```

### MOD Defence AI Project Path

```text
plan → principles → stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements → datascout → data-model → research →
wardley → dos → evaluate → hld-review → dld-review → backlog → servicenow →
devops → mlops → operationalize → traceability → tcop → mod-secure → jsp-936 →
principles-compliance → conformance → analyze → service-assessment → story
```

**Note**: analyze and service-assessment can also run earlier in the workflow to identify gaps in missing artifacts (all their dependencies are optional). The story command can be run at any project milestone to create a narrative snapshot, but is most comprehensive when run after all artifacts are complete. The paths above show the complete workflow with story as the final reporting step.

**Platform Design**: The platform-design command is used when designing multi-sided platforms (Government as a Platform, marketplaces, data platforms) and should be inserted after requirements definition but before detailed design. See "UK Government Platform Strategy Path" above.

## Artifact Dependencies Summary

### Commands That Are Frequently Consumed (High Fan-In)

**ARC-*-REQ-*.md** - consumed by 37 commands:

- data-model (M), data-mesh-contract (M), platform-design (M), dpia (M), research (M), azure-research (M), aws-research (M), gcp-research (M), datascout (M), wardley (M), roadmap (M), adr (M), sow (M), dos (M), gcloud-search (R), gcloud-clarify (M), evaluate (M), hld-review (M), dld-review (M), backlog (M), servicenow (M), devops (M), mlops (M), finops (M), operationalize (M), traceability (R), analyze (R), principles-compliance (M), service-assessment (M), tcop (M), ai-playbook (M), atrs (M), secure (M), mod-secure (M), jsp-936 (M), story (R), pages (R)

**HLD** (external document) - consumed by 7 commands:

- dld-review (M), backlog (M), diagram (R), servicenow (R), traceability (M), hld-review (validates it), service-assessment (M)
  - Note: analyze reads HLD directly if available (O), not via hld-review

**ARC-*-PLAT-*.md** - consumed by 6 commands:

- research (R), wardley (R), diagram (R), analyze (M), principles-compliance (R), service-assessment (R)

### Commands That Produce Critical Artifacts (High Fan-Out)

**requirements** produces ARC-*-REQ-*.md → consumed by 37 commands (highest)
**principles** produces ARC-000-PRIN-v*.md → consumed by 21 commands
**stakeholders** produces ARC-*-STKE-*.md → consumed by 23 commands
**HLD** (external) → consumed by 7 commands
**risk** produces ARC-*-RISK-*.md → consumed by 6 commands
**platform-design** produces ARC-*-PLAT-v*.md → consumed by 6 commands

---

## Design Notes

1. **ARC-*-REQ-*.md is the central artifact** - Nearly all downstream commands depend on it
2. **ARC-000-PRIN-v*.md is the governance foundation** - All design reviews check against principles
3. **Strategic order matters** - stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements ensures business justification before technical work
4. **Platform strategy bridges business and technical** - platform-design sits between requirements (business needs) and design (technical architecture), useful for ecosystem-based platforms
5. **Quality gates can run iteratively** - analyze and service-assessment have optional dependencies, allowing them to run early (identifying gaps) or late (validating completeness)
6. **Compliance assessments feed quality gates** - tcop, ai-playbook, atrs, secure, mod-secure, jsp-936 outputs are optionally consumed by analyze and service-assessment
7. **External artifacts** - HLD and DLD are created outside ArcKit but validated by hld-review/dld-review commands

## Version

- **ArcKit Version**: 1.6.0
- **Matrix Date**: 2026-06-02
- **Commands Documented**: 86
- **Matrix Rows**: 58 (existing) + 18 EU/FR commands in separate section below (see Changelog 2026-04-19)
- **Note**: `/arckit:customize`, `/arckit:template-builder`, `/arckit:health`, `/arckit:search`, `/arckit:impact`, `/arckit:navigator`, `/arckit:graph-report`, `/arckit:init`, `/arckit:start`, `/arckit:export-okf`, and `/arckit:import-okf` are utility/interoperability/diagnostic commands not in the matrix — they have no dependencies and produce no outputs consumed by other commands

## Changelog

### 2026-08-13 - EU Cloud Sovereignty Framework Command (Community) (#740)

Added `/arckit:eu-cloud-sovereignty` to the `arckit-eu` community overlay, taking it from 7 commands to 8. Like the other overlay commands, it is documented here via this changelog rather than as a DSM grid row (the matrix tracks the official baseline). Tier 13 compliance assessment.

**Command and output doc-type**:

- `/arckit:eu-cloud-sovereignty` → `EUCSF` (EU Cloud Sovereignty Framework Assessment, regime EU, category Compliance, severity HIGH)

**Dependencies**: requirements (M — cloud service type, data sensitivity, sovereignty NFRs, member state), risk (R — existing cloud, supply-chain and foreign-interference risks), fr-secnumcloud (R — security qualification status, which is complementary to sovereignty rather than a substitute), principles (R — cloud strategy and foreign-dependency policy from `000-global`), eu-nis2 (O — Article 21 measures overlapping SOV-7), fr-dinum (O), nl-cloud (O — the Dutch policy position, where one is already recorded).

**Consumed by**: `risk` (R — unmet minimum SEAL levels and sovereignty gaps become risk entries), `nl-cloud` (O), `fr-secnumcloud` (O — where a French qualification is also in scope).

**Scope boundary**: the framework supplies the eight objectives, their weights and the SEAL scale; the **contracting authority** supplies the minimum SEAL per objective in the tender specification. The command records an assessment and does not certify — no provider is named as achieving any SEAL level.

**Typical EU cloud sovereignty path**:

```text
requirements → risk →
eu-cloud-sovereignty (minimum SEAL from tender spec, then evidence per objective) →
risk (gaps) → nl-cloud / fr-secnumcloud (national layer, where applicable)
```

### 2026-08-13 - Austrian Accessibility Command (Community) (#710)

Added `/arckit:at-barrierefreiheit` to the `arckit-at` community overlay, taking it from 3 commands to 4. Like the other overlay commands, it is documented here via this changelog rather than as a DSM grid row (the matrix tracks the official baseline). Tier 13 compliance assessment.

**Command and output doc-type**:

- `/arckit:at-barrierefreiheit` → `ATBFR` (Austrian Accessibility Assessment (BaFG / WZG), regime AT, category Compliance, severity HIGH)

**Dependencies**: requirements (M — NFR-UX targets and the user-facing surface inventory), stakeholders (R — assistive-technology users, consumers versus citizens), diagram / hld (R — the actual surfaces), at-bvergg (O — any accessibility clause already imposed on a supplier), risk (O), sobc (O — headcount and turnover, which drive the BaFG microenterprise exemption).

**Consumed by**: `requirements` (O — conformance gaps become NFR-UX items), `at-bvergg` (O — the conformance target is carried into the Leistungsbeschreibung rather than rediscovered at acceptance), `at-dsgvo` (O — where the feedback mechanism processes personal data).

**Scope boundary**: `/arckit:at-bvergg` covers accessibility as a *procurement clause* (§107 BVergG). This command covers the entity's own products, services, websites and apps. The two are complementary and share the same standard version — EN 301 549 v3.2.1, giving WCAG 2.1 AA.

**Typical Austrian accessibility path**:

```text
requirements → stakeholders →
at-barrierefreiheit (applicability: BaFG / WZG / both) →
requirements (NFR-UX gaps) → at-bvergg (remediation procurement) →
traceability
```

### 2026-06-10 - UK G-Cloud Supplier Bid-Authoring Overlay Commands (Community, Proprietary)

Added 11 community-overlay commands shipping in the new 13th marketplace plugin `arckit-uk-gcloud` — a **proprietary (not MIT), Claude Code only** supplier-side overlay for authoring UK G-Cloud (Digital Marketplace) framework bids. It is the 4th sector-specific overlay (after `arckit-uk-finance`, `arckit-uk-nhs`, `arckit-au-energy`) and **requires the `arckit` core plugin**. Unlike every other overlay it is **not distributed to the non-Claude extension formats** (Codex / Gemini / OpenCode / Copilot). Like the other overlays, these commands are documented here via this changelog rather than as DSM grid rows (the matrix tracks the official baseline). Total community-overlay command count moves to **87** (`arckit-uk-gcloud` adds 11), alongside the official baseline.

**Commands and output doc-types** (all regime UK, category Procurement; SDD / DECL / SECA are HIGH severity):

- `/arckit:supplier-profile` → `SUPP` (Supplier Profile)
- `/arckit:service-design` → `SVCD` (Service Design)
- `/arckit:sdd-lot1` → `SDD` (Service Definition Document — Lot 1 Cloud Hosting)
- `/arckit:sdd-lot2` → `SDD` (Service Definition Document — Lot 2 Cloud Software)
- `/arckit:sdd-lot3` → `SDD` (Service Definition Document — Lot 3 Cloud Support)
- `/arckit:declaration` → `DECL` (Supplier Declaration)
- `/arckit:pricing` → `PRIC` (Pricing Document)
- `/arckit:security` → `SECA` (Security Assertions)
- `/arckit:gcloud-competitors` → `GCMP` (G-Cloud Competitor Benchmark)
- `/arckit:review` → `GCRV` (G-Cloud Submission Review)
- `/arckit:submission-pack` — assembles the final G-Cloud submission pack from the above artefacts

**Dependencies**: all 11 commands depend on the `arckit` core plugin (templates, helper scripts, doc-id generation, hooks). Within the overlay, `/arckit:review` and `/arckit:submission-pack` consume the upstream SUPP / SVCD / SDD / DECL / PRIC / SECA / GCMP artefacts (R). `/arckit:gcloud-competitors` (GCMP) optionally informs `/arckit:service-design` and pricing positioning (O).

**Skills**: `gcloud-framework`, `cloud-security`, `sfia-skills`. **Recipe**: `uk-gcloud-submission` (end-to-end bid assembly). Ported from the standalone gcloud-kit plugin.

### 2026-06-02 - Competitor Landscape command + Assurance wiring (#556)

- **Added**: `/arckit:competitors` command (86th ArcKit command) for competitor landscape analysis from the UK Tenders MCP
- **Updated**: Tier 7 Procurement to include competitors command alongside tenders
- **Dependencies**: requirements (O), tenders (O), research (O) — all optional; command can run standalone with only a supplier name, capability keyword, or CPV scope
- **Consumed by**: risk (O — supplier-concentration/single-supplier-dependency risk), sobc (O — market-context benchmark), research (O — award-evidence grounding), score (O — Company Experience evidence)
- **Doc-type produced**: `CMPT` (Competitor Landscape, regime UK) — previously pre-registered; now live
- **Updated**: Commands Documented count from 85 to 86
- **Assurance wiring**: `risk` now accepts TNDR/CMPT as optional inputs for supplier-concentration risk; `sobc` accepts TNDR/CMPT for Economic Case market-context; `research` accepts TNDR/CMPT for award-evidence grounding; `score` accepts CMPT for Company Experience evidence — all regime-gated handoffs (UK Gov `governance_framework`)
- **Note**: Agent-delegating command (reader/orchestrator/writer three-tier split). Shares `arckit-tenders-reader` with `/arckit:tenders` — same MCP reader, different orchestrator/writer lens (supplier-rivalry vs. market-wide). Fits alongside tenders in the optional-input pattern.

### 2026-06-02 - Procurement Market Intelligence command (#556)

- **Added**: `/arckit:tenders` command (85th ArcKit command) for procurement market intelligence from the UK Tenders MCP
- **Updated**: Tier 7 Procurement to include tenders command
- **Dependencies**: requirements (O), sobc (O), research (O) — all optional; command can run standalone with only a keyword or CPV scope
- **Consumed by**: sobc (O — Economic Case benchmarks), risk (O — concentration risk), research (O — build-vs-buy market context)
- **Doc-type produced**: `TNDR` (Procurement Market Intelligence, regime UK)
- **Updated**: Commands Documented count from 84 to 85
- **Note**: Agent-delegating command (reader/orchestrator/writer three-tier split). Requires bundled `uk-tenders` MCP server (keyless, deferred, best-effort). Not added to the main DSM table because it produces no artifact currently consumed as a MANDATORY input by any other command — fits alongside datascout in the optional-input pattern.

### 2026-04-28 - Graph-aware diagnostic commands (#359)

- **Added**: `/arckit:navigator` — project-level GPS. Read-only diagnostic. No dependencies, no outputs consumed by other commands. Listed in the utility/diagnostic exclusion note above; not added to the matrix proper.
- **Added**: `/arckit:graph-report` — multi-project governance metrics dashboard. Read-only diagnostic. No dependencies, no outputs consumed by other commands. Listed in the utility/diagnostic exclusion note above; not added to the matrix proper.
- **Updated**: Commands Documented count from 82 to 84.
- **Note**: Both commands are backed by the consolidated `graph-inject.mjs` hook (#162) which injects pre-computed graph context for read-only commands. They consume *every* artifact in a project, but transitively via the graph — they don't depend on any specific producing command.

### 2026-03-16 - Wardley Mapping Suite

- **Added**: wardley.value-chain command — Depends on: requirements (M), stakeholders (R). Produces WVCH artifacts
- **Added**: wardley.doctrine command — Depends on: principles (M), wardley (R), stakeholders (R). Produces WDOC artifacts
- **Added**: wardley.gameplay command — Depends on: wardley (M), wardley.climate (R), wardley.doctrine (R). Produces WGAM artifacts
- **Added**: wardley.climate command — Depends on: wardley (M), requirements (R), research (R). Produces WCLM artifacts
- **Updated**: Commands documented from 60 to 64

### 2026-03-13 - Dependency Matrix Audit Fixes

- **Fixed**: data-model row — added principles (R) dependency (command reads principles for data governance standards)
- **Fixed**: adr row — changed risk from (O) to (R) (command reads risk register for decision context)
- **Fixed**: data-mesh-contract tier text — removed spurious diagram (R) dependency (command never reads diagrams)
- **Fixed**: devops row — changed principles from (R) to (M), corrected tier text to show principles (M) and diagram (R)
- **Fixed**: dfd row — changed requirements from (M) to (O) (command can generate DFDs from user description alone)
- **Fixed**: diagram row — changed requirements from (M) to (O) (command can generate diagrams from user description alone)
- **Fixed**: traceability row — changed HLD/DLD from (M) to (R) (hook pre-processing reduces direct file read dependency)
- **Updated**: glossary tier text — added optional dependencies (principles, sobc, research, adr, strategy, risk)
- **Updated**: wardley tier text — added optional dependencies (research, data-model, tcop, ai-playbook)
- **Updated**: ARC-*-REQ-*.md consumption count from 38 to 36 (dfd and diagram changed from M to O)
- **Note**: Audit performed by comparing matrix entries against actual command file implementations

### 2026-03-09 - Added Impact Analysis Command

- **Added**: `/arckit:impact` command (60th ArcKit command) for blast radius analysis and reverse dependency tracing
- **Not in matrix**: Diagnostic command with console-only output — no dependencies and no outputs consumed by other commands
- **Updated**: Commands Documented count from 59 to 60

### 2026-05-04 - Canada Federal Overlay Commands (Community)

Added 12 community-overlay commands (`ca-*`) covering federal Canadian regulatory and digital-government instruments. They ship with the `[COMMUNITY]` description prefix and are not part of the officially-maintained baseline. Total command count moves from 104 to 116 (70 official + 46 community).

The 12 commands cover: FITAA (Bill C-70 2024), federal privacy and access (Privacy Act, ATI Act), Treasury Board Directive on Automated Decision-Making, Charter rights design review, ITSG-33 + Standard on Security Categorization, Security of Information Act handling, GC Cloud sovereign residency, GC Digital Standards conformance, Official Languages Act, federal procurement (PSPC + PSAB), and First Nations OCAP® data sovereignty.

**Canonical execution chains**:

```text
Flow 1 — FITAA-class application (registration scheme, scoring, automated triage):
principles → requirements → ca-charter → ca-fitaa → ca-pia → ca-atip → ca-aia (if ADM) → ca-ocap (if Indigenous data)
  → ca-itsg-33 → ca-soia (if classified) → ca-cloud-residency → ca-ola
  → ca-gc-digital-standards → ca-pspc → adr → sobc → risk → framework
```

```text
Flow 2 — generic federal Canadian application:
principles → requirements → ca-pia → ca-atip → ca-aia (if ADM) → ca-ocap (if Indigenous data)
  → ca-itsg-33 → ca-cloud-residency → ca-ola
  → ca-gc-digital-standards → ca-pspc → adr → sobc → risk → framework
```

**Handoff matrix** (extracted from `plugins/arckit-ca/commands/ca-*.md` frontmatter — these are the suggested next commands after each one runs):

| From command | Handoff target | Condition / rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `ca-fitaa` | `ca-charter` | Charter §2 (expression / association) review required for any registration scheme touching protected speech |
| `ca-fitaa` | `ca-pia` | PIA for personal information collected during arrangement registration |
| `ca-fitaa` | `ca-atip` | Reconciles the public-facing register against the protected investigative dataset (severance design for hybrid views) |
| `ca-fitaa` | `ca-aia` | Triggered when registration triage uses automated decision-making, scoring, or risk classification |
| `ca-pia` | `risk` | PIA findings feed privacy and regulatory entries in the risk register |
| `ca-pia` | `ca-atip` | Personal-information disclosure register continues into ATIP reconciliation |
| `ca-pia` | `ca-aia` | Required when ADM touches personal information; AIA inherits the PIA inventory |
| `ca-atip` | `data-model` | Severance rules feed back into data-model classification flags and access controls |
| `ca-atip` | `ca-pia` | PIA personal-information register is the authoritative source for the §4–§8 use/disclosure register |
| `ca-aia` | `risk` | AIA findings — bias, drift, contestability — feed the operational risk register |
| `ca-aia` | `adr` | Material AIA outcomes (vendor selection, autonomy tier, recourse design) warrant ADRs |
| `ca-aia` | `ca-pia` | Personal-information feeding the algorithmic system inherits PIA controls; AIA depth must match PIA depth |

### 2026-05-23 - USA Federal Civilian Overlay Commands (Community)

Added 10 community-overlay commands (`us-*`) covering US federal civilian compliance instruments (FedRAMP authorization, FISMA / NIST 800-53 Rev 5, CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model, OMB M-19-17 ICAM, NIST AI RMF + OMB M-24-10/M-25-21 AI assurance, E-Government Act §208 PIA, EO 14028 SBOM self-attestation). They ship with the `[COMMUNITY]` description prefix and are not part of the officially-maintained baseline. Total command count moves to **135** (71 official + 64 community).

**Statutory currency anchor**: EO 14110 was revoked January 2025; the live AI mandates are OMB M-24-10 + M-25-21. FedRAMP completed the Rev 5 transition in 2024.

**Canonical execution chain (us-federal recipe, 5 waves)**:

```text
Wave 1 (baseline):    principles → requirements → us-fisma-categorization
Wave 2 (controls):    us-fisma-categorization → us-nist-800-53
Wave 3 (posture):     us-nist-800-53 → us-zero-trust → us-icam
Wave 4 (ai):          us-ai-rmf → us-ai-impact → us-privacy-pia
Wave 5 (authorization): us-sbom-eo-14028 → us-fedramp-ssp → us-fedramp-readiness
                      → adr → sobc → risk → framework
```

**Handoff matrix** (extracted from `plugins/arckit-us/commands/us-*.md` frontmatter):

| From command | Handoff target | Condition / rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `us-fisma-categorization` | `us-nist-800-53` | The FIPS 199 high-water mark drives the NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 baseline (Low / Moderate / High) for control tailoring |
| `us-fisma-categorization` | `us-privacy-pia` | Information types containing PII trigger an E-Government Act §208 PIA; the FIPS 199 inventory seeds the PIA personal-information register |
| `us-fisma-categorization` | `risk` | Categorization rationale and any ambiguous information-type mappings feed the project risk register |
| `us-nist-800-53` | `us-fedramp-ssp` | The tailored control set and implementation statements drop directly into the FedRAMP SSP control-implementation tables |
| `us-nist-800-53` | `us-zero-trust` | Control selections (especially AC, IA, SC families) feed the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model scoring |
| `us-nist-800-53` | `us-sbom-eo-14028` | Supply-chain controls (SR family) cross-reference the EO 14028 secure-software attestation and SBOM register |
| `us-nist-800-53` | `adr` | Significant tailoring decisions (compensating controls, control inheritance boundaries, parameter values) warrant ADRs |
| `us-fedramp-ssp` | `us-fedramp-readiness` | The SSP is the primary input to the 3PAO Readiness Assessment Report; gaps surfaced during SSP authoring populate the RAR gap register |
| `us-fedramp-ssp` | `us-zero-trust` | SSP control implementations seed the CISA Zero Trust Maturity scoring (Identity, Devices, Networks, Apps & Workloads, Data pillars) |
| `us-fedramp-ssp` | `us-icam` | The Types of Users section and IA-family control implementations connect to the ICAM architecture |
| `us-fedramp-readiness` | `service-assessment` | The readiness gap register feeds the broader service-assessment evidence pack |
| `us-fedramp-readiness` | `roadmap` | Remediation actions for FedRAMP gaps drop into the architecture roadmap timeline |
| `us-fedramp-readiness` | `risk` | Open gaps and POA&M items become entries in the project risk register |

| `us-zero-trust` | `us-nist-800-53` | Zero Trust controls map back to specific 800-53 controls (AC, IA, SC, SI families); deficient maturity stages flag controls for re-tailoring |
| `us-zero-trust` | `adr` | Architectural decisions to reach Advanced or Optimal maturity (e.g. micro-segmentation strategy, policy-decision-point selection) warrant ADRs |
| `us-icam` | `us-zero-trust` | ICAM is the foundation of the Zero Trust Identity pillar; IAL/AAL/FAL selections directly score ZTMM Identity functions |
| `us-icam` | `us-privacy-pia` | Identity proofing collects and processes PII (especially IAL2/IAL3); the ICAM data flows feed the PIA personal-information inventory |
| `us-icam` | `adr` | Identity provider selection (PIV vs login.gov vs agency-specific) and federation pattern decisions warrant ADRs |
| `us-ai-rmf` | `us-ai-impact` | Translate AI RMF findings into the M-24-10 rights-impacting / safety-impacting determination and the M-25-21 acquisition controls |
| `us-ai-rmf` | `us-privacy-pia` | AI systems trained on or inferencing over PII require an E-Gov Act §208 PIA; the AI RMF data inventory seeds the PIA |
| `us-ai-rmf` | `risk` | Residual AI risks (confabulation, bias, security, value-chain) flow into the project risk register |
| `us-ai-rmf` | `adr` | Model architecture, hosting, data-governance, and human-oversight decisions made during the RMF process warrant ADRs |
| `us-ai-impact` | `us-ai-rmf` | The minimum-practice gaps surfaced here drive the AI RMF Govern / Map / Measure / Manage uplift backlog |

| `us-ai-impact` | `risk` | Residual M-24-10 risks (especially where minimum practices cannot be met) flow into the risk register |
| `us-privacy-pia` | `us-icam` | PII collected by identity proofing (IAL2/IAL3) and authentication processes is documented in the PIA; the ICAM data flows must reconcile with the PIA inventory |
| `us-privacy-pia` | `us-ai-impact` | AI systems processing PII require both the PIA and the M-24-10 rights-impacting determination; the PIA feeds the AI Impact Assessment |
| `us-privacy-pia` | `data-model` | PII fields and lawful authorities surface as data-model attributes and access-control rules |
| `us-sbom-eo-14028` | `us-nist-800-53` | SR (Supply Chain Risk Management) and SA (System and Services Acquisition) control family implementations must cross-reference the attestation and SBOM |
| `us-sbom-eo-14028` | `adr` | SBOM format choice (CycloneDX vs SPDX), signing strategy (Sigstore, in-toto, SLSA level), and attestation exception requests warrant ADRs |
| `us-sbom-eo-14028` | `risk` | Components with known unmitigated vulnerabilities or attestation exceptions feed the risk register |
