# Invincat CLI Architecture Guide

This document is for code reading and extension work. It explains `invincat_cli` at three levels: the main runtime flow, package responsibilities, and module responsibilities. It is not a user manual; its goal is to help contributors quickly decide which package and file to inspect for a given capability.

## Main Runtime Flow

The main Invincat CLI flow can be read as:

1. `invincat_cli.__main__` / `invincat_cli.main` parses CLI arguments and enters the selected runtime mode.
2. `invincat_cli.cli` assembles CLI arguments, MCP settings, dependency checks, and Textual or non-interactive entry points.
3. `invincat_cli.app` creates the Textual application and combines mixins/handlers from `app_runtime`.
4. `invincat_cli.agent` creates the DeepAgents/LangGraph agent and injects tools, middleware, backend, and system prompt.
5. `invincat_cli.textual_adapter` converts agent streams, tool calls, interrupts, todos, and approval results into Textual UI messages.
6. `invincat_cli.widgets` renders TUI components such as chat messages, tool calls, approvals, status bars, and selectors.
7. Subsystems such as `invincat_cli.io`, `scheduler`, `memory`, `mcp`, `wecom`, and `skills` provide concrete capabilities.

The core `/plan` mode path is:

```text
command_handlers -> plan_handlers -> plan_mode.runtime/policy/handoff
                                      -> planner agent
                                      -> approve_plan
                                      -> main agent handoff
```
