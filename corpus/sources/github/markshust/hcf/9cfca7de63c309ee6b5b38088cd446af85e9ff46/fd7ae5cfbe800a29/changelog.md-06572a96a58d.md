## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.0] — 2026-08-25

### Changed
- **Session persistence now relies on Claude Code natively; the ralph-wiggum integration is removed.** Its rationale is obsolete — sessions no longer die at context limits, auto-compaction summarizes and continues — and the integration never worked as documented anyway: `plan-orchestrate` told Claude to invoke `/ralph-wiggum:loop`, but the plugin's actual command is `ralph-loop`, and both its commands are marked `hide-from-slash-command-tool`, so Claude could never invoke them itself in the first place.

  In its place, `plan-orchestrate` (Step 0) and `plan-create` (the "ready to begin?" prompt) surface a copy-pasteable tip for Claude Code's built-in `/goal` command — `/goal` is user-typed and cannot be started by a skill, so a tip is the honest integration. The suggested condition deliberately covers **both** terminal outputs, `ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE` and `TASKS_BLOCKED`, so a legitimately blocked run ends the goal instead of leaving its evaluator demanding progress that cannot happen.

  `project-setup` no longer prompts to install ralph-wiggum and no longer writes the `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md` gitignore entry; `project-update` no longer checks for it (a stale entry in an existing project is harmless and left alone). Plan and task file formats are unchanged, interrupted runs still resume from on-disk state, and anyone who prefers ralph-wiggum can still start it manually — the orchestrator's terminal outputs satisfy its completion promise exactly as before.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-08-17

### Added
- **Configurable plans directory** ([#1](https://github.com/markshust/hcf/pull/1), by [@michielgerritsen](https://github.com/michielgerritsen)). Plans live in `.claude/plans/` unless a project sets `plansDir` in an optional, user-owned `.claude/hcf.json`:

  ```json
  { "plansDir": "docs/plans" }
  ```

  No skill creates or modifies that file, `project-setup` never asks about it, and with it absent everything behaves exactly as before. `plansDir` must be relative to the project root; absolute paths and `..` segments are rejected. Changing it once plans exist means moving the folders yourself — HCF does not migrate them, and `project-update` warns when `.claude/plans` still holds plan folders after a move.

  Resolution is `hooks/resolve-plans-dir.sh`, built on 2.1.1's project anchor, so the answer does not depend on the working directory and the `.hook-fingerprint` written beside a plan follows `plansDir` with it. **A malformed value stops the run instead of falling back to the default** — quietly writing plans somewhere the project did not ask for is the failure mode this whole area keeps producing, and the resolver deliberately does not add another instance of it. No `jq` dependency, for the same reason: a missing `jq` would turn a configured `plansDir` into a silent default on Debian minimal and Alpine.

  Subagents stay configuration-unaware. `plan-orchestrate` passes each `tdd-worker` a concrete `## Task File Path`, `plan-create` passes post-plan agents a concrete `## Plan Directory`, and both agents are told never to read `hcf.json` — one resolver runs per skill, so there is no second resolver to drift from the first.

## [2.1.1] — 2026-08-17

A single bug fix, in the same place 2.1.0 fixed one: the enrollment a run is
built against must be the project's own, and must never be quietly substituted.

### Fixed
- **Project-local agents were invisible whenever the working directory was not the project root**, and nothing said so — [#4](https://github.com/markshust/hcf/issues/4)'s failure class, a silent false-empty enrollment, reached by a route 2.1.0 did not close. Discovery resolved the project as `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}` and then skipped a missing `.claude/agents` as the ordinary case it usually is. But `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is not exported to a skill's Bash calls, so in practice the anchor was `$PWD` alone — and the working directory persists across a session's Bash calls, so a single earlier `cd` was enough. Discovery then enumerated the plugin's agents only, and returned a perfectly well-formed answer.

  The visible damage came later. `plan-create` captures a fingerprint of the resolved enrollment and stores it with the plan; `plan-orchestrate` re-checks it at every hook. A fingerprint captured from the wrong directory records an enrollment the project never had, so the *next* run halts with `enrollment changed since this run started` and names a change nobody made. The documented remedy for that halt — delete the fingerprint and re-baseline — is also exactly what you would do to paper over a genuine enrollment change, so the guard trained you to ignore it.

  Resolution now walks up from the working directory to the nearest ancestor containing `.claude/`, falling back to the enclosing git repository root — a project that has not created `.claude/` yet is still a project, and `plan-create` has no prerequisite on `project-setup`, so it can legitimately be the first HCF command run in a fresh repo. Running from a subdirectory resolves identically to running from the root, and **when nothing yields a root the script aborts with exit 1** instead of assuming one. `$HOME` bounds both fallbacks, so neither `~/.claude` nor a dotfiles repo is mistaken for a project.

  `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` still wins when set, and is still not required to contain a `.claude/` directory — but is now checked to be a directory at all. Set to a stale path, it used to produce the same silently-wrong enumeration one level up.

### Added
- `hooks/resolve-project-dir.sh` — the single implementation of project-root resolution, runnable on its own (`resolve-project-dir.sh` prints the root it found) and sourceable by other scripts. Following `discover-hooks.sh`'s precedent: path resolution that several callers depend on belongs in a script you can run and test, not in a snippet each caller reinvents.
- 28 tests covering resolution, both `$HOME` boundaries, and the refusal (`./tests/run-tests.sh test-project-dir`). The previous suite always set `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, which is why the fallback beneath it went untested and the bug in it survived a release.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-26

Primarily a bug-fix release. The two additions exist because fixing the bug
properly required a discovery implementation you can actually run and inspect.

### Fixed
- **Hooks silently failing to run** ([#4](https://github.com/markshust/hcf/issues/4)). Hook discovery was described in `HOOKS.md` as prose steps for the model to follow, so every session improvised its own bash enumeration. One such script hit a parse error partway through (`for f in $LOC/*.md 2>/dev/null` — redirections aren't allowed in a `for` word list), its partial output was consumed as a complete enumeration, and **every hook resolved empty**. Nothing surfaced, because the empty-hook rule mandates silence — a crashed discovery and a legitimately empty one were indistinguishable. Discovery is now a shipped script (`hooks/discover-hooks.sh`) that both skills run at all 8 call sites.
- **The frontmatter example in our own docs didn't parse.** `HOOKS.md` and `README.md` both document enrollment with a trailing comment on every value (`phase: post-plan   # enrolls this agent…`). That form yielded an unknown phase and a non-numeric order, so anyone copy-pasting the documented example got an agent that never ran.
- **Agent files with CRLF line endings were silently skipped**, since `---\r` doesn't match the frontmatter delimiter.
- **The local-overrides-plugin merge now keys on the frontmatter `name`**, as `HOOKS.md` always specified, rather than on the filename.
- **A discovery failure can no longer be mistaken for an empty hook.** The empty-hook fast path is now defined as *exit 0 with empty stdout*; every other non-zero exit is an error reported loudly. `HOOKS.md`'s silent fallback to "local agents only" is also gone — quietly dropping the plugin's own bundled agents was itself a failure mode.

### Added
- **A command you can run yourself.** `$(claude plugin path hcf)/hooks/discover-hooks.sh` prints what is enrolled at every hook; `--hook=<name>` for one, `--json` for tooling. This is the fastest answer to "why didn't my agent fire?" — a question that previously had no answer at all, since the improvised script no longer existed by the time you asked.
- **Drift detection.** `--fingerprint` captures the resolved enrollment across all 8 hooks; `plan-create` stores it with the plan and `plan-orchestrate` re-checks it on every hook call. If agent files change midway through a run, HCF halts and names what changed rather than silently finishing against a different pipeline than the plan was reviewed against. Agent *body* content is deliberately not covered — editing an agent's prose is not drift.
- **Test suite** (`./tests/run-tests.sh`) — 97 tests, no dependencies beyond bash/awk/sed/sort/grep, runs on bash 3.2 (stock macOS).

### Changed
- **An invalid `phase` or `mode` now aborts (exit 3) instead of being warned past.** Previously an unknown `phase` was ignored with a warning, which meant the agent ran *nowhere* — the same silent non-execution as the bug above, one level down. Validation is global, so the error surfaces at the first hook of a run rather than hours later at commit time. **This can affect existing projects:** an agent file with a typo'd `phase` runs today (minus that agent) and will now halt planning until it is fixed. The error names the file, the bad value, and both remedies — correct the value, or remove the `phase` key entirely to unenroll the agent. Only `plan-create` and `plan-orchestrate` call the script; `/project-update` and every other skill stay runnable.
- `HOOKS.md`'s Discovery Routine now documents what the script does rather than instructing the reader to enumerate agent files by hand.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- **8 lifecycle hook points** spanning the plan and implementation flow: `pre-plan` / `post-plan`, `pre-implementation` / `post-implementation`, `pre-batch` / `post-batch`, and `pre-commit` / `post-commit`. Agents enroll at a hook to run at that named moment.
- **Agent-frontmatter pipeline fields** — agents declare their pipeline membership directly in YAML frontmatter: `phase` (the hook point to enroll at), `order` (run order within a hook; lower runs first, default `100`), and `mode` (`single` or `batch`, default `single`).
- **`HOOKS.md`** — a new top-level reference doc that is the authoritative source for the hook system: the 8 hook points, the frontmatter schema, the agent discovery routine, and sort/tie-break rules.
- **Migration hooks** (in `hooks/hooks.json`) — a `SessionStart` notice plus `PreToolUse` and `UserPromptExpansion` gates that detect a legacy `.claude/pipeline.md` and **block `plan-create`/`plan-orchestrate` until it is migrated** with `/project-update` (covering both Claude-invoked and directly-typed slash commands). `/project-update` itself is never blocked, so the fix is always available.
- **`Feature Development` section in the generated `CLAUDE.md`** — `project-setup` now emits a project-agnostic section, placed as the **first section** (right after the title/description), that routes feature work through `hcf:plan-create` / `hcf:plan-orchestrate` and tells Claude never to use the built-in plan mode. Previously the generated `CLAUDE.md` had no such wiring, so the planning workflow relied entirely on the skill's auto-trigger and could be suppressed by other directives in `CLAUDE.md`; the prominent placement is deliberate so it overrides them.

### Changed
- The pipeline is now configured via **agent frontmatter** (`phase:`) instead of a central `pipeline.md`. Declaring a `phase` on any agent enrolls it; because the bundled `devils-advocate` declares a `phase`, frontmatter enrollment is always authoritative.
- `plan-orchestrate` now reads each agent's `mode` field to decide how to spawn it (`single` vs `batch`) instead of inferring it from the agent body.
- `project-setup` no longer creates `pipeline.md`.
- `project-update` now **migrates** a legacy `pipeline.md` into agent frontmatter (and removes the file once migrated).
- `project-update` now **adds a missing Feature Development section** to `CLAUDE.md` automatically (purely additive — it never touches an existing section). This carries the `plan-create` / `plan-orchestrate` wiring across an upgrade for projects set up before the section existed.
- The **empty-hook fast path** now explicitly forbids *narrating* why a hook is empty, not just suppressing the resolved-order line. An empty hook is silent and internal — `plan-orchestrate` no longer "thinks out loud" about agent enrollment (e.g. "tdd-worker and standards-enforcer declare no phase → no-op") during a run. Documented in `HOOKS.md` and `plan-orchestrate`.
- `project-setup` and `project-update` are now **command-only** (`disable-model-invocation: true`) — they cannot be invoked programmatically by another skill.

### Removed
- `pipeline.md` is **no longer read as configuration** — there is no runtime fallback. HCF enrolls agents exclusively via frontmatter. A leftover `.claude/pipeline.md` blocks the planning workflow until `/project-update` migrates it into agent frontmatter and removes the file.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-05-01

### Changed
- `standards-enforcer` is now commented out by default in the `post-implementation` pipeline. The agent uses substantial tokens and isn't mission-critical for most users; uncomment in `.claude/pipeline.md` to re-enable code-standards enforcement on changed files before commit.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-01

### Added
- **Phase 1: Discovery & Assumption Brainstorm** in `plan-create` — solution-architect-style codebase exploration and permutation enumeration before clarifying questions are asked.
- **Phase 2: Grounded Clarification** — questions are now categorized as *must-answer* (decisions that shape scope/data model/architecture) versus *will-default-if-silent* (with proposed defaults stated).
- **Discovery Notes** section in the `_plan.md` template, capturing Phase 1 findings for resumed sessions and future readers.
- Expanded auto-trigger patterns in `plan-create`'s description: aspirational openers ("let's build", "I want an app that"), capability lists ("users should be able to X, Y, Z"), and vague-noun patterns ("a system for", "a way to").
- **Release Process** section in `CLAUDE.md` documenting the `hcf--v{version}` tag convention.

### Changed
- `plan-create` renumbered to 8 phases (Discovery is now Phase 1, Grounded Clarification is Phase 2; the former Phase 1 ("Initial Clarification") was replaced by the grounded version).
- README updated to reflect the new Discovery & Brainstorm step and the must-answer / will-default-if-silent question categorization.

### Removed
- `project-overview.md` is no longer generated by `project-setup` or audited by `project-update`. The default-template content was already mirrored in `CLAUDE.md`, and richer expansions tended to drift out of date relative to the codebase. Existing user files are left untouched but are no longer part of the HCF workflow.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-27

Initial public release.

### Added
- Plugin scaffolding via `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (same-repo marketplace for GitHub-based install).
- **Skills**: `project-setup` (one-time project configuration with stack auto-detection), `project-update` (sync project config with plugin defaults), `plan-create` (interactive planning with auto-trigger on feature requests), `plan-orchestrate` (parallel TDD execution with auto-trigger on execution requests).
- **Agents**: `tdd-worker` (strict Red → Green → Refactor implementation), `devils-advocate` (post-plan review for gaps and integration completeness), `standards-enforcer` (post-implementation code-standards enforcement).
- **Configurable pipeline** — `pipeline.md` controls which agents run in `post-plan` and `post-implementation` phases; supports custom agents via `.claude/agents/`.
- **Feature branch workflow** — plans automatically work on `feature/{plan-name}` branches; orchestrator verifies branch before execution.
- **Dependency graph + parallel batch execution** — tasks declare dependencies, orchestrator runs independent tasks in parallel batches.
- **Single-commit release pattern** — plan status, implementation, and pipeline fixes commit together after the full test suite passes.
- **ralph-wiggum integration** — orchestrator wraps execution with `/ralph-wiggum:loop` for session persistence on large plans.
- **GitHub issue linking** — `plan-create` captures issue references (`Closes #N`, `Relates to #N`) and `plan-orchestrate` includes them in PR bodies for auto-close on merge.
