# Architecture

amux is a terminal UI (Bubble Tea v2) for running and orchestrating coding
agents. Each agent runs in its own tmux session hosted in a pseudo-terminal;
amux parses that terminal output with a built-in emulator, composes it with the
surrounding UI, and renders the result. Two binaries share the `internal`
packages: `cmd/amux` (the interactive app) and `cmd/amux-harness` (a headless
renderer used for deterministic perf and render testing).

For the runtime detail of the app package — lifecycle, PTY flow, tmux activity
tagging, and persistence invariants — see
[internal/app/ARCHITECTURE.md](internal/app/ARCHITECTURE.md). For the message
boundaries and command discipline between the app pump and the panes, see
[internal/app/MESSAGE_FLOW.md](internal/app/MESSAGE_FLOW.md). For the
streaming/scrolling model — flush pipeline, DEC 2026 frame atomicity, viewport
anchoring, and drag auto-scroll — see
[internal/ui/center/SCROLLING.md](internal/ui/center/SCROLLING.md).

## Dependency direction

Dependencies point downward. Most UI code reaches OS and process boundaries
through the tmux/pty/git/data layers. UI packages may still own
interaction-local adapters when the behavior is part of a widget boundary, such
as clipboard writes and file-picker filesystem reads in `internal/ui/common`,
per-tab PTY tracing in `internal/ui/center`, and shell plumbing in the sidebar
terminal. Shared process, persistence, git, tmux, and PTY behavior — including the
shared PTY/tmux read-loop and session plumbing in `internal/ui/ptyio` — belongs in
the lower layers.

```
            cmd/amux            cmd/amux-harness
                \                   /
                 v                 v
              internal/app  (message pump, services, tmux-activity lease)
                 |  \
                 |   `-- internal/ui/{dashboard, center, sidebar, diff}
                 |              |
                 |              v
                 |       internal/ui/{compositor, layout, common, ptyio, theme}
                 v              |
   internal/{tmux, pty, git,    v
     data, update, config,  internal/vterm   (terminal emulator)
     supervisor, process}
                 \              /
                  v            v
        internal/{safego, perf, logging, messages, validation}
```

### External render-engine coupling

`internal/ui/compositor` imports `github.com/charmbracelet/ultraviolet`
directly on the core render path (`vtermlayer.go`, `pool.go`,
`canvas_drawable.go`). ultraviolet has no semver releases; its go.mod
pseudo-version is whatever `charm.land/bubbletea/v2` requires (MVS picks
bubbletea's pin). Keep the pin in lockstep with bubbletea: upgrade bubbletea
and let `go mod tidy` pull the matching ultraviolet — never bump ultraviolet
on its own, because a mismatched pair can break rendering with no compiler
warning.
