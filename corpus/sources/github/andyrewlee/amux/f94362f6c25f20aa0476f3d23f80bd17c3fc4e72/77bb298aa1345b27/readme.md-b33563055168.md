## What is amux?

amux is a terminal UI for running multiple coding agents in parallel with a workspace-first model that can import git worktrees.

## Prerequisites

amux requires [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (minimum 3.2). Each agent runs in its own tmux session for terminal isolation and persistence.

## Quick start

```bash
brew tap andyrewlee/amux
brew install amux
```

Or via the install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andyrewlee/amux/main/install.sh | sh
```

Or with Go (requires Go 1.26 or newer; contributors should use the patched
toolchain pinned in `go.mod`):

```bash
go install github.com/andyrewlee/amux/cmd/amux@latest
```

Then run `amux` to open the dashboard.

## How it works

Each workspace tracks a repo checkout and its metadata. For local workflows, workspaces are typically backed by git worktrees on their own branches so agents work in isolation and you can merge changes back when done.

Both write actions are available from the UI, each behind an explicit confirmation:

- **Commit** — press `c` in the Changes sidebar to stage everything in the workspace and commit it with a message you type. The commit lands on the workspace's own branch; amux never pushes.
- **Merge** — press `M` on a workspace row in the dashboard to merge its branch into its base with `git merge --no-ff`. The merge happens in the project's primary checkout, so amux first checks that the base branch is already checked out there and refuses otherwise rather than moving your HEAD. On a conflict it lists the conflicted files and offers to abort; resolving them is yours to do in the terminal.

Note that amux runs git with repository hooks disabled (see `AMUX_ALLOW_GIT_HOOKS` below), so your own `pre-commit` or `pre-merge` hooks will not fire on these actions.

## Architecture quick tour

Start with [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the repo-level package map and dependency direction. Then `internal/app/ARCHITECTURE.md` covers lifecycle, PTY flow, tmux tagging, and persistence invariants, and `internal/app/MESSAGE_FLOW.md` documents message boundaries and command discipline.

External orchestration: the supported tmux-level contract is documented in [docs/ORCHESTRATION.md](docs/ORCHESTRATION.md).

## Features

- **Parallel agents**: Launch multiple agents within main repo and within workspaces
- **No wrappers**: Works with Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Droid, Cursor, Pi, Oh My Pi, Antigravity, FX, Grok, Amp, and Cline
- **Keyboard + mouse**: Can be operated with just the keyboard or with a mouse
- **All-in-one tool**: Run agents, view diffs, and access terminal

## Configuration

Create `.amux/workspaces.json` in your project to define commands that amux runs for its workspaces:

```json
{
  "setup-workspace": [
    "npm install",
    "cp $ROOT_WORKSPACE_PATH/.env.local .env.local"
  ],
  "run": "npm start",
  "archive": "tar -czf archive.tar.gz ."
}
```

- `setup-workspace` — commands run once when a new workspace is created.
- `run` — the command started for a workspace's run script. Press `r` in the
  Changes sidebar to start it, and `r` again to stop it; a `[run]` marker sits
  next to the branch name while it is live. Bind your dev server to `AMUX_PORT`
  so parallel workspaces don't collide.
- `archive` — the command run when a workspace is archived, i.e. just before its
  worktree is deleted. It runs to completion (up to two minutes) in the worktree
  while that directory still exists, after the run script has been stopped. It
  is best-effort: if it fails or the repo isn't trusted yet, amux warns you and
  deletes the workspace anyway, so a broken archive script can never strand a
  workspace. Write it to tolerate running twice — if the delete itself fails
  after the script has run, retrying the delete runs it again.

### Environment available to workspace scripts

`setup-workspace`, `run`, and `archive` scripts run with these variables set, in addition to your normal shell environment:

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `AMUX_WORKSPACE_NAME` | The workspace name |
| `AMUX_WORKSPACE_ROOT` | The workspace worktree path |
| `AMUX_WORKSPACE_BRANCH` | The workspace's git branch |
| `ROOT_WORKSPACE_PATH` | The source repository root (also shown in the example above) |
| `AMUX_PORT` | An allocated per-workspace port — bind dev servers here to avoid collisions across parallel workspaces |
| `AMUX_PORT_RANGE` | The `start-end` port range allocated to this workspace |

Because these commands come from the repository, amux runs them only after you trust the repo. The first time a repo's `.amux/workspaces.json` would run (and every time its contents change), amux records the approved content of the file; until then those project-supplied scripts are skipped and you are notified, rather than executing arbitrary commands chosen by the repo's author. Editing `.amux/workspaces.json` invalidates the approval, so changed commands are re-gated until you trust the file again. (Run/archive scripts you enter yourself in the amux UI are your own input and are never gated.)

Workspace metadata is stored in `~/.amux/workspaces-metadata/<workspace-id>/workspace.json`, and local worktree directories live under `~/.amux/workspaces/<project>/<workspace>`. Trusted-repo approvals are recorded in `~/.amux/trusted-scripts.json`.

Assistants: the AI agents amux can launch are configured per-user in `~/.amux/config.json`. You can add your own or override a built-in — see [docs/CONFIG.md](docs/CONFIG.md).

## Platform Support

AMUX requires `tmux` and is supported on Linux/macOS. Windows is not supported.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andyrewlee/amux.git
cd amux
./scripts/install-hooks.sh   # one-time: enables the pre-commit + pre-push git hooks
make lint-tools              # one-time: builds the pinned golangci-lint into ./.cache/bin
make run
```

Run `./scripts/install-hooks.sh` once after cloning. It points `core.hooksPath`
at `.githooks`, enabling the pre-commit fmt/lint/file-length checks and the
pre-push lint-parity gate the project relies on for quality.

Run `make lint-tools` once before your first `make devcheck` or `git commit`.
It builds the linter pinned in `.golangci-version` into the gitignored
`./.cache/bin`; a stock `golangci-lint` from `PATH` may be a different version
from CI and produce different diagnostics. See [LINTING.md](LINTING.md) and
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Operations

- Logs are written to `~/.amux/logs/amux-YYYY-MM-DD.log` (default retention 14 days). Override retention with `AMUX_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`.
- Log verbosity: set `AMUX_LOG_LEVEL=debug` (accepts `debug`/`info`/`warn`/`error`; default `info`) to change what gets written to the log — `debug` is the first thing to try when reporting or diagnosing a problem.
- Attached-tab limit: set `AMUX_MAX_ATTACHED_AGENT_TABS` (default 6; `0` disables the limit) to change how many agent tabs keep live PTYs attached concurrently.
- Terminal-tab limit: set `AMUX_MAX_ATTACHED_TERMINAL_TABS` (default 6; `0` disables the limit) to change how many sidebar terminals keep live PTYs attached; least-recently-used background terminals detach automatically, stay alive in tmux, and re-attach when their workspace is selected.
- Git hooks: amux runs git with repo hooks and `core.fsmonitor` disabled so a checked-out repository cannot execute code just because amux touched it; set `AMUX_ALLOW_GIT_HOOKS=1` if your workflow needs repo hooks to run. git-lfs works either way — its clean/smudge filters are never disabled, and amux points `core.hooksPath` at `/dev/null` (not at an empty value) so lfs cannot leave stray hook files in a workspace root.
- OSC 52 clipboard: set `AMUX_ENABLE_OSC52_CLIPBOARD=1` to let agent terminal output copy to your clipboard via OSC 52 (off by default because terminal output is untrusted; payloads over 64 KiB are ignored).
- Perf profiling: set `AMUX_PROFILE=1` to emit periodic timing/counter snapshots; adjust cadence with `AMUX_PROFILE_INTERVAL_MS` (default 5000).
- pprof: set `AMUX_PPROF=1` (or a port like `6061`) to expose `net/http/pprof` on `127.0.0.1`.
- Debug signals: set `AMUX_DEBUG_SIGNALS=1` and send `SIGUSR1` to dump goroutines into the log.
- PTY tracing: set `AMUX_PTY_TRACE=1` or a comma-separated assistant list; traces write to the log dir (or OS temp dir if logging is disabled). The trace captures both directions of the pipeline — agent→amux output is tagged `RECV` and amux→agent input (keystrokes, pastes, the delayed Enter/CR) is tagged `SEND` — so send-path issues like a dropped Enter can be debugged at the byte level.
