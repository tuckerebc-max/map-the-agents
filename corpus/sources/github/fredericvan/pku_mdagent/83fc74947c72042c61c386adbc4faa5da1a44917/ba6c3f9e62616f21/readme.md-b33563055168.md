Comparison of thermodynamic analysis workflow with and without the use of Molecular Dynamics Agent (MDAgent). In the process on the left, the manual workflow requires human users to perform every step, resulting in inefficiency, complexity, and high skill requirements. In contrast, in the MDAgent-assisted workflow on the right, the agent automates key tasks in LAMMPS and other software, enabling a semi-automated, efficient process. The agent simplifies user tasks, reduces the skill requirement, and minimizes errors by overseeing each step and assisting the user as needed.

## Methods for integrating domain knowledge into LLM

    There are three main mainstream schemes for incorporating domain knowledge into Large Language Model (LLM) working agents: pre-training, fine-tuning, and retrieval-enhanced generation (RAG). While pre-training can radically enhance the knowledge base of the model, the amount of data and computational cost required is too large to be practical for this study. Fine-tuning is our preferred option as it can directly and effectively enhance the LLM's expertise and knowledge in a specific domain.RAG is not effective for the problems of this project and serves as our alternative as well as optional option.

![image-20250215231639090](assets/image-20250215231639090.png)

### Method1.fine-tuning

    The mainstream unsloth framework (https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) is used in this study to fine-tune the macromodel.
    
    We provide an example file in the . /fine-tuning folder to provide an example file running on the colab with google drive platform for fine-tuning Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as LammpsWorkerLLM.

![image-20250215225737037](assets/image-20250215225737037.png)

    Some parameters and suitable hyperparameters are specified before our fine-tuning work, such as quantisation: 4-bit quantisation (QLoRA), context length: 4096 tokens, parameter size: 8B parameter count. The fine-tuned data template is used alpaca_prompt, which contains three fields: instruction, input, and response. We also used dynamic evaluation to continue training if the loss threshold is not reached.

### Method2.RAG

#### Why RAG can only be used as an alternative

    With respect to the LAMMPS code generation and evaluation capabilities explored in this study, we found that the RAG technique has some limitations in directly enhancing large model domain knowledge capabilities. Specifically, since RAG is primarily adept at retrieving relevant information or contextual knowledge from knowledge bases, while it can provide snippets of LAMMPS documentation or examples before each answer, the retrieved content is not always guaranteed to be sufficient, and RAG does not allow LLMs to acquire the deep syntactic understanding at the parameter level required to generate fully valid and executable LAMMPS code. On the other hand, fine-tuning directly exposes LLM to a large number of correct LAMMPS code examples. Through this process, the larger model learns the complex syntax specific to LAMMPS. The result is that the effect is not as direct and efficient as fine-tuning the model parameters directly.
    
    For Example, Imagine asking for LAMMPS code to simulate a simple Lennard-Jones fluid. RAG might retrieve documentation explaining Lennard-Jones potentials or example scripts that are*similar* but not exactly what's needed.  The LLM still needs to *synthesize* valid code from these pieces. Fine-tuning, however, trains the model to directly *generate* the correct sequence of LAMMPS commands.
    
    Nonetheless, we believe that the RAG technique has significant value as a generic knowledge integration programme. On the one hand, even after fine-tuning the LLM, it may happen that the worker cannot easily solve some problems. At this point the MDAgent is allowed to try to acquire knowledge to help before answering by calling the RAG, or other Tools. On the other hand, considering other problems that the MDAgent faces in the future, the scenario may not be able to find a suitable fine-tuning dataset to fine-tune, which can only be solved by using the RAG and the TOOLS as alternatives.
    
    Therefore, in this study, while we take fine-tuning as the main research direction, we also provide RAG as an alternative, and keep the interface of RAG in the project code for further exploring and expanding its application potential in the future, as well as providing technical reserves for more general scenarios.

#### RAG's technology

Quoting Tongji-KGLLM/RAG-Survey on RAG technology（https://github.com/Tongji-KGLLM/RAG-Survey):

> In the technological development of RAG, we summarize its evolution from the perspective of technological paradigms into the following stages:
>
> **Naive RAG**
>
> The classic RAG process, also known as Naive RAG, is demonstrated in the previous example. It mainly includes three basic steps:
>
> 1. **Indexing** -Splitting the document corpus into shorter chunks and building a vector index through an encoder.
> 2. **Retrieval** - Retrieving relevant document fragments based on the similarity between the question and the chunks.
> 3. **Generation** - Generating an answer to the question conditioned on the retrieved context.
>
> **Advanced RAG**
>
> Naive RAG faces multiple challenges in retrieval, generation and augmentation. The Advanced RAG paradigm was subsequently proposed and involves additional processing in **Pre-Retrieval** and **Post-Retrieval**. Before retrieval, methods such as **query rewriting, routing, and expansion** can be used to align the semantic differences between questions and document chunks. After retrieval, **rerank** the retrieved document corpus can avoid the "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon, or the context can be filtered and **compressed** to shorten the window length.
>
> **Modular RAG**
>
> With the further development and evolution of RAG technology, new breakthroughs have transcended the traditional Naive RAG **Retrieval-Generation framework**, leading to the concept of Modular RAG. Structurally, it is more free and flexible, introducing more specific functional modules, such as query search engines and the fusion of multiple answers. Technologically, it integrates retrieval with fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and other techniques. In terms of process, the RAG modules are designed and orchestrated, resulting in various RAG patterns.
>
> However, Modular RAG did not emerge suddenly; there is a relationship of inheritance and development among the three paradigms. Advanced RAG is a special case of Modular RAG, while Naive RAG is a special case of Advanced RAG.

![RAG_Compare.png](https://github.com/Tongji-KGLLM/RAG-Survey/blob/main/images/Survey/RAG_Compare.png?raw=true)

The design of RAG interface technology reserved in this project work:

In the preprocessing work, the open source embedding model is used to vectorise the data and slice it according to the number of tokens, and then the LLM is used to automatically annotate the Keywords (Automatically extract N keywords for each chunk to increase their ranking for queries containing those keywords.).

In the retrieval work, a hybrid search based on vector search (BM25) and keyword search is used, and after obtaining the first round of chunk results, Rerank is performed using the open-source ReRank macromodel.

#### RAG implementation

    In this project implement the complete process of RAG based on the open source RagFlow framework (https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow). After the local deployment of RagFlow, the data is parsed and stored into the vector database through the visual interface, the knowledge base dataset is configured, then the RAG parameters are configured, and finally the RAG retrieval interface is exposed through the HTTP API and encapsulated as a Tool to be provided to the Agent for use.

## MDAgent implementation Details

This project is a multi-agent collaborative system developed on the basis of the AutoGen framework (https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), dedicated to simulation and analysis tasks in the field of materials science.

### LLMs in experiments

    In the experiments presented in the paper, the different Agent roles (such as Worker, Evaluator, etc.) in the MDAgent for each experiment are all based on the same LLM. Three primary base local LLMs we used were llama3.1 8B, llama3.1 8B-Instruct, and Gemma2 9B. In our practical work and exploration, we also used online large models without fine-tuning, such as gpt4o-mini and qwen-plus. Although these types of online large models have advantages in model scale, they cannot be deployed locally.

### Core Agents

1. **User Proxy Agent**
   - Inherits from MyConversableAgent
   - Primary interface for user interaction
   - Manages UI communication and task initialization
   - Handles input validation and output formatting
2. **Planner Agent**
   - Analyzes tasks and breaks them down into subtasks
   - Assigns appropriate agents to handle each subtask
3. **LAMMPS Worker Agent**
   - Expert in generating LAMMPS script files
   - Creates simulation scripts for materials science calculations
4. **LAMMPS Evaluator Agent**
   - Expert in evaluating LAMMPS scripts
   - Ensures scripts meet quality standards and requirements
5. **Manager (GroupChatManager)**
   - Coordinates communication between all agents
   - Manages the overall workflow and task completion
   - Ensures proper sequencing of agent interactions
   - Handles task transitions and agent selection

### Workflow Process

1. User submits a task to the system
2. **Planning Phase**

   - Planner analyzes the task
   - Breaks down into subtasks
   - Assigns appropriate agents
3. **Script Generation Phase**

   - LammpsWorker creates required scripts
   - Scripts are tailored to task requirements
4. **Evaluation Phase**

   - LammpsEvaluator reviews scripts
   - Provides score and feedback
   - If score < 8, returns to Script Generation Phase
   - If score ≥ 8, proceeds to next phase
5. **Management & Coordination**

   - Manager oversees the entire process
   - Ensures proper agent communication
   - Handles transitions between phases
   - Validates task completion
   - Returns final results to user
6. Process continues until task is completed successfully

### Important internal design

    Like all methods based on LLMs, MDAgent also struggles to completely avoid issues such as hallucinations, inability to answer successfully in one go, and factual errors. For these common problems, we have not yet found perfect solutions in current scientific research papers. To minimize the occurrence of these potential errors as much as possible, this paper adopts the Actor-Critic model and human-in-the-loop.
    
    Actor-Critic Model (Worker and Evaluator): After the Worker generates LAMMPS code, the Evaluator will conduct checks and evaluations. The evaluation content includes the detection of the aforementioned error types. For example, the Evaluator will check whether there are misspelled commands in the code (hallucination errors) or whether the physical parameters conform to common sense (factual errors). If the Evaluator's assessment is unqualified, the evaluation results will be fed back to the Worker, and the Worker will reflect and correct based on the feedback and regenerate the code.
    
    Human in Loop: During the Actor-Critic iterative loop, we allow human users to observe every input and output of the Agent. When users find errors (for example, if a user finds that MDAgent used the wrong lattice constant), they can directly intervene and provide corrective guidance. For example, users can directly inform the Agent of the correct lattice constant.
    
    Also, we have added emphasis in the original article that our domain experts have discussed and summarised several types of errors that are common in the code generated by LammpsWorkerLLM. Based on these error types summarised by the experts, we augmented LammpsEvaluator with prompt.

### Tool Integration

#### Code Executors（Docker Engine）

The code executor in this project is based on the Code Executors module provided by AutoGen.

![image-20250216133526766](assets/image-20250216133526766.png)

> In AutoGen, a code executor is a component that takes input messages (e.g., those containing code blocks), performs execution, and outputs messages with the results. AutoGen provides two types of built-in code executors, one is command line code executor, which runs code in a command line environment such as a UNIX shell, and the other is Jupyter executor, which runs code in an interactive[Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).

![Code Executor Docker](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/assets/images/code-executor-docker-8d3f56a6bb4b4605fec68804350f42fc.png)

    In this study we have chosen to use Docker Container as a platform for running the code. the docker executor extracts code blocks from input messages, writes them to code files. For each code file, it starts a docker container to execute the code file, and reads the console output of the code execution.
    
    In order to increase the accuracy rate, there is a Code Writer Agent in addition to the Code Executor Agent. In AutoGen, coding can be a conversation between a code writer agent and a code executor agent, mirroring the interaction between a programmer and a code interpreter.

![Code Writer and Code Executor](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/assets/images/code-execution-in-conversation-f02c7a3ea7e45e3f4aa71d8def851677.png)

#### RAG Tools

    In this project, we encapsulate the previous RAG API into Tool according to AutoGen's syntax, and provide it to Worker to call, so as to give the Agent the ability to use Tool. For details, please refer to the Tool code of this project and the official documentation of AutoGen.

### CodeWriter

```
You are a helpful AI assistant.
Solve tasks using your coding and language skills.
In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.
1. When you need to collect info, use the code to output the info you need, for example, browse or search the web, download/read a file, print the content of a webpage or a file, get the current date/time, check the operating system. After sufficient info is printed and the task is ready to be solved based on your language skill, you can solve the task by yourself.
2. When you need to perform some task with code, use the code to perform the task and output the result. Finish the task smartly.
Solve the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. Be clear which step uses code, and which step uses your language skill.
When using code, you must indicate the script type in the code block. The user cannot provide any other feedback or perform any other action beyond executing the code you suggest. The user can't modify your code. So do not suggest incomplete code which requires users to modify. Don't use a code block if it's not intended to be executed by the user.
If you want the user to save the code in a file before executing it, put # filename: <filename> inside the code block as the first line. Don't include multiple code blocks in one response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant. Check the execution result returned by the user.
If the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the full code instead of partial code or code changes. If the error can't be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.
When you find an answer, verify the answer carefully. Include verifiable evidence in your response if possible.
Reply 'TERMINATE' in the end when everything is done.
