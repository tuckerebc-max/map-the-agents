## Why VibeAround

VibeAround keeps AI coding work together without making you rebuild the environment you already have.

- Work with the coding agents you already use, including Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Pi, OpenCode, Claude Desktop, Codex Desktop, and more.
- Launch agents directly or through third-party AI APIs, without hand-editing each agent's config files back and forth.
- Bridge different AI API protocols so agents and model providers can work together even when their native APIs do not match.
- Continue the same sessions across desktop, CLI, messaging apps, mobile browsers, web browsers, and a Web Terminal.
- Preview dev servers, HTML, and rendered Markdown locally or through time-scoped remote links while execution stays on your own computer.
- Provide host-side tools like web search when the selected model provider does not offer them natively.
- Add these capabilities around your existing configs, project permissions, and workflows while keeping them as untouched as possible.

## Agent Launch

Launch the right agent with the right model.

Pick an AI agent, model profile or API endpoint, and workspace. VibeAround launches Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Pi, OpenCode, Claude Desktop, Codex Desktop and more with third-party AI APIs.

- Launch AI coding agents and desktop apps like Claude and Codex from one desktop UI.
- Choose agent, model profile, API endpoint, workspace, terminal, and session before launch.
- Start new sessions or continue previous sessions.
- Use direct launch or profile-based launch, including profile overlays for Claude Desktop and Codex Desktop.
- Record and inspect launch-scoped API traffic, including original request, bridge request, raw response, bridge response, and search tool contents.
- Refresh VibeAround-reserved project skills and the VibeAround MCP entry before launch without replacing unrelated agent configuration.

</details>

## Known Issue

### Why do I see `Unable to connect to API (ConnectionRefused)`?

This usually means the agent is still reading API settings written by CC Switch or another config-switching tool. Those settings can point the agent to a local proxy that is no longer running, so the agent refuses the connection before VibeAround can route the request.

Remove the conflicting fields from the corresponding agent config file, then launch the agent again from VibeAround. For Claude Code, check `~/.claude/settings.json` and remove stale provider fields such as an `env` block that sets a base URL, API key, or proxy endpoint. If you also have project-level Claude config files, check those as well.

## API Profiles & Bridge

Use more model providers with the AI agents you prefer. Save provider keys, base URLs, models, and aliases as profiles; when an agent and a provider speak different API shapes, VibeAround's local bridge translates between them.

```text
Agent-facing API shapes             VibeAround API Bridge               Provider API shapes
+-------------------------+         +-----------------------------+      +-------------------------+
| OpenAI Responses        | ----\   | profile-scoped local routes |  /-> | OpenAI Responses        |
| OpenAI Chat Completions | -----\  | model aliases and metadata  | /--> | OpenAI Chat Completions |
| Anthropic Messages      | ------> | request/response translate  | ---> | Anthropic Messages      |
| Gemini Generate Content | -----/  | va-ai-api-bridge (VAAAB)    | \--> | Gemini Generate Content |
+-------------------------+         +-----------------------------+      +-------------------------+
```

The bridge is powered by [va-ai-api-bridge](https://github.com/jazzenchen/va-ai-api-bridge), the standalone VAAAB project behind VibeAround's API translation.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://pub-806a1b8456464ce7a6c110f84946697e.r2.dev/documents/v0.7.7/readme/api-bridge.webp" alt="VibeAround API Bridge connection settings" width="88%" />
</p>

| API shape | Common endpoint |
|---|---|
| OpenAI Responses | `/v1/responses` |
| OpenAI Chat Completions | `/v1/chat/completions` |
| Anthropic Messages | `/v1/messages` |
| Gemini Generate Content | `/v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent` |

Built-in provider presets include DeepSeek, Alibaba DashScope, Moonshot / Kimi, MiniMax, Xiaomi MiMo, xAI / Grok, NVIDIA NIM, Z.AI / GLM, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, Azure OpenAI, and custom endpoints.

- Save API settings with keys, base URLs, models, aliases, and metadata.
- Bridge OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, and Gemini Generate Content shapes.
- Run the same AI agent with different API profiles across sessions.

## Host-side Web Search

Give agents web search even when the selected model provider does not expose native server-side search.

VibeAround can replace provider-native `web_search` with a local search runtime, then feed normalized results back into the model through the bridge. Search sources are configured in Settings and run through the [va-search-tool](https://github.com/jazzenchen/va-search-tool) project. The same search SDK/runtime can also run standalone from the command line for local smoke tests or custom integrations.

### va-search-tool

[va-search-tool](https://github.com/jazzenchen/va-search-tool) is the standalone search runtime behind VibeAround host-side web search. It can run as a supervised VibeAround plugin over stdio, as a CLI for one-off searches, or as a small local HTTP service with `/v1/search`. It currently supports Exa, Tavily, Grok / xAI, and Brave Search.

- Use Exa, Tavily, Grok / xAI, and Brave Search as host-side sources.
- Run standalone CLI checks with [`va-search-tool`](https://github.com/jazzenchen/va-search-tool) `search ...` or expose a local `/v1/search` service when you want the search runtime outside VibeAround.
- Test search settings before saving from the Web Search settings page.
- Inspect search requests and source-separated results in the Bridge recorder.
- Keep API keys in local settings while the AI provider only receives normalized search results.

## Agent as API

Use local AI coding agents as API endpoints for development and local testing.

VibeAround can expose enabled local agents as OpenAI / Anthropic-compatible APIs, so you can test app integrations against Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and other local agents without deploying a production gateway.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://pub-806a1b8456464ce7a6c110f84946697e.r2.dev/documents/v0.7.7/readme/agent-as-api.webp" alt="VibeAround Local API Workbench for testing coding agents as APIs" width="88%" />
</p>

| API shape | Local agent endpoint |
|---|---|
| OpenAI Responses | `/local-agent/{agent_id}/{profile_id}/v1/responses` |
| OpenAI Chat Completions | `/local-agent/{agent_id}/{profile_id}/v1/chat/completions` |
| Anthropic Messages | `/local-agent/{agent_id}/{profile_id}/v1/messages` |
| Models | `/local-agent/{agent_id}/{profile_id}/v1/models` |

- Test local agents from the Local API Workbench before wiring them into your app.
- Select the agent and profile through VibeAround, then call the matching local endpoint.
- Pass `x-vibearound-cwd` to run the request in a specific workspace directory.
- Use streaming or non-streaming requests with the supported API shapes.
- Keep this for dev and local test usage; VibeAround is not trying to be a hosted production API gateway.

## Remote Messaging & Session Continuity

Hand over a running coding session, then pick it up from anywhere.

VibeAround can prepare a `/pickup` command for the current desktop or CLI session. Paste that command into any connected IM channel to continue the same session with the same agent; the pickup is not tied to the channel where it was created.

IM integrations are built through the [VibeAround Channel SDK](https://github.com/jazzenchen/va-plugin-channel-sdk) and plugin system, so each messaging platform can run as a managed plugin around the same session and command model instead of being hard-coded into the core app.

### VibeAround Channel SDK

[VibeAround Channel SDK](https://github.com/jazzenchen/va-plugin-channel-sdk) is the SDK for building IM channel plugins. It handles the VibeAround agent/session lifecycle and command bridge, while each plugin focuses on the platform-specific transport and rendering, such as Feishu/Lark, Telegram, Slack, Discord, DingTalk, WeCom, or QQ Bot.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://pub-806a1b8456464ce7a6c110f84946697e.r2.dev/documents/v0.7.7/readme/im-remote.webp" alt="VibeAround Remote Access settings for messaging apps and Cloudflare tunnel" width="88%" />
</p>

- Hand over the current session from desktop, CLI, or Web Hub.
- Pick it up from Feishu/Lark, Discord, Slack, or another configured messaging channel.
- Add or update messaging channels through SDK-based plugins.
- Continue the same agent session remotely without losing context.
- Chat directly with AI agents from messaging apps after pickup.
- Switch workspaces and agents with `/switch`.
- Open preview links from the same conversation.

</details>

## Web Terminal

Control local AI agents from desktop or mobile browsers.

VibeAround exposes local terminal sessions through the web dashboard so you can drive AI agent CLIs from desktop or mobile browsers while execution stays on your computer.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://pub-806a1b8456464ce7a6c110f84946697e.r2.dev/documents/v0.7.12/readme/web-terminal.webp" alt="VibeAround Web Terminal for remote agent control" width="88%" />
</p>

- Access local AI agent CLIs through Web Terminal from desktop or mobile browsers.
- Use tunnels for remote access while the daemon stays local.
- Keep local project permissions and terminal environment in control.

## Web Hub

Launch and continue sessions from desktop or mobile browsers.

VibeAround Web Hub gives you a browser interface for choosing agents, API profiles, workspaces, and sessions, then continuing the same work across devices.

  </tr>
</table>

- Start new browser sessions or continue existing ones.
- Pick agents, API profiles, workspaces, and sessions from the browser.
- Use desktop and mobile browsers without moving execution to a cloud server.

## Remote Tunnels

Expose VibeAround's local web surfaces only when you choose to.

Remote tunnels are used by Web Hub, Web Terminal, and Preview links. VibeAround keeps the daemon local and starts the selected tunnel provider; owner surfaces require browser pairing, while each Server or Markdown Share transaction uses its own time-scoped access code.

| Tunnel option | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Local only | ✅ Supported | No public tunnel; the daemon listens on loopback. |
| Localtunnel | ✅ Supported | Quick public URL through the managed `localtunnel` npm package or system `npx`. |
| Cloudflare Tunnel | ✅ Supported | Named tunnel via `cloudflared`, tunnel token, and configured hostname. |
| ngrok | ✅ Supported | Uses the ngrok SDK with auth token and optional reserved/static domain. |
| Tailscale Funnel | ✅ Supported | Public `.ts.net` URL through an installed and signed-in Tailscale client. |

## Live Preview

Preview what AI agents are building.

VibeAround opens dev servers and Markdown in one owner page with a collapsible workspace/Preview picker. A local Server owner loads the dev server directly from its loopback origin; tunneled owners remain pairing-protected. Both Server and Markdown targets can mint 10-minute Share transactions protected by reusable six-digit access codes.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://pub-806a1b8456464ce7a6c110f84946697e.r2.dev/documents/v0.7.12/readme/preview-in-a-row.webp" alt="Ask for previews from messaging apps, pair a browser, and open web or Markdown previews" width="92%" />
</p>

- Preview dev servers on their native loopback origin locally, preserving their own fetch, WebSocket, and HMR behavior.
- Reach an owner page through a tunnel after browser pairing.
- Generate copyable Server and Markdown Share messages containing the public URL, access code, and expiry.
- Share a Server page through a page-preview proxy that forwards authenticated GET/HEAD paths, including page data reads; writes, protocol upgrades, service workers, WebSockets, and HMR are unsupported. `/va/*`, owner pages, chat, and review controls are excluded.

<details>
<summary><strong>Security Model</strong></summary>

VibeAround keeps AI coding work on your computer by default.

- Agents run on your computer.
- Provider credentials stay in local VibeAround settings/profile storage.
- The daemon listens on loopback unless you explicitly enable a tunnel.
- Dashboard APIs and WebSocket routes require a local auth token.
- Protected public tunnel surfaces, including Preview owner links, require browser pairing.
- Server and Markdown Share transactions instead use their own six-digit access codes; each Share URL, code, and browser grant expires together after 10 minutes.
- Server Shares are a page-preview transport, not general API compatibility or an API-isolation sandbox: they forward authenticated GET/HEAD paths, including page data reads, while writes, protocol upgrades, service workers, WebSockets, and HMR are unsupported. `/va/*`, owner pages, chat, and review controls are excluded.
- Agent CLIs use your local project permissions.

</details>

## Community

VibeAround is still early, moving fast, and mostly one-person work. My goal is to build an all-in-one agent hub that helps more people embrace AI with less friction and more clarity. Some edges are still rough, from test coverage to interaction details, and I sincerely hope VibeAround can be shaped together with the community. Discussions, code contributions, ideas, shared workflows, and bug reports are always welcome.
