# VibeAround Documentation

VibeAround lets you reach your local AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and more) from the surfaces you already use: IM channels such as Telegram, Slack, and Feishu, a browser dashboard with a full terminal, a desktop control app, and a TUI/CLI. One local runtime, one workspace model, many doors into it.

**New here?** Read in this order: [What is VibeAround](product/what-is-vibearound.md) → [Install](guides/install-and-onboarding.md) → [Quick tour](guides/quick-tour.md) → [Concepts](architecture/concepts.md). Everything else is lookup material.

## Internals

For debugging and changing the code. See the [internals index](internals/README.md) for the full map. How internals content is split:

- **[architecture/](#architecture)** answers *why it is designed this way* — the model, at reader level.
- **[internals/flows/](internals/README.md#flows)** follow *one request through time* — hop by hop with code anchors.
- **[internals/modules/](internals/README.md#modules)** describe *one component in space* — responsibility, key types, invariants, known debt.

If you want to trace behavior, start from the flow; if you want to modify a component, start from the module; the flow and module pages cross-link where they meet. Cross-cutting subsystems get dedicated deep-dives — currently [Launch](internals/launch.md) (env injection, per-OS handling, producers).

## Conventions used in these docs

- `~/.vibearound/` is the data directory on every platform (override with `VIBEAROUND_DATA_DIR`).
- The local server listens on port `12358` by default.
- Shell examples use `va`, the CLI installed by `npm i @vibearound/cli`. The longer alias `vibearound` works everywhere `va` does.
- Every page ends with *Source anchors* — the code files the page derives from — and a *Last verified* version. If you change an anchored file, update the page and bump the version.
- Pages chain with prev/next links following the recommended reading order.
