# Project notes for Claude

A SQLite-backed issue-tracker CLI for AI agents. Module:
`github.com/arjia-labs/clu`. Binary: `clu` (produced by `go build -o clu
./cmd/clu` or `go install ./cmd/clu`).

## Sticky decisions — don't re-debate

- **The tool's name is `clu`.** Inspired by Tron's "Codified Likeness
  Utility" — short, on-theme, no conflict with the upstream `bd`. The
  old `cli` and `bd` names are gone from user-facing surfaces.
- **Don't reintroduce "beads" branding** in user-facing strings (help,
  errors, descriptions). Storage paths use `.clu/` / `CLU_DIR` /
  `data.sqlite`. Default ID prefix is `clu-` but is per-project
  configurable via `.clu/config.yaml` (`id_prefix`).
- The workspace dir is still `beadsv2` on disk — that's just a folder
  name, no cascading effect on imports.
- **Identity is a single concept: agents.** There is no `--as` flag.
  Every place that needs identity uses `-a` / `--agent <name>`:
  - `clu claim -a foo` — foo is the assignee on claim.
  - `clu comment add -a foo …` — foo is the author.
  - `clu approve -a foo` / `clu checkpoint pass -a foo` — foo is the
    approver (informational in the single-user model; see
    `single-user-model` memory).
  - `clu ready -a foo` / `clu list -a foo` — `ready` shows foo's
    pre-assigned + the shared pool; `list` is exact-match.
  Bare `clu claim` defaults assignee to `$USER` and pulls from the
  unassigned pool. `--agent` is the user-facing flag; internally
  there's just one `assignee` column (collapsed in migration v13 —
  the old `agent` lane column is gone).
  Don't reintroduce a separate `--as` flag, and don't reintroduce a
  separate `agent` column — the user/agent distinction was
  deliberately collapsed on this local-only tool.
- **Stack is settled:**
  - SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go — no CGo).
  - **Bun** + sqlitedialect for queries. Raw SQL only for `Claim` (UPDATE …
    RETURNING with subquery WHERE) and the recursive-CTE cycle check.
  - **Kong** for CLI (struct-tag commands, intermixed flags, `IsSet`/env).
  - **Hand-rolled migrations** via `PRAGMA user_version` in
    `internal/store/store.go`'s `migrations[]`.
  - We tried **sqlc**; reverted. Don't propose it again unless the user does.
- **Migrations are append-only.** Never edit a past entry; only add new ones.

## Code conventions

- One file per kong command in `internal/cli/`. Register on the root `CLI`
  struct in `cli.go`; add the name to `completionCmds` in `completion.go`.
- **`r.notice("…")`** for narrative output ("closed bd-X", "claimed …").
  Auto-suppressed by `--quiet` and `--json`. Data output (IDs, lists, JSON,
  whole-issue blocks) goes straight to `r.stdout`.
- **Sentinel errors are entity-specific.** `ErrNotFound` (issues),
  `ErrKVNotFound` (kv). Add a new sentinel rather than overloading.
- **`eachID(r, ids, fn)`** helper centralises variadic-ID commands
  (`close`, `reopen`, `undefer`). Aggregates errors via `errors.Join`,
  emits a JSON array under `--json`.
- **Every `--json` invocation emits exactly one JSON value** on stdout.
  No leading notice, no trailing summary. Read commands → typed object
  or array. Write commands → the affected record(s).
- Sugar verbs (`assign`, `priority`, `tag`, `link`, `describe`) delegate
  to existing store methods; they're 10–20 LOC each.

## Tests

- Store tests: `internal/store/store_test.go`. Use `newTestStore(t)` and the
  package-level `var ctx = context.Background()`.
- CLI tests: `internal/cli/cli_test.go`. Use `newTestCLI(t)`, then
  `c.run(...)` or `c.runFail(...)`.
- **Run before every commit:** `go build ./... && go test ./...`.
- **Smoke test convention:** built binary against `/tmp/<scratch>/`. The
  `demo.sh` script runs the full happy path end-to-end.

## Working docs

These live under **`.sandbox/`** (gitignored — local working notes kept
out of the public repo), not the repo root:

- **`.sandbox/work.md`** is the living planning doc — vision, per-commit
  log, proposed next batches, decisions log, deliberate "skipped" list.
  Update at the end of a batch, not mid-task. Treat the per-commit log as
  append-only.
- **`.sandbox/bugs.md`** is QA findings from manual exploration. Mark items
  as fixed inline; leave the file in place.
- **`.sandbox/product-ideas.md`** is the parking lot for not-yet-built ideas.
- Don't write extra `.md` files in the repo root unless the user asks.

## Not in scope (deliberate)

Upstream beads has these; we chose not to copy:
- Dolt anything — we chose SQLite.
- Memory system (`prime`, `remember`, `recall`) — agent runtime, not tracker.
- Integrations: Jira, Linear, GitHub, GitLab, Notion, ADO.
- `swarm`, `ship`, `convoy` abstractions.
- Generic federation / branch / worktree.

Exception worth knowing: we *did* add an experimental, git-native
`clu sync` (issue state on a `refs/clu/store` ref) — see the
**Sync (git ref)** section below. It is not Dolt, not a server, not a
daemon; it's a manual push/pull that reuses the `export` JSONL format.

## Workflows

Templates live in `internal/workflow/` and instantiate to plain issues
+ deps + labels — no new tables. Two layers:

- `internal/workflow/` — pure: YAML loader, validation, var
  resolution, `MakePlan(Template, vars) → Plan`. No store calls.
- `internal/cli/run.go` + `internal/cli/template.go` — CLI walks the
  Plan, calls `store.Create` per step, writes deps and the
  `run:<parent>` / `step:<id>` labels. Checkpoint steps additionally
  get `checkpoint:pending` and a `cp:<issue-id>` KV entry holding
  `{kind, approvers}` JSON.

Templates are loaded from `.clu/templates/*.yaml`. The format and
shape live in `internal/workflow/template.go`. See `demo-workflow.sh`
for an end-to-end run.

Don't propose adding these without the user explicitly asking.

## Sync (git ref) — experimental

`clu sync` stores the tracker on a dedicated `refs/clu/store` git ref as
JSONL, branch-independently. SQLite stays the working copy / query
engine; the ref is the durable, shareable log. Lives in
`internal/cli/sync.go`. Sticky decisions:

- **Ref namespace is `refs/clu/store`** (not a branch). Deliberately
  outside `refs/heads/*` so it's invisible on GitHub, never triggers
  Actions, and never collides with code branches. Trade-off: not in the
  default fetch refspec, so cross-machine onboarding needs
  `clu sync pull --remote` (or a `.git/config` refspec). Don't move it
  under `refs/heads/` without the user asking.
- **DB is the source of truth; the ref is transport.** Remote pull is
  force-fetch + DB-side reconcile, not a ref-level 3-way merge. Push is
  pure plumbing (`hash-object → mktree → commit-tree → update-ref`) — it
  must never touch the working tree or index. There's a test asserting
  `git status` stays clean across a push; keep it that way.
- **Reuses the `export` JSONL format.** `writeExportJSONL` in
  `export.go` is shared by `clu export` and sync — don't fork it.
- **IDs are already merge-safe** (random hex, repo-scoped prefix — same
  property beads-rs relies on). Don't add a monotonic counter.
- **Reconciliation:** issues LWW by `updated`; tombstones (derived by
  diffing the prior snapshot vs the DB on push) propagate deletes;
  deps/comments are additive; KV is last-sync-wins.
- **Known gap, don't pretend it's solved:** `updated` is unix *seconds*,
  so same-second edits to one issue across clones tie (ties keep local —
  non-commutative). A real version needs a finer stamp + actor tiebreak.
- **No daemon.** Manual `push`/`pull`/`status`/`flush`. Don't add a
  background auto-sync without the user asking.

Tests: `internal/cli/sync_test.go` (round-trip, branch independence,
LWW, two-clone remote propagation + tombstone delete). User-facing docs:
`docs/content/docs/sync.mdx`.

## Workflow expectations

- When asked to "do batch X", break into commits per logical group. Each
  commit must compile clean and pass tests.
- When asked to fix a list of bugs, work in priority order. Make separate
  commits per bug (or per closely-related pair) so each is reviewable.
- When a feature touches multiple files, run the end-to-end smoke test
  (`demo.sh` or an ad-hoc `/tmp/...` workdir) before declaring done. Tests
  verify code correctness, not feature correctness.
- When spawning subagents, prefer worktree isolation; if unavailable in
  the env, do groups sequentially rather than in parallel in the same tree.
