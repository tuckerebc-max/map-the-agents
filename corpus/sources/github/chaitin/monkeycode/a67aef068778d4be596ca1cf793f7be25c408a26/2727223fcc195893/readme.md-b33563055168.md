## What Is MonkeyCode?

MonkeyCode is an open-source **enterprise-grade AI development platform** with built-in development environment management, AI model management, AI task management, and project requirement management. Unlike typical vibe coding tools, MonkeyCode is designed as an AI assistant for professional engineering teams.

- You can deploy MonkeyCode inside your **enterprise network** and share it with your R&D team, so developers can start development tasks quickly while engineering leaders manage AI development workflows centrally.
- You can also use our **online environment** directly. It includes managed development environments, built-in large language models, and native mobile support, so you can use leading AI agents anywhere.

## Features

You do not need to assemble tools, set up environments, or jump between workflows. Give MonkeyCode a requirement and it carries the work from development to validation, turning AI coding into a sustainable workflow.

- **Free to start**: No client download and no local environment setup. Open the browser, create an account, and start your first AI development task in seconds.
- **Cloud development environments**: No dependency on a local development machine. Every task runs behind a real server-side environment, with build, test, and preview workflows completed in the cloud.
- **Broad model support**: GLM, Kimi, MiniMax, Qwen, DeepSeek, and other mainstream models are integrated. You can switch by task type or select a model manually.
- **Native mobile support**: Deep iOS and Android support keeps PC and mobile data in sync, so agents can continue running tasks while you are away from your desk.
- **Fully open source**: The core code is public on GitHub. Anyone can audit, fork, and extend it while keeping control over technical choices and security policies.
- **Private offline deployment**: Enterprises and teams with strict data privacy requirements can deploy MonkeyCode inside their own networks and keep data local.
