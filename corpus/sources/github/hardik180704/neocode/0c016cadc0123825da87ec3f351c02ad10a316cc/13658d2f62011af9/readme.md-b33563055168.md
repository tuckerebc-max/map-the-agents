# NeoCode

NeoCode is an open-source, terminal-native coding agent. It gives you streaming
AI responses, persistent sessions, PLAN and BUILD modes, local repository tools,
NeoLens codebase intelligence, themes, and optional Model Context Protocol (MCP)
integrations without pulling you out of the terminal.

It is built as a Bun monorepo with a terminal client, API server, shared package,
database package, and a Vite-powered landing page.

## Highlights

- Terminal-first coding workflow with a focused OpenTUI interface.
- PLAN mode for read-only investigation and BUILD mode for implementation.
- Persistent sessions that can be reopened from `/sessions`.
- Model selection, agent switching, login, and themes from the command menu.
- NeoLens for local code exploration, workspace search, dependency context, and
  replaying agent activity.
- MCP server discovery through project-local `.neocode/mcp.json`.
- GitHub Releases for standalone binaries on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- Homebrew support for macOS and Linux installs.
- Static landing page in `packages/web`.

## Install

### Homebrew

```sh
brew install Hardik180704/tap/neocode
```

### macOS and Linux

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hardik180704/NeoCode/main/install.sh | sh
```

Alpine Linux users must install the C++ runtime libraries first:

```sh
apk add --no-cache libstdc++ libgcc
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hardik180704/NeoCode/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Standalone binaries are also available from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Hardik180704/NeoCode/releases). They include
the Bun runtime, so users do not need to install Bun or Node.js to run NeoCode.

Current binaries are unsigned. macOS may require manual approval in Privacy &
Security, and Windows may display a Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warning.
Published SHA-256 checksums and GitHub attestations can be used to verify each
download.

## Update NeoCode

Update NeoCode using the same installation method you originally used. Avoid
mixing Homebrew and standalone installations, as multiple `neocode` binaries on
your `PATH` can cause an older version to run.

### Homebrew

```sh
brew update && brew upgrade neocode
```

### macOS and Linux standalone installer

Rerun the installer to download the latest release and replace the existing
binary:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hardik180704/NeoCode/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Windows PowerShell standalone installer

Rerun the installer, then restart the terminal so the updated executable is
used:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hardik180704/NeoCode/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Verify the installed version on any platform:

```sh
neocode --version
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `/upgrade` command manages NeoCode billing. It does not update the CLI.

## Usage

Start NeoCode from inside any project directory:

```sh
cd path/to/project
neocode
```

Common commands:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/new` | Start a new conversation |
| `/agents` | Switch between PLAN and BUILD agents |
| `/models` | Select the AI model |
| `/sessions` | Browse previous sessions |
| `/lens` | Explore the local codebase and inspect agent activity |
| `/mcp` | Inspect configured MCP servers and tool access |
| `/theme` | Change the terminal theme |
| `/login` | Sign in through the browser |

Use `API_URL` to point the CLI at a different NeoCode API during development:

```sh
API_URL=http://localhost:3000 neocode
```

## NeoLens

NeoLens is NeoCode's local codebase explorer and execution-inspection workspace.
It can be opened before a conversation to browse and search the current repository.
During a session it also tracks file reads, edits, checks, failures, dependency
relationships, model usage, duration, and estimated generation cost so you can
understand what changed and why.

Open it at any time with:

```text
/lens
```

The full-screen interface provides three views:

- **Graph** shows TypeScript dependency relationships and highlights files touched
  by the agent.
- **Workspace** provides read-only, line-numbered file previews plus capped filename
  and content search. Press `/` to search, `Enter` to open a file, `Tab` to switch
  panes, and `j`/`k` or the arrow keys to navigate.
- **Timeline** replays tool activity and summarizes changed files, failures, model
  runs, tokens, elapsed time, and estimated cost.

Use `F1`, `F2`, and `F3` to switch between Graph, Workspace, and Timeline when an
active session is available. Selecting a file or event and pressing `Enter` opens
the relevant source file in the Workspace view.

NeoLens is intentionally project-scoped and source stays on the local machine;
the Railway API receives session activity but does not receive file contents.
NeoLens respects common generated directories and root `.gitignore` rules, never
follows symbolic links, hides common credential files, rejects paths outside the
project, and caps indexing, search, and preview work to remain responsive on large
repositories. Start NeoCode inside a real repository so local paths can be resolved
safely.

## MCP Integrations

NeoCode discovers MCP servers from `.neocode/mcp.json` in the active project.
MCP is optional; without it, NeoCode's built-in local tools continue to work.

Start from the included example:

```sh
mkdir -p .neocode
cp .neocode/mcp.example.json .neocode/mcp.json
```

Every MCP tool is denied by default and must have an explicit access policy:

| Policy | Availability |
| --- | --- |
| `read` | Available in PLAN and BUILD modes |
| `write` | Available only in BUILD mode |
| `disabled` | Never exposed to the model |

The special `"*"` policy can classify every otherwise-unlisted tool from a
server, but explicit per-tool policies are recommended.

Secrets should use environment references such as `${env:GITHUB_TOKEN}`.
Resolved secret values stay in the server process and are not returned by the MCP
inspection API. Local stdio servers receive only a small safe set of inherited
process variables plus variables declared in their own `env` block.

Supported transports:

- `stdio` for local MCP server processes.
- Streamable HTTP for remote MCP servers.

MCP clients are scoped to a response or inspection request and always closed
after completion, failure, or interruption.

## Repository Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/cli` | Terminal UI and `neocode` command |
| `packages/server` | API, auth, chat routes, billing hooks, MCP runtime, NeoLens routes |
| `packages/shared` | Shared schemas, model metadata, and NeoLens graph types |
| `packages/database` | Prisma schema, generated client, and database adapter |
| `packages/web` | Vite React landing page |
| `scripts` | Release, packaging, Homebrew, and smoke-test scripts |
| `docs` | Release and operational documentation |

## Development

See the [development guide](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for prerequisites, local
PostgreSQL setup, environment variables, and the full contributor workflow.

Install dependencies:

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

Run the API server:

```sh
bun run dev:server
```

Run the terminal client:

```sh
bun run dev:cli
```

Run the landing page:

```sh
bun run dev:web
```

Build the landing page:

```sh
bun run build:web
```

Run tests:

```sh
bun test
```

Run the complete local quality gate:

```sh
bun run check
```

## Releases

NeoCode releases publish standalone CLI archives for macOS, Linux, and Windows
through GitHub Releases. Homebrew formula updates are handled through the
configured tap repository.

See [docs/RELEASING.md](./docs/RELEASING.md) for the full release and Homebrew
process.
