# 🦡 codebadger

**codebadger** is a containerized **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server that
gives AI agents and LLMs deep, queryable access to a codebase's structure and
data flow through [Joern](https://joern.io/) Code Property Graphs (CPGs).

Point it at a Git repository, a local path, or even a pasted code snippet, and
codebadger builds a CPG and exposes it over MCP — so an assistant can run CPGQL
queries, trace data flow and taint, slice programs, and hunt for vulnerabilities
across Java, C/C++, JavaScript, Python, Go, Kotlin, C#, Ghidra, Jimple, PHP,
Ruby, and Swift.

It's a general-purpose foundation for both **program analysis** (understanding
code structure, call graphs, and data flow) and **vulnerability analysis**
(taint tracking, bug hunting, and PoC development) — useful for **academic
research** as well as **industry** security and engineering work. It's built to
scale to large analysis batches with per-CPG worker pools, memory-aware
scheduling, and a Postgres/Redis backend.

## News

codebadger and its paper - *Bridging Code Property Graphs and Language Models for
Program Analysis* - were accepted at the **Software Vulnerability Management
Workshop @ ICSE 2026**. 🎉
