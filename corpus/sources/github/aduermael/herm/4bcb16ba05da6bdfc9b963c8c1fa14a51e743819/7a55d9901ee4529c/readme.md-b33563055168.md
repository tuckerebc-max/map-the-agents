Herm is a model-agnostic, general-purpose AI agent built for safe, flexible execution. It natively supports multiple isolation methods (containers, in-process Unix-like sandboxes, and host sandboxes such as `sandbox_exec` on macOS or `bubblewrap` on Linux).

The Herm CLI defaults to containers with self-building environments, so you can run anything safely without approval interruptions.

The logo and mascot feature a hermit crab called Herm, representing the hermetic nature of the agent. 🐚

## Herm CLI

**Containerized by default:** Use the CLI on your host; the agent itself runs inside Docker containers and can only access files from your current work directory. No permission prompts.

**Multi-provider** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Grok, OpenRouter, Ollama, Azure OpenAI, Vertex AI, or Bedrock… You can mix and match models, like Grok as the main agent, Haiku for exploration, and Gemini for vision.

**Self-building dev environments** — Herm extends container environments by writing Dockerfiles dynamically. Environments are scoped per project (current work directory).

**100% open-source** — Everything is open: system prompts, skills, tools. No hidden instructions, no black boxes. You can fork it to make it your own.

### Requirements

- macOS or Linux (arm64 and amd64)
- Docker (through [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev)) when using the default container-based isolation

### Install

Use the install method that suits you:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://hermagent.com/install.sh | sh
```

```sh
brew tap aduermael/herm
brew install herm
```

Or read the instructions to [build from source](CONTRIBUTING.md#setup).

### Run

```
herm
```

## Herm app for iOS/macOS

Herm is also distributed as a native iOS and macOS application. It cannot be used as a coding agent in that context, but it has an in-process Unix-like sandbox and a Luau-scriptable runtime that allow it to accomplish a wide variety of tasks fully on-device. Herm can even write programs for itself in that environment, mount file storage, and leverage OS frameworks for web browsing, location, calendars, and more.

Herm for iOS/macOS is not yet available on the App Store, but is in active development in this repository.

## Roadmap

Rough priority order, subject to change.

1. **Benchmarks:** measure Herm against Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build and other coding agents.
2. **PR review bot:** Herm bot (GitHub Action) that reviews pull requests.
3. **Safe connectivity:** Let Herm talk to external APIs and databases without ever seeing your credentials. (We'll probably use [SFAE](https://sfae.io) for this)
