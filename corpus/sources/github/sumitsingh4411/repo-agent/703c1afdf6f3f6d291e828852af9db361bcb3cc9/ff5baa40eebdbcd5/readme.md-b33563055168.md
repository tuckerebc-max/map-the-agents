> **Free Repo Agent** brings a Claude/Cursor/Cline-style **agent** into VS Code. It indexes your whole repository, writes and edits code with inline **Keep / Undo**, runs terminal commands with your approval, **verifies its own work** (typecheck/build → then fixes the errors), lets you **switch models** (DeepSeek **V4 Pro / V4 Flash** with **thinking mode**, or any OpenAI-compatible model), tunes **effort** (fast → max reasoning), **reads images** (paste a UI → build the component), extends itself with **MCP plugins (local & remote)**, learns your codebase, remembers your project, and runs a **staff-engineer pre-commit code review** — all on the affordable DeepSeek API with **no monthly subscription**.

<div align="center">

**Looking for a free Copilot alternative · Cursor alternative · Claude / ChatGPT coding agent · Cline / Continue / Aider alternative?** This is the lightweight, bring-your-own-key one.

## ⚡ Everything it does

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 💬 Repo-aware chat
Ask anything about your codebase. It **indexes your project** and injects the most relevant files into every answer — no copy-pasting context.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🤖 Autonomous agent
Give it a task — it reads files, **edits across many files**, and **runs commands** step by step. Every change is reviewed **inline** with **✓ Keep / ✗ Undo**.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### ✅ Auto-verify & self-fix
After editing it runs your **typecheck/build**, reads the errors, and **fixes them before saying "done"** — no more code that doesn't compile.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 👁️ Vision (image → code)
Paste a **UI screenshot/mockup** and say *"build this component."* **Zero setup** — the default DeepSeek V4.1 Flash reads images with your existing key. Falls back to OCR for code/error screenshots.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🧩 Plugins (MCP)
One-click tools the agent can use — **GitHub, web search, Postgres, Playwright, filesystem** & more — via the **Model Context Protocol**. Add any custom server.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🔍 Staff-engineer code review
Reviews staged changes / files / branches, reads the **full files**, runs a **second audit pass**, and reports **Critical · Quality · Architecture · Testing**. Enforces **your own rules**.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🧠 Model switcher + thinking mode
Switch models from the footer, Claude-style: **DeepSeek V4.1 Flash / V4 Pro** with **thinking mode** (deep reasoning that works *with* tool calls), or point at **OpenAI / OpenRouter / Gemini** for GPT/Claude/Llama.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### ⚡ Effort control
A dial from **fast & cheap → max reasoning**. Higher effort = more tool steps, longer answers, more context, and deeper V4 thinking — you decide speed vs. quality per task.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🧩 Plugins (MCP) — local & remote
One-click tools — **GitHub, web search, Postgres, Playwright, filesystem** & 20+ more — via the **Model Context Protocol**. Install from **npm/GitHub**, a custom command, or a **remote URL**.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### ⌨️ Terminal CLI (like Claude Code)
Prefer the shell? Run the **same autonomous agent in your terminal** — live checklist, file edits, command running, approvals — with no VS Code open. Ships with the extension.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 📖 Learn this codebase + 🧠 memory
One click generates a **knowledge brief** of your project (architecture, conventions, key files) that's injected into every prompt — plus a `memory.md` for your own always-on rules.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 👍 Learns from your feedback
Every reply has **Copy · 👍 · 👎**. A 👎 saves *what was wrong* as a rule the agent follows from then on — and offers a one-click **Retry**. Works with **no folder open** too.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## 🚀 Get started in 60 seconds

**1. Get a DeepSeek API key** → [platform.deepseek.com/api_keys](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) — pay-as-you-go, a few dollars lasts a long time.

**2. Add it to VS Code** → <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> → **`Agent: Set DeepSeek API Key`** (stored in VS Code SecretStorage, never in your repo).

**3. Open chat** → press <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>, or click the **Repo Agent `</>` icon** to dock it beside your code — and start.

> 💡 Type <kbd>/</kbd> in the chat for quick commands: **Plugins, Memory, Reindex, Auto-accept, Vision** and more.

## 🤖 Autonomous agent — self-verifying

Describe a task and watch it work end-to-end:

> *"Add a `/health` route and a test for it, then run the tests."*

1. 📖 Reads the relevant files (from the repo index).
2. ✍️ Proposes edits **inline in your files** with green highlights and **✓ Keep / ✗ Undo**.
3. ▶️ Asks to **Run** any terminal command in a visible *Repo Agent* terminal.
4. ✅ **Auto-verifies** — runs your typecheck/build and **fixes errors** before finishing.
5. ☑️ A **live checklist** ticks each step `pending → in-progress → ✓ done`. Hit **Stop** anytime.

## ⌨️ Terminal CLI — the agent in your shell

Prefer working in the terminal, like **Claude Code**? The same agent runs as a CLI — **no VS Code needed**. It plans a live checklist, reads and edits files, and runs commands in your current directory, **asking before anything that changes them**.

```
◆ Repo Agent v0.11.0 · deepseek-flash · medium effort

› add a /health route and a test for it

  ▶ Add the /health route
  ○ Add a test
  ○ Run the tests

● Read  src/server.ts
● Edit  src/server.ts
  ✎ Edit src/server.ts
    Approve? [y]es / [n]o / [a]lways:
```

**Setup** — the CLI ships **inside the extension** (v0.10.0 or later), so once Repo Agent is installed just point an alias at it:

```bash
# add to ~/.zshrc (or ~/.bashrc), then restart your terminal
alias repo-agent='node "$(ls -dt ~/.vscode/extensions/sumitkumarsingh.free-repo-agent-*/dist/cli.js | head -1)"'
```

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...      # or just run it and paste your key when asked

repo-agent                          # interactive session in the current folder
repo-agent "add a /health route"    # run one task, then keep going
```

| | |
|---|---|
| **Options** | `-m, --model <id>` · `-e, --effort low\|medium\|high\|max` · `-C, --cwd <dir>` · `--base-url <url>` (any OpenAI-compatible provider) · `-y, --yes` (auto-approve) · `--login` (re-enter your key) |
| **In-session** | `/login` · `/model <id>` · `/effort <lvl>` · `/clear` · `/cwd` · `/help` · `/exit` |
| **Controls** | Approve each change with `y` / `n` / `a`lways · **Ctrl-C** stops a run, again quits |

> Your key comes from `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` or `~/.repo-agent.json` (written `chmod 600`, only if you opt in). Pasted the wrong one? `repo-agent --login`.
>
> The CLI keeps its **own** key store — the extension's key lives in VS Code SecretStorage, which a program outside VS Code can't read.

## 🧠 Models & thinking mode — generate the best code

Switch the model from the **🧠 chip in the chat footer** (or the ⚙︎ Options menu), just like Claude:

| Model | Best for |
|---|---|
| **DeepSeek V4.1 Flash** (`deepseek-flash`) | **Newest & the default** — fast, cheap, 1M context, 384K output, and **reads images natively** |
| **DeepSeek V4 Pro** (`deepseek-v4-pro`) | Hardest code & reasoning — top quality (text only) |
| **R1 / V3** (`deepseek-reasoner` / `deepseek-chat`) | Legacy models |

- **Thinking mode** — on the V4 models the agent uses DeepSeek's built-in **deep reasoning that works *with* tool calls**, so it thinks before it edits. It's wired to the **⚡ Effort** dial: off at *Low* (fast/cheap), then *low → high → max* reasoning at *Medium → High → Max*.
- **Not just DeepSeek** — the extension speaks an **OpenAI-compatible API**, so set a custom model id + point `repoAgent.deepseek.baseUrl` at **OpenAI, OpenRouter, Gemini, or any provider** to run the agent on **GPT-4o, Claude, Llama, Qwen** and more.

## 📖 Learn this codebase

Run **Agent: Learn This Codebase** (or `/` → *Learn this codebase*) and it indexes your repo and writes a thorough **knowledge brief** — purpose, stack, architecture, key files, data models, conventions, build/run/test — to `.repo-agent/knowledge.md`. That brief is injected into **every** prompt, so the agent knows your project instantly. Re-run anytime to refresh.

## 👁️ Vision — paste an image, build the component

**Zero setup.** The default model — **DeepSeek V4.1 Flash** — is **natively multimodal**, so it reads images with the DeepSeek key you already have. One model, one key, nothing to configure.

Just **paste a screenshot/mockup** into the chat and ask *"build this as a React component."* The image becomes a precise implementation spec, and the agent builds the files.

```text
/  →  👁️ Vision  →  switch provider (optional):
     • DeepSeek V4.1 Flash — same key, no setup   ← default
     • Google Gemini — FREE (no credit card)
     • Ollama / LM Studio — local, no key
     • OpenRouter (free models) · OpenAI · Custom
```

Vision off, or no key? Images fall back to **OCR** — perfect for screenshots of errors or code.

## 🧩 Plugins (MCP) — give the agent superpowers

Open the **🧩 Plugins** panel (or type <kbd>/</kbd> → **Plugins**) and add tools with one click. Built on the **Model Context Protocol** — the same plugin standard Claude uses — so the entire MCP ecosystem works here. Add from the built-in catalog, **npm/GitHub**, a **custom command**, or a **remote URL**.

📖 **[Full guide: how to use plugins →](docs/PLUGINS.md)**

| | Plugin | What the agent can do |
|---|---|---|
| 📁 | **Filesystem** | Read/write/search files in a folder you allow |
| 🐙 | **GitHub** | Search repos/issues, read files, open PRs & issues |
| 🦊 | **GitLab** | Repos, issues, merge requests |
| 🔎 | **Web Search** (Brave) | Search the web for up-to-date info |
| 🦅 | **Tavily** | AI-grade web search & page extraction |
| 🌐 | **Fetch** | Fetch a URL as clean text/markdown |
| 🎭 | **Playwright** | Drive a real browser: click, fill, scrape, screenshot |
| 🐘 | **Postgres** · 🗃️ **SQLite** | Query your databases |
| 🪜 | **Sequential Thinking** | Structured step-by-step reasoning |
| 📚 | **Context7** | Up-to-date docs & snippets for any library |
| 🧠 | **Memory** | A knowledge graph the agent reads/writes across tasks |
| 🗺️ | **Google Maps** · 💬 **Slack** | Places/directions · channels & messages |

> ➕ **Add any MCP server** — from **npm/GitHub** (paste `@scope/server` or `owner/repo`), a **custom command**, or a **remote URL** (hosted servers over Streamable HTTP, with an optional bearer token). Keys are stored securely in VS Code SecretStorage. **[Full guide → docs/PLUGINS.md](docs/PLUGINS.md)**

## 🧠 Project memory — `memory.md`

Type <kbd>/</kbd> → **Memory** to create a `memory.md` at your repo root. Its contents are injected into **every** chat and agent prompt, so the agent always remembers your project:

```markdown
# Project Memory

## Project
- Stack: React + TypeScript + Vite, Node/Express API, Postgres
- Run: `npm run dev` · Tests: `npm test`

## Conventions
- 2-space indent, single quotes, named exports.
- Always add types and a test. Never commit secrets or use `any`.
```

Delete the file to turn memory off. (You can also drop a `.agent.md` / `.claude.md` — it reads those too.)

## 🔍 Staff-engineer code review + your own rules

Stage changes (`git add …`) → **Agent: Review Staged Changes** (also in the Source Control title bar). Findings appear in the **Problems** panel, the **Review Results** sidebar, and **inline** — each with **Fix with AI**, **Ignore**, and **Commit Anyway**.

**Make it enforce YOUR standards.** Run **Agent: Create Review Guidelines** to scaffold a `system-design.md`. The reviewer reads it before every review and flags any change that breaks a rule — quoting the rule:

```markdown
# Review Guidelines & System Design

## Architecture
- UI → services → data access. UI must not import data-access directly.

## Review rules
- No `console.log` in committed code — use the logger.
- Every new exported function ships with a test.
- No secrets in source; read them from config/secret storage.
```

## 🧭 Repo-aware indexing & retrieval

On first run, Repo Agent **indexes your repository** — symbols, structure, and optional AI per-file summaries — into a local cache (`.agent-cache/`). Every question then pulls in the **most relevant files automatically**, so answers fit *your* codebase. Re-run anytime with **Agent: Reindex Repository**, and tune what's indexed via `repoAgent.indexing.*` and how many files are injected via `repoAgent.retrieval.maxFiles`.

## ⚙️ Commands

<kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> → type **"Agent:"**

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `Agent: Chat` / `Open Chat (beside editor)` | Open the chat panel |
| `Agent: Generate Code` | Describe code to generate |
| `Agent: Run Agent (autonomous)` | Run a task that edits files & runs commands |
| `Agent: Review Staged Changes` / `Review Current File` | Pre-commit / file review |
| `Agent: Create Review Guidelines` | Scaffold a `system-design.md` of review rules |
| `Agent: Learn This Codebase` | Generate a persistent project knowledge brief |
| `Agent: Edit Memory` | Edit the always-on `memory.md` |

</details>

## 🔒 Privacy & security

- **Your keys stay secret.** DeepSeek/vision keys and any plugin or remote‑MCP tokens live in VS Code **SecretStorage** — never in your code, settings, or the extension's storage, and never logged.
- **No telemetry.** Zero analytics/tracking. The only network calls go to endpoints **you** configure — your AI provider, your vision provider, and any MCP servers you add. Your code/context is sent to *your* AI provider only when you make a request.
- **The agent stays in your project.** File edits are blocked from absolute paths and `..` traversal; commands run in a **visible terminal with your approval**; edits show inline with **Keep / Undo**.
- **Plugins run third‑party code** — add only servers you trust. Plugin tools **ask before running** by default (`plugins.autoRun` is off); enable it only for trusted plugins.
- **Sensitive generated files?** `memory.md` and `.repo-agent/knowledge.md` are injected into prompts and committed by default — add them to `.gitignore` if private:
  ```gitignore
  .agent-cache/
  .repo-agent/
  memory.md
  ```
