# Windows port evaluation

## Executive summary

ADE does not need a ground-up Windows port. Most platform foundations already
exist: Windows named pipes, PowerShell/cmd PTYs, Git for Windows resolution,
process-tree termination, Windows native provider packages, `node-pty`, a
vendored x64 `crsqlite.dll`, NSIS packaging, CLI wrappers, and extensive
artifact validation.

The repository history confirms this. Windows foundations landed in April-May
2026 (`#186`, `#213`, and `#281`), and the release was deliberately made
macOS-only on June 12 in `#561`. However, simply uncommenting the Windows
workflow would not produce a dependable release.

Recommended direction:

- Target Windows 10/11 x64 using the existing per-user NSIS installer.
- Ship a bounded "Windows x64 preview" PR instead of promising complete
  platform parity.
- Explicitly defer Windows ARM64, Windows as a remotely installable ADE brain,
  native Windows computer use, and iOS Simulator support.

The highest risk is the packaged background brain lifecycle, not Electron
rendering or TypeScript compilation.

## Implementation status on `windows-native-build`

The code changes recommended by this evaluation are now implemented on the
working branch:

- The Windows brain runs through a per-user/channel current-user startup entry
  and a BOM-marked PowerShell launcher that restores the complete resolved
  runtime environment without requiring administrator access. Legacy Scheduled
  Task cleanup fails closed, and runtime/desktop-bridge named pipes are isolated by canonical ADE
  home, channel, and current user. Windows IPC servers explicitly retain
  Node's intended-user-only named-pipe access flags; effective cross-account
  access remains a clean-VM proof gate.
- Tracked CLI continuation uses structured command/argv/env descriptors on
  Windows for Claude, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, and Droid. App Control likewise
  uses structured Windows launches for direct Electron/package scripts and
  platform-specific shell fallbacks. Fresh provider intent is materialized on
  the runtime that owns the lane, so a Windows renderer cannot send
  PowerShell wrappers or Windows skill paths to a pinned macOS/Linux runtime.
- The Windows x64 package contains every supported Darwin/Linux remote-runtime
  sidecar. Required `win-unpacked` package smoke validates the CLI/TUI,
  ConPTY, bundled Claude/Codex/OpenCode binaries, Cursor native helpers,
  Cursor/Droid SDK entry points, update authority, and a real `crsqlite.dll`
  CRR mutation. The NSIS uninstaller stops and removes the Windows background
  service, then removes only the terminal shim and user `PATH` entry owned by
  that installation. Installing the generated NSIS package remains a separate
  external gate.
- Required pull-request CI now builds an unsigned NSIS preview on
  `windows-latest`. Production Windows build and public release are separately
  gated; the signed path requires a pinned Authenticode identity, matching
  signer for installer and `ADE.exe`, and a trusted RFC3161 timestamp.
- The updater authority follows the repository that built the package. The
  source default remains upstream `arul28/ADE`, while CI passes
  `ADE_RELEASE_REPOSITORY=${{ github.repository }}` for fork builds. Windows
  download links and release assets remain disabled until the public gates
  are explicitly enabled.
- Windows chrome, AppUserModelID, microphone-denial guidance, sync health, and
  platform-aware copy/navigation are implemented. macOS-native Notch,
  computer-use, and iOS Simulator actions are hidden or capability-blocked
  while App Control, Browser, and proof ingestion remain available.
- The Windows developer loop now uses a per-user named pipe, invokes local
  JavaScript CLI entry points instead of fragile global `.cmd` shims, strips
  inherited runtime parent/idle shutdown controls, and waits for tsup's
  explicit successful-build signal before starting or restarting Electron.
  Runtime startup remains bounded at 30 seconds and reports an early child
  exit immediately. The launcher records whether it created the detached
  runtime and shuts down only that owned runtime when Electron exits or the
  developer interrupts the command, so a failed or closed dev session does
  not leave a polling runtime behind.
- Windows background probes and worker processes are created with hidden
  console windows. This includes background-service status checks that the
  desktop polls every two seconds, provider/auth/usage/Git/Tailscale probes,
  runtime and PTY workers, and service install/uninstall operations. The Unix
  `ps` resource sampler now reports `unsupported-platform` on Windows without
  launching a process. These protections address a host-loss incident where
  visible PowerShell console windows were repeatedly created and continued
  after the Electron window closed.
- Windows sync-host startup now rejects stale lock files when the recorded PID
  has been reused by a different executable and records process start time for
  future locks. The projectless brain uses the same 8787-8999 fallback range
  as project-scoped sync instead of waiting forever on 8787. This matters on
  Windows hosts where Tailscale or another local service already owns 8787.

No source blocker is currently known for the bounded Windows x64 desktop
preview. The remaining release work is external proof: clean standard-user
Windows 10/11 install/logoff/reboot/uninstall,
Stable+Beta and two-user isolation, physical-iPhone CRR/firewall testing,
provider/PTY special-character coverage, supported macOS/Linux remote
bootstrap, and signed-installer launch/relaunch/background-brain recovery.
Do not enable `ADE_WINDOWS_PUBLIC_RELEASE_ENABLED=1` or
`VITE_ADE_WINDOWS_DOWNLOAD_ENABLED=1` before those checks pass.

Maintainers can follow
[`docs/playbooks/windows-signed-release.md`](docs/playbooks/windows-signed-release.md)
for signing, draft-release verification, publication,
and website-enable procedure. The exact-SHA manifest, redacted evidence layout,
and full-system acceptance inventory live in
[`docs/development/windows-release-proof.md`](docs/development/windows-release-proof.md);
installed-host diagnosis is in
[`docs/development/windows-support.md`](docs/development/windows-support.md).

Windows standalone install and `ade brain update` are implemented. Windows is
still not an SSH-bootstrap target, and public readiness requires exact-SHA
evidence for the standalone executable, native archive, `install.ps1`, and
`SHA256SUMS` from the immutable proof run. Missing or mismatched evidence blocks
release; a manual binary copy is not acceptable proof.

## Current readiness

| Projects, lanes, Git, files | Windows-aware paths, Git, and junction code exist | Clean-VM functional testing |
| Terminal/PTY | Structured Windows launch/resume, runtime-host materialization, and taskkill cleanup are implemented | Installed provider/ConPTY matrix |
| Background brain | No-admin per-user/channel startup launcher and NSIS uninstall cleanup are implemented | Logoff/reboot/update/uninstall proof |
| Updater | Fork authority and fail-closed signing/publication gates are implemented | Validate automatic updating after two signed Windows releases exist |

| iOS Simulator/Xcode Preview | macOS-only and hidden on Windows | No Windows work required |
| Windows remote brain host | Explicitly rejected | Separate project |
| Windows ARM64 | Native payloads incomplete | Separate project |

The repository's own
[Windows port document](docs/development/windows-port-lane.md#already-in-this-branch-do-not-re-implement)
accurately lists the foundations, but its release claims are stale.

## Original release-blocking findings

The sections below preserve the static-evaluation rationale that shaped the
implementation. Each release-blocking source finding below has an
implementation on this branch; effective named-pipe access, clean-VM
login-startup behavior, and signed-update behavior still require the
external proof gates above.

### 1. The scheduled background brain drops required environment variables

This is the most serious defect.

The service command carries `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`, `NODE_PATH`, channel, ADE
home, and runtime configuration in
[`common.ts`](apps/ade-cli/src/serviceManager/common.ts). However,
`renderWindowsCommand()` serializes only the executable and arguments.

The resulting task registers roughly:

```text
ADE.exe cli.cjs serve
```

without `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`. On a clean machine this can reopen the
Electron GUI instead of starting the CLI brain. Because ADE expects the service
to own the primary runtime pipe, this can leave the desktop without its normal
synchronized runtime.

The PR should install a dedicated service launcher or safely serialize all
required environment variables, then prove install, start, logoff/logon,
update, and uninstall on a clean machine without Node installed.

### 2. Background-service registration must not require administrator access

Windows Task Scheduler rejects task creation from a standard user. ADE's
per-user installer must not require elevation merely to start its background
runtime at login.

The implementation now writes a channel- and user-qualified value under the
current user's normal Windows startup registry key. A hidden PowerShell
supervisor starts the packaged runtime, records its process identity, and lets
status and uninstall stop only that ADE-owned process tree. Old Scheduled Task
registrations are removed during migration.

### 3. The Windows package cannot satisfy its own validator

The Windows validator requires Darwin and Linux x64/arm64 remote-runtime
sidecars in
[`validate-win-artifacts.mjs`](apps/desktop/scripts/validate-win-artifacts.mjs),
but [`package.json`](apps/desktop/package.json) copies only the Darwin
artifacts.

A re-enabled `dist:win` should therefore fail post-package validation.

The product decision is either:

- Include all four sidecar pairs so Windows can bootstrap existing macOS/Linux
  remote runtimes; or
- Reduce the Windows remote-bootstrap contract, gate the feature, and update
  the validator accordingly.

Including everything is simpler for a first preview but increases installer
size. On-demand, checksummed sidecar downloads would be cleaner later.

### 4. Provider resume and App Control commands still contain POSIX syntax

Fresh provider launches are mostly structured and Windows-aware. Resume and
fallback paths frequently generate shell strings instead.

Examples include OpenCode environment assignments and Droid resume commands in
[`cliLaunch.ts`](apps/desktop/src/shared/cliLaunch.ts). App Control's
package-script rewrite emits `PATH=<dir>:$PATH` and POSIX quoting in
[`appControlLaunchCommand.ts`](apps/desktop/src/main/services/appControl/appControlLaunchCommand.ts),
even though the command is later typed into PowerShell or cmd.

These paths will fail with some configurations and paths containing spaces,
quotes, `$`, `%`, `&`, or backticks.

The durable fix is a structured invocation contract:

```ts
{
  command,
  args,
  env,
  displayCommand,
}
```

Shell text should remain only for commands that genuinely require a shell,
with separate PowerShell and cmd quoting.

### 5. Windows named-pipe identity is not sufficiently isolated

The machine pipe name is derived only from the basename of ADE home in
[`machineLayout.ts`](apps/ade-cli/src/services/projects/machineLayout.ts). The
default `.ade` therefore produces the same global named-pipe name for every
Windows user.

The PR should derive pipe names from the canonical ADE home, channel, and
current user SID/hash, and verify that the pipe ACL is limited to the intended
user. Test two Windows users and Stable/Beta side by side.

### 6. Release and update configuration is disabled or points at upstream

The Windows build, download, validation, and upload blocks are commented out
in [`.github/workflows/release-core.yml`](.github/workflows/release-core.yml).
There is also no Windows runner in normal PR CI.

At evaluation time, the packaged updater was hardcoded to upstream
`arul28/ADE` in:

- [`apps/desktop/package.json`](apps/desktop/package.json)
- [`apps/desktop/resources/app-update.yml`](apps/desktop/resources/app-update.yml)
- [`autoUpdateService.ts`](apps/desktop/src/main/services/updates/autoUpdateService.ts)

A Windows build published by another fork would check upstream for updates,
where the corresponding Windows artifacts might not exist.

The distribution repository should be build metadata generated from
`github.repository`. The production `setFeedURL` override should be removed or
centralized. Electron-builder recommends using its generated `app-update.yml`;
its NSIS target already supports Windows auto-update and `latest.yml`
metadata. See the
[electron-builder auto-update documentation](https://www.electron.build/docs/features/auto-update/).

### 7. Public signing currently fails open

The existing configuration supports Authenticode, but missing secrets result
in an unsigned installer. The validator only checks signatures when an opt-in
flag is set.

Recommended policy:

- PR CI may build an unsigned artifact.
- Release CI must fail if signing is unavailable.
- Verify the installer and installed `ADE.exe`, publisher identity, and RFC
  3161 timestamp.
- Publish the installer, blockmap, and `latest.yml` atomically.
- Use Microsoft Artifact Signing or a stable organizational Authenticode
  certificate.

Electron-builder exposes `forceCodeSigning` specifically to prevent silently
unsigned production builds. See the
[electron-builder signing documentation](https://www.electron.build/docs/features/code-signing/).

Signing will not automatically eliminate every early SmartScreen prompt.
Microsoft notes that even valid OV/EV-signed applications can be classified as
unrecognized until publisher/file reputation develops; unsigned releases must
rebuild reputation for every version. See
[Microsoft's SmartScreen guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/package-and-deploy/smartscreen-reputation).

## Product and UX work

The build PR should also include a focused platform pass:

- Make the Windows title bar explicit.
  [`main.ts`](apps/desktop/src/main/main.ts) unconditionally uses
  `hiddenInset`, macOS traffic-light positioning, and a renderer header with
  80 px of left padding. Verify caption buttons, dragging, double-click
  maximize, Snap Layouts, and DPI scaling.
- Hide or clearly disable iOS Simulator, Xcode Preview, native Notch, and local
  OS computer-use actions.
- Keep browser/App Control capture and proof-file ingestion enabled where
  supported.
- Replace visible "This Mac", "Reveal in Finder", `Command` key, and macOS
  Keychain wording with platform-aware labels. Preserve the internal
  `this-mac` identifier because it is a protocol/persistence invariant.
- Update the website.
  [`DownloadPage.tsx`](apps/web/src/app/pages/DownloadPage.tsx) currently says
  Windows installers are not published.
- Add Windows-specific microphone denial guidance; the current flow treats
  non-macOS access as automatically granted.
- Add a Windows sync-health surface. A missing or unloadable `crsqlite.dll`
  currently degrades sync primarily through logs.
- Test Windows Defender Firewall behavior for LAN phone pairing and provide
  actionable relay/Tailscale guidance.
- Add `setAppUserModelId` if packaged toast identity proves unreliable.

The supported OS floor should be Windows 10/11 x64. ADE uses Electron 41,
while Electron 23 and newer require Windows 10 or later. See
[Electron platform support](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/breaking-changes).

## Recommended PR boundary

A reviewable first submission should be titled along the lines of
"Add Windows x64 preview build" and contain the following work.

### 1. Runtime correctness

- Fix the scheduled-task environment, channel naming, and locale-safe status.
- Use user/channel-scoped named pipes.
- Introduce structured provider resume commands.
- Fix App Control's Windows launch handling.
- Generate sync singleton recovery commands that do not suggest `launchctl`
  or `/bin/kill`.

### 2. Packaging and CI

- Resolve the remote-sidecar mismatch.
- Add `windows-latest` PR packaging and smoke validation.
- Load `crsqlite.dll` and perform a minimal CRR operation during packaged
  smoke.
- Probe the bundled CLI/TUI, PTY, and provider executables.
- Keep the target x64-only.

### 3. Release and updates

- Parameterize the fork's release authority.
- Restore the release/publish workflow.
- Fail closed on production signing.
- Validate installed N-to-N+1 signed updating after two releases exist.

### 4. Platform UX and documentation

- Add an explicit Windows title bar and capability-driven navigation.
- Use neutral copy and platform-aware shortcuts.
- Add Windows download and analytics links.
- Correct stale architecture and Windows-port documentation.

Public download enablement should remain gated until the signed installer
passes the clean-host checks. If certificate provisioning is not ready, the PR
can still produce an unsigned internal CI artifact while leaving public
publishing disabled.

## Merge gates

At minimum:

- Test Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 x64 clean standard-user VMs.
- Install without Node or administrator rights.
- Verify first launch, app restart, logoff/logon, and uninstall/reinstall.
- Install Stable and Beta simultaneously.
- Open/create a project; create/delete a lane; exercise worktree, junction,
  commit, rebase, and conflict flows.
- Exercise PowerShell and cmd PTYs: Unicode, resize, Ctrl+C, cancellation, and
  child-tree cleanup.
- Test fresh launch and resume for Claude, Codex, Cursor, Droid, and OpenCode.
- Test paths and prompts containing spaces, Unicode, quotes, `$`, `%`, and
  `&`.
- Load packaged `crsqlite.dll` and complete a bidirectional Windows
  desktop-to-physical-iPhone CRR sync.
- Use the Windows desktop to control an existing macOS/Linux remote runtime.
- Exercise the built-in browser, downloads, proof ingest, and App Control CDP
  capture.
- Test `ade://` cold/hot deep links, file associations, the PATH wrapper, and
  uninstall cleanup.
- Test DPI at 100/125/150/200 percent, multiple monitors, Snap Layouts, high
  contrast, and keyboard navigation.

## Explicit follow-ups

These should not block the first Windows desktop build:

- Windows as a remotely installable ADE brain.
- Native Windows computer use using Windows Graphics Capture/UI Automation.
- Signed N-to-N+1 automatic-update testing, including cache/retry/relaunch,
  HKCU startup-supervisor recovery, legacy Scheduled Task cleanup, data
  preservation, and rejection of tampered or incorrectly signed updates.
- Windows ARM64 after all native/provider payloads are available.
- Windows resource telemetry and general orphan-agent recovery.

## Readiness and uncertainty

- The source and CI support a credible internal Windows x64 preview.
- Public Windows x64 readiness requires upstream signing configuration and the
  external proof gates below.
- Largest uncertainty: installed, signed runtime behavior across clean Windows
  hosts and updates.

The initial assessment was a read-only static evaluation. Implementation and
targeted automated validation have since been completed on this branch.
A full local NSIS package still requires the CI-produced Darwin/Linux runtime
sidecars; the required Windows CI job materializes them before packaging.
No claim is made here that the external clean-VM checks or automatic-update
follow-up have passed.

## Automated validation observed

The source implementation was validated on Windows with:

- A bounded no-GUI lifecycle proof that started an isolated hidden runtime
  while this host's Tailscale service owned port 8787, connected over its
  named pipe, requested graceful shutdown, and confirmed that the pipe was
  released.
- Desktop typecheck, lint, build, documentation validation, web typecheck and
  build.
- The required Windows release contract, updater, packaging-smoke,
  CR-SQLite, ConPTY, App Control, microphone, window-chrome, preload, sync UI,
  provider-launch, and platform-copy focused suites.
- ADE CLI typecheck/build, 328 CLI tests, 59 service-manager tests, and 1,045
  TUI tests.
- `git diff --check`.

The legacy full test suites still contain Windows-host baseline failures in
POSIX-only fixtures, Unix-socket browser tests, chmod assertions, and several
SQLite teardown races. Focused Windows production-path tests are green, but
those baseline failures should be cleaned up in follow-up work so the entire
local suite is signal-bearing on Windows.
