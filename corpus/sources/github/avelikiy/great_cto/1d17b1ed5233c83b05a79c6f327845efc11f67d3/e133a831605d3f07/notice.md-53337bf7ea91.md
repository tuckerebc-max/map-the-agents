`great_cto` bundles, adapts, or references work from the projects below. The
original license of each work is preserved; see the specific files for full
terms.

## agent-style (yzhao062/agent-style)

- Upstream: https://github.com/yzhao062/agent-style (pinned v0.3.1)
- Upstream license: CC-BY-4.0 (documentation / rules) and MIT (enforcement lists)
- Adapted files in this repo:
  - `skills/great_cto/prose-style.md` — subset of 7 rules from upstream `RULES.md`
    (CC-BY-4.0). Directive text and one BAD/GOOD pair per rule adapted;
    rationale condensed for agent-context budget. Upstream carries 5+ examples
    per rule and per-source citations (Strunk & White, Orwell, Pinker, Gopen &
    Swan) — consult upstream for the full blocks.
  - `agents/_shared/prose-deny.txt` — reference-only subset of upstream
    `enforcement/deny-phrases.txt` (MIT). Trimmed to phrases that fire in
    great_cto agent output (audit findings, QA/CSO reports, CHANGELOG). The
    file is a human-readable reference; the mechanical warn-grep in
    `agents/qa-engineer.md` inlines a smaller curated pattern list.

Applied rules: RULE-01 (curse of knowledge), RULE-03 (abstract vs concrete),
RULE-04 (needless words), RULE-05 (dying metaphors), RULE-08 (claim
calibration), RULE-A (bullet overuse), RULE-H (citation discipline for
factual claims).

## ui-ux-pro-max (nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill)

- Upstream: https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill
- Upstream license: MIT (preserved at `skills/ui-ux-pro-max/LICENSE`)
- Vendored files in this repo (`skills/ui-ux-pro-max/`):
  - `SKILL.md` — design-intelligence skill (50+ styles, 161 palettes, 99 UX
    guidelines, 161 product types) covering landing pages, dashboards, admin
    panels, and mobile apps across React/Next/Vue/Svelte/SwiftUI/React Native/
    Flutter/Tailwind/shadcn.
  - `data/` — the CSV knowledge base (`landing.csv`, `app-interface.csv` with
    iOS/Android/React Native rules, `styles.csv`, `ux-guidelines.csv`, etc.).
  - `scripts/` — the design-system generator / search helpers (Python).
  - Trimmed: upstream `cli/`, `screenshots/`, `preview/`, marketing README, and
    the sibling skills (`design`, `banner-design`, `slides`, …) were not vendored.
    `data`/`scripts` symlinks were dereferenced to real files.
- Mounted by: `agents/design-advisor.md` (design planning).

## anydesign (uxKero/anydesign)

- Upstream: https://github.com/uxKero/anydesign
- Upstream license: MIT (preserved at `skills/anydesign/LICENSE`)
- Vendored files in this repo (`skills/anydesign/`):
  - `SKILL.md`, `scripts/`, `references/`, `requirements.txt` — analyze an image /
    URL / Figma file and emit a structured `design.md` (token system + component
    inventory + reconstruction notes) for building UI to a reference.
  - Trimmed: upstream `examples/` (~2.6 MB) and README/CHANGELOG were not vendored.
- Mounted by: `agents/design-advisor.md` (reverse-engineering a design reference).

## handoff (techwolf-ai/ai-first-toolkit)

- Upstream: https://github.com/techwolf-ai/ai-first-toolkit (`plugins/session-tools/skills/handoff/SKILL.md`)
- Upstream license: MIT (Copyright (c) 2026 TechWolf)
- Idea adapted, no text or code copied: a session note should record the run state it
  leaves behind, a command that proves each "done" claim, and the next step as the first
  action; the reader should flag a note that is older than the latest commits and read the
  goal and first step back before acting.
- Implemented in: `scripts/lib/handoff-state.mjs`, `commands/save.md`, `commands/resume.md`.

## Codex plugin hooks (agentlas-ai/Agentlas-OS)

- Upstream: https://github.com/agentlas-ai/Agentlas-OS (`codex/plugins/*/hooks/hooks.json`,
  `agentlas_cloud/memory_hook.py`)
- Upstream license: Apache-2.0 (Copyright 2026 Agentlas)
- Ideas adapted, no text or code copied:
  - a Codex plugin can ship hooks, and a guard can read Codex's `apply_patch` by the file
    lines in the patch text (verified on our own probe plugin before relying on it) —
    `.codex-plugin/hooks.json`, `scripts/hooks/codex-adapter.mjs`;
  - before an edit, tell the model which files import the one being changed, which tests
    cover it and what is usually changed with it — `scripts/hooks/edit-impact.mjs`;
  - a protected-path guard judges the write a shell command makes, not the tool that
    makes it — `shellWriteTargets()` in `scripts/hooks/frozen-gates-guard.mjs`.
  - a recorded lesson is shown when a call touches what it names (its evidence files,
    paths, flags, identifiers), with keys most lessons share dropped —
    `scripts/hooks/lesson-tripwire.mjs`.
