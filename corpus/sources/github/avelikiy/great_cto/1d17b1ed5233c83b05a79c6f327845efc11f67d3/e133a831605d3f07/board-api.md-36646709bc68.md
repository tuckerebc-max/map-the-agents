# Board API

[← back to README](../README.md)

The board (`great-cto board` → `http://localhost:3141`) exposes a JSON API for external integrations and smoke tests. Every route is a top-level `if (pathname === '/api/...')` block in `packages/board/server.mjs` — read the source if a behaviour surprises you.

## Endpoints

> All list endpoints return **raw arrays** or top-level fields, not wrapped objects. Smoke scripts that test `data.projects` will see `undefined` and falsely report empty data.

| Endpoint | Method | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/projects` | GET | `Project[]` — array of `{slug, archetype, path, ...}` |
| `/api/tasks?project=<slug>` | GET | `Task[]` — array of `{id, title, status, ...}` |
| `/api/tasks` | POST | Create task (body: `{title, priority, agent?}`); returns 409 without `.beads/` |
| `/api/tasks/<id>/history` | GET | `{events: [...]}`; 404 for unknown id |
| `/api/agents-installed` | GET | `{agents: [...], total: N}` |
| `/api/metrics?project=<slug>` | GET | `{tasks, velocity, cost, qa, security, agents, agents_cost}` |
| `/api/cost?project=<slug>&days=30` | GET | `{series, total_llm, total_human, ...}` |
| `/api/memory?project=<slug>` | GET | `{layers: [...11], patterns: [...]}` |
| `/api/inbox?project=<slug>` | GET | `{pending_gates, p0_open, blocked, approval_tokens, ...}` — each pending gate carries the `token` a decision on it must present (ADR-024); `approval_tokens.state` is `unreadable` when tokens could not be issued |
| `/api/logs?project=<slug>` | GET | `{logs: [...]}` |
| `/api/decisions?limit=20` | GET | `Decision[]` |
| `/api/pipeline?project=<slug>` | GET | `Stage[]` — 8 SDLC stages with status |
| `/api/gates/<id>` | POST | Approve/reject gate (body: `{action, reason?, token, confirm?}`). `token` comes from that gate's `/api/inbox` entry and is single-use; `confirm` is the typed gate name, required to approve an expensive or unclassified gate. 403 `refused-token` / `refused-expired` / `refused-confirm`; 409 `refused-stale` with `changed` paths when the project changed since the gate was listed; 409 without `.beads/` and without `tasks.md` |
| `/api/turns?project=<slug>&limit=10` | GET | `{state, sessions, why?}` — agent turn snapshots (ADR-023), newest session first: `{session, turns, newestTurn, newestAt}`. `state` is `none` outside git, `unreadable` if git refused, `live` otherwise |
| `/api/turns/diff?project=<slug>&session=<id>&turn=<n>` | GET | `{state:'ok', paths, patch, truncated}` — one turn's unified diff and every changed path; the patch is cut at 200 KB. 400 for a bad session or turn, 404 for a turn that does not exist |
| `/api/router-key` | GET | `{state, from, fingerprint, model, problems, verification}` — whether a judge key is stored, never the key. `verification` is the last live check for this fingerprint, or `null`; GET makes no network request |
| `/api/router-key/verify` | POST | `{state, fingerprint, checkedAt, http?, limit?, usage?, reason?}` — asks OpenRouter (`GET /api/v1/key`, free) whether the stored key is live. `state` is `verified` (200), `rejected` (401/403), `unreachable` (no answer, timeout, any other status) or `absent`. 403 from another origin |
| `/api/healthz` | GET | `{ok: true}` |

## Common gotcha — array vs object

Smoke scripts often assume `{projects: [...]}`. The actual shape is just `[...]`. Use:

```python
import urllib.request, json
data = json.load(urllib.request.urlopen("http://127.0.0.1:3141/api/projects"))
assert isinstance(data, list), "endpoint returns array directly"
print(f"projects: {len(data)}")
```

```bash
curl -sf "http://127.0.0.1:3141/api/tasks?project=Test" | jq 'length'
```

## Error responses

POST endpoints return structured errors when state is missing:

```json
{ "error": "beads_not_initialized",
  "message": "No .beads/ directory found in <cwd>. Initialize with 'bd init' or set BEADS_DIR.",
  "cwd": "/path/to/proj",
  "hint": "Run 'bd init' in the project root, then retry." }
```

HTTP `409 Conflict` is returned in this case (not `500`). The UI can render an "Initialize project" button instead of an opaque error.

## SSE stream

```bash
curl -N "http://127.0.0.1:3141/api/sse"
# event: task:created
# data: {...}
# event: task:closed
# data: {...}
```

Events fire within ~1s of underlying state changes (Beads writes + verdict appends).

## Regression tests

`tests/board/` covers all closed bugs from `docs/qa/` as pytest regression cases. Run as part of L1 in `scripts/test-pipeline.sh --quick`.
