# The details the README used to carry

Everything here is current; it moved out of the README because a first-time
reader does not need it to decide whether to try the tool. Linked from the
README's Documentation section.

## Critics before the plan

The most expensive bugs are not in the code — they are in decisions made before
coding starts. Three critic agents run before the Plan stage, at the three
positions where a mistake costs the most:

| Critic | Catches |
|---|---|
| **Architecture critic** | coupling that rules out multi-tenancy later · "obvious" O(n²) on real-scale data · circular dependencies between bounded contexts |
| **Spec critic** | "we solved the wrong problem" — the worst class of bug, because no unit test catches it · misaligned acceptance criteria · scope that was never agreed |
| **Schema critic** | `NOT NULL` without a default on a 50M-row table · missing `CONCURRENTLY` on index creation · irreversible migrations with no rollback path |

## Jurisdiction detection

`npx great-cto init` scans three signal sources — README keywords, infra region
strings (Terraform, `.env` `AWS_REGION=`, docker-compose `TZ=`), and
`package.json` homepage TLD — and auto-detects which of **12 jurisdictions**
apply:

| Jurisdiction | Signals (README + infra) | Frameworks | Reviewer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `eu` | gdpr · eu users · nis2 · eu ai act · `eu-west-*` · `.de` TLD | GDPR · EU AI Act · NIS2 · ePrivacy | `gdpr-reviewer` |
| `us-ca` | ccpa · cpra · california residents · do not sell | CCPA / CPRA | `us-privacy-reviewer` |
| `uk` | uk gdpr · information commissioner · dpa 2018 | UK GDPR · DPA 2018 | `gdpr-reviewer` |
| `in` | dpdpa · india users · rbi data localisation | DPDPA 2023 · RBI | `dpdpa-reviewer` |
| `br` | lgpd · anpd · brazil users | LGPD | `gdpr-reviewer` |
| `au` | privacy act 1988 · oaic · notifiable data breach | Privacy Act 1988 · CDR | `us-privacy-reviewer` |
| `sg` | pdpa · pdpc · mas guidelines · singpass | PDPA · MAS TRM | `us-privacy-reviewer` |
| `ca` | pipeda · quebec law 25 · casl · `ca-central-*` | PIPEDA · Quebec Law 25 · CASL · OSFI B-10 | `us-privacy-reviewer` |
| `jp` | appi · japan users · my number · `ap-northeast-1` | APPI 2022 · PPC Guidelines · FISC | `us-privacy-reviewer` |
| `cn` | pipl · mlps · china users · `cn-north-*` | PIPL 2021 · DSL 2021 · MLPS 2.0 · CBDT | `gdpr-reviewer` |
| `kr` | pipa korea · isms-p · kisa · `ap-northeast-2` | PIPA · ISMS-P · FSC | `us-privacy-reviewer` |
| `us` | ftc · us users · virginia cdpa · texas tdpsa | FTC Act · US state privacy laws | `us-privacy-reviewer` |

Word-boundary matching prevents false positives (`india` does not match
`indiana`). The result is written to `PROJECT.md` as `jurisdiction: [eu, us-ca]`
and gates the matching reviewer on every feature. Override it there manually.

Beyond GDPR/PCI/HIPAA, reviews cover SEC cyber-disclosure (8-K Item 1.05),
CMMC 2.0 / NIST 800-171 for defense contractors, US AI governance (NIST AI RMF ·
Colorado SB 205 · Utah/Texas AI), web-tracking litigation (VPPA · CIPA ·
Washington MHMDA), and HMDA / SR 11-7 model risk for lending.

## Cost, itemised

Indicative for a solo-CTO project at ~20 pipeline runs a month:

| Pipeline | Cost/run | Runs/mo | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| quick (config / typo) | $0.10 | 10 | $1 |
| quick (new endpoint) | $1 | 6 | $6 |
| standard (feature) | $5 | 3 | $15 |
| deep (cross-cutting) | $12 | 1 | $12 |
| | | | **~$34** |

You pay your own LLM provider. No per-seat fee, no SaaS. Routine triage
auto-routes to a cheaper model (~5× lower cost) for a 60–80% reduction on
log clustering.

## The second opinion, made unavoidable

A cross-model review has shipped for a while: `scripts/lib/cross-model-review.mjs`
sends the diff to a model from another family — Codex, or OpenRouter — and writes
one line per review to `.great_cto/cross-review.log`, each carrying the `sha` of
the tree it read. It runs when somebody remembers to run it.

That is the shape this pipeline has already measured. An instruction that depends
on the model remembering held at 18%; removing the remembering took it to 92%.

So there is now a Stop hook, `scripts/hooks/cross-review-gate.mjs`, that will not
let a turn end on a diff no second model has read. It does not run the review
itself — a Stop hook holds the turn open while it works, and a Codex run is
measured in minutes. It reads the log, joins a line to the current `HEAD` by that
`sha`, and blocks with the command that clears it.

Four states, and only one of them ends the turn quietly:

| the log says | the gate does |
|---|---|
| a line joins this tree, verdict `PASS` | nothing — the turn ends |
| a line joins this tree, verdict `BLOCK` | blocks, naming the findings and the P0 count |
| no line joins this tree | blocks once: nothing has read this diff |
| lines exist, none can be joined | blocks once: they predate the join key, and are neither a pass nor a verdict |
| no second opinion is declared | nothing — declaring `none` is a decision, not an omission |

**It is off unless you turn it on:** `GREAT_CTO_CROSS_REVIEW_GATE=1`. A gate that
runs a second model at the end of every turn spends your money without being
asked, and can loop one model against the other until a rate limit stops it.
OpenAI's own Codex plugin ships the same idea and warns about exactly that. It
also blocks a given diff **once** — a hook that can refuse to end the turn
forever is a hang, not a guardrail.

Two documents govern how this product describes itself, both approved at
`gate:product` on 2026-09-07:
[BRIEF-story-rewrite-2026-09](product/BRIEF-story-rewrite-2026-09.md) — what the
landing and the README may claim, and the five claims removed because nothing in
the repository could prove them — and
[DESIGN-story-rewrite-2026-09](design/DESIGN-story-rewrite-2026-09.md), which
governs how those two surfaces look and how a figure is allowed to appear on
them. The cross-provider harness those claims are measured against is described
in [SPRINT-2-CROSS-PROVIDER](testing/SPRINT-2-CROSS-PROVIDER.md).

## CI integration

```yaml
- run: npx great-cto@latest ci ./ --sarif results.sarif
- uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  if: always()
  with: { sarif_file: results.sarif }
```

`great-cto ci` detects `$GITHUB_ACTIONS` and emits `::error file=...,line=N::`
annotations inline on PR diffs. Exit codes: 0 clean / 1 findings / 2 setup error.

## Email alerts

Five events that need you within two hours get emailed — no Resend account, no
API keys; delivery routes through `greatcto.systems/notify` (free, 100
emails/24h per verified address). Setup: board → Settings → Email alerts → verify your
email → pick triggers.

| Trigger | When |
|---|---|
| P0 incident | a P0 task opens in any project |
| Gate stale > 2h | a `gate:ship` has been waiting on you for hours |
| Security BLOCKED | `security-officer` rejected a merge |
| Budget alert | monthly LLM spend crosses 80% / 100% of budget |
| Weekly digest | Friday 09:00 — shipped, spent with its provenance, QA |

## Test pyramid

Structural + state-machine tier runs in under 2 minutes for $0
(`node --test tests/*.test.mjs`); the real-LLM tier (archetypes × 4–8 stages,
plus pack overlays and domain reviewers) runs on demand via OpenRouter for
~$5–10. Breakdown: [docs/testing/](testing/).

## Example: three products, one pipeline

Same command, different product — the build archetype shapes the stack:

| | Dispatch app | Class-booking app | Profitability dashboard |
|---|---|---|---|
| Archetype | CRUD vertical-SaaS | Booking / scheduling | Dashboard / analytics |
| Stack | Next.js · Postgres · shadcn | Next.js · Postgres · cal | Next.js · warehouse-lite · charts |
| Integrations | Auth · RBAC | Stripe · Twilio | source connectors |

The 6 pipelines: [greatcto.systems/pipelines](https://greatcto.systems/pipelines) ·
all 26 archetypes: [ARCHETYPES.md](ARCHETYPES.md).
