**Your coding agent ships code. This is what checks it.**

You write a spec. Your Claude Code builds against it, a second model from
another family reads the same diff, and where they disagree you see the
disagreement and decide. Three decisions stay yours — what gets built, how, and
whether it ships. What lands is a **repository you own** and a **URL that works**.

Seven products built this way in the open benchmark: **median $171** in tokens,
measured 2026-07-10. You pay your own LLM provider; great_cto is MIT and bills nothing.

```

Three stops is the default, not the floor. One line takes it to one:

The board at `localhost:3141` fills itself in — **Decisions** (what needs you),
**Ledger** (what it cost), **Fleet** (which agent to stop trusting), **Harness**
(who gave the second opinion, and what it actually did). Nothing on it renders
an absence as a pass: a scan that never ran is `n/a`, never a green zero.
## Numbers, measured

| | |
|---|---|
| One feature, end to end, fully traced | **1h 26m · $3.40** in tokens — [the receipts](https://greatcto.systems/proof) |
| A whole product — 7 built in the open benchmark | median **$171** in tokens · **70/100** quality (58–86), measured **2026-07-10** — [reproduce it](docs/benchmarks/BENCH-2026-07-batch1.md) |
| Typical month, 20 pipeline runs | **~$34** — you pay your own LLM provider, nothing else |
| Products it knows how to build | **60**, across 15 US industries, through [6 reusable pipelines](https://greatcto.systems/pipelines) |

The quality score is produced by running each product's own tests, not by
counting files — which is why it says 70 and not a rounder, prettier number.

## Quick start

```bash
npx great-cto init
```

Restart Claude Code, then:

```bash
/start "build a dispatch & scheduling app for an HVAC business"
```

The pipeline takes it from there. Day to day you touch three things:

| | |
|---|---|
| `/start "…"` | describe a product or feature — the pipeline runs it |
| `/inbox` | what needs you: pending gates, P0s, blocked tasks |
| `/digest` | weekly DORA metrics + cost-per-feature roll-up |

Requires Node ≥ 18.17. Companion plugins (Superpowers, Beads) install
automatically. After init, verify the host actually loaded the plugin —
`claude plugin list --json` should show no `errors` for `great-cto`.

**On OpenAI Codex** (`npx great-cto init --host codex`) you get the **skills and
the MCP server** — not the pipeline above. Codex has no plugin surface for
hooks, slash commands or role agents, so `/start`, `/inbox`, the gate chain and
`secret-scan` do not run there. That is a limit of the host, not a setting:
`hooks` in a plugin manifest is never read
([openai/codex#16430](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/16430),
[#39895](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/39895)). The installer prints
the same split before it does anything.

**Two harnesses, one review.** On Codex the pipeline does not run: what runs
there is the skills bundle and an MCP server. Codex's other job is to be the
**second opinion** — from inside Claude Code it reads the same diff, and each
review line carries the `sha` of the tree it read, so "reviewed" can be proven
about *this* diff rather than asserted. The log holds **4 lines so far, 1
carrying a sha**; no catch-rate is claimed from that, and none should be.

Since 3.26.0 Codex takes part in the pipeline as that second reviewer. Declare it once:

```yaml
# .great_cto/PROJECT.md
capabilities:
  second_opinion: codex      # or: openrouter · none
```

and on every high-stakes change the Claude `code-reviewer` and **`codex exec`**
(read-only sandbox, your Codex login, no API key) review the **same diff at the
same time**. Findings merge; a P0 from either side blocks; where they disagree,
both sets reach the human at the gate — the stricter one sets the verdict, and
nobody averages. The board's **Harness** screen detects Codex, holds the choice,
and shows beside it what the second opinion *did*: every run, including skipped
ones, from `.great_cto/cross-review.log`. Four states, and the fourth is the
point — *declared but unavailable* is never shown as *off*.

How much it helps is measured there, not asserted here. What the log holds so
far: the first real Codex review — of the commit that wired Codex in — found a
P1 that the author and the test suite had both missed; the review of the fix
found nothing. Two runs is evidence of the mechanism, not a rate. The rate is
the card's job.

## When it asks you

One setting in `.great_cto/PROJECT.md` decides where the pipeline stops:

| `approval-level` | Stops you at | Stops |
|---|---|---|
| **`ship-only`** | **the deploy — and briefs you on what gets built** | **1** |
| `product-only` | what we build · whether it ships | 2 |
| `gates-only` *(default)* | what we build · the design · the deploy | 3 |
| `strict` | the design · code review · the deploy | 3 |
| `auto` | nothing in the pipeline | 0 |

Counts are pipeline stops. Every level also carries one guard that is not a
process choice: importing data over existing records stops you at **every**
level, `auto` included, because that one destroys what was there.

**`ship-only` is the minimum that is still honest.** One stop — the deploy, the
only decision whose consequence leaves your machine. The *what gets built*
decision does not vanish, because a pipeline that spends a day on the wrong thing
is the expensive failure: it arrives as one screen in your console, printed once,
before the build starts.

```
ABOUT TO BUILD — say nothing and this proceeds, say something and it stops.

  What gets built:  the offline-first checkout; ship the queue before the UI
  Why:              reliability wins this segment, not features
  Stop if:          under 20% of orders are created offline after four weeks
  Left open:        which conflict rule for a re-submitted order

  Full brief: docs/product/BRIEF-checkout.md
```

Silence is consent, and the screen says so. If the brief cannot be read, the gate
comes back — "I could not show you" is never delivered as "you were shown and
said nothing".

`gates-only` gained the product gate in v3.0.0. It used to stop on *how* to build
and *whether* to release, and never on *what* to build — the decision that is
wrong for six stages before anyone finds out. It costs one pause per **product**,
not per feature: `product-owner` is an entry point and runs only from `/start`.

A regulated archetype — fintech, healthcare, gov — keeps its security,
compliance and ship gates **at every level, including `auto`**. A lighter level
delegates judgement; it never skips compliance. Full table: [docs/GATES.md](docs/GATES.md).

## Four things it refuses to say

The same rule, in the four places it costs something to keep: **a thing that did
not happen must never look like a thing that did.**

| When | What is easy to show | What it shows instead |
|---|---|---|
| A second opinion is declared but its harness is missing | *off* | **`unavailable`** — declared and unreachable is not a choice you made |
| A check ran and could not decide | *pass* | **`unverifiable`** — and the stage does not proceed on it |
| A run's cost was never measured | **`$0.00`** | **`unmeasured`** — and budgets do not fire on it |
| A stage was assessed by nobody | *0* | **`null`** — a pass rate divides by what was actually assessed |

Each of these is a place where the honest answer is longer, uglier, and harder to
build than the confident one. That is the whole product.

The proof is subtraction. v3.27.0 and v3.27.1 deleted this project's own
favourable numbers — "cost savings vs FTE", a spend comparison against a human
team, a projected month — because none of them could be shown to be true.

## The three doubts worth having

**“I can't trust code I didn't watch being written.”**
Neither do we, so nothing is taken on an agent's word about itself. Each stage is
checked against what it actually produced — do the named files exist, do the
frozen acceptance criteria pass when run, and only then is a separate model asked
whether each requirement is addressed. Where that check cannot tell, it returns
`unverifiable`, which is **not** a pass.

**“It will spend money while I sleep.”**
Per-agent budgets decline to dispatch past their cap and name the number. A run
whose cost could not be measured reads `unmeasured` and holds nothing — a limit
firing on a number nobody measured is worse than no limit, and a confident
`$0.00` for unmeasured work is how a spend goes unnoticed.

**“And then I'm locked in.”**
One command to install, MIT, running on your machine against your own LLM
account. Delete great_cto and the repository it built is still yours — ordinary
Next.js, Postgres and Stripe that any engineer can pick up.

## What makes it different

- **Specialists, not a generalist** — 70 agents with narrow jobs and their own
  review gates, instead of one assistant that types faster than it thinks.
  [The roster →](docs/reference/agents.md)
- **Critics before code** — architecture, spec, and schema critics run before
  planning, where a mistake still costs hours instead of days.
- **Scope enforced at write time** — an agent physically cannot touch files
  outside its brief. Not flagged at review; refused at write.
- **QA that distrusts itself** — critical paths written as Gherkin before test
  code, then mutation testing asks whether the suite would catch anything at all.
- **Memory across sessions** — decisions, lessons, and promoted patterns persist
  per project and globally; an interrupted run resumes knowing which stages ran.
- **Cost you can see** — per-agent spend, estimate-vs-actual drift, and
  cost-per-accepted-change on the board, not in a spreadsheet.
- **Spending caps that refuse** — `agent-budgets:` in PROJECT.md caps what a
  stage may spend; the pipeline declines to dispatch past it and names the
  number. An estimate never refuses — see the table above.
- **A stage is checked before the next builds on it** — files named by the
  verdict must exist, frozen `## ACCEPTANCE` criteria must pass when run, and
  only then is a second model asked whether each requirement is addressed.
  Cheapest question first, and three answers rather than two: `verified`,
  `rework`, or `unverifiable`. An agent that claims nothing and freezes no
  criteria is reported — otherwise the cheapest way to pass is claiming nothing.
- **Work goes back, and the return has a ceiling** — a failed stage returns
  `REWORK` with the findings quoted and the same agent fixes it; `BLOCKED` means
  a human must decide. After three passes it becomes the human's problem, because
  two machines handing work back and forth do not get bored.
- **Quality kept apart from what happened** — the verdict says what a run did, a
  *score* says how well, in its own append-only store by a different actor at a
  different time. Scorers may disagree, and every score names who made it.
- **Silence is recorded** — the dispatcher writes what it decided to
  `.great_cto/pipeline-runs.jsonl`, *including when it decided nothing* and why.
  Every pipeline defect found this year hid in the gap between "nothing should
  happen" and "nothing could happen".

Everything runs locally, MIT-licensed, on your own keys. Your code stays on your
machine; prompts go to your LLM provider and nowhere else. Telemetry is
**off by default** ([docs/PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md)).

## Limitations

- **Not a hosted app builder** — it does not replace your coding agent; without
  one there is nothing for it to orchestrate.
- **For one builder** — a solo founder or CTO. Two or more engineers sharing the
  pipeline have outgrown it.
- **Not a CI/CD system** — gates run locally; you still merge through GitHub Actions.
- **Not certification-audited** — PCI/HIPAA/SOC2 scaffolds are starting points,
  not certifications.
- **Not deterministic** — LLM output. Gate verdicts deserve a sanity check.
- **Spend is measured, attribution is not yet per-agent** — cost is read from
  the host's own session transcript rather than from an agent's self-report, so
  the tokens are real. But the transcript the hook is handed covers the session,
  not one subagent, so a run's cost can be attributed to whichever stage finished
  last — inflated by orders of magnitude. Treat per-agent figures as a ceiling
  until this is fixed. A stage with no measurement at all still shows
  `unmeasured` rather than a confident `$0.00`, and budgets do not fire for it.
