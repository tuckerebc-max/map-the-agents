The official OSpec CLI package is `@clawplays/ospec-cli`, and the official command is `ospec`. OSpec is a spec-driven, agentic workflow framework for AI coding agents — it brings spec-driven development (SDD) and Loop Engineering (a verifiable plan → act → verify goal loop) to Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, MCP-based agents, and plain CLI workflows.

## Why OSpec?

AI coding assistants are powerful, but requirements that live only in chat history are hard to inspect, review, and close out cleanly. OSpec adds a lightweight workflow layer so the repository can hold the change context before code is written and after the work ships.

- **Spec-driven work, saved to your repo** — OSpec turns a request into files (proposal, design, plan, tasks, reviews, verification evidence) that live in your repo instead of in chat history, so any assistant (Codex/GPT, Claude Code, Gemini, OpenCode, or plain CLI) can pick up exactly where the last one stopped.
- **`ospec change` — the everyday fast flow** — one requirement becomes one active change on a short `init -> change -> verify/finalize` path, kept lightweight and easy to review.
- **`ospec goal` for larger or riskier work** — describe the result you need; the AI asks important questions, writes an inspectable plan, implements the work, runs tests, requests an independent review, updates project docs, and continues until the result is proven.
- **One predictable Goal workflow** — every Goal uses the same fast quality path, pauses for material user decisions, and saves progress in the repository so a later session can resume it.

## Install With npm

```bash
npm install -g @clawplays/ospec-cli
```

Official package: `@clawplays/ospec-cli`  
Command: `ospec`  
Verify install: `ospec --help`

## Quick Start

OSpec only takes 3 steps:

1. initialize OSpec in your project directory
2. create and advance one change for a requirement, document update, or bug fix
3. archive the accepted change after deployment and validation are complete

### 1. Initialize OSpec In Your Project Directory

Recommended prompt:

```text
OSpec, initialize this project.
```

Claude / Codex skill mode:

```text
/ospec initialize this project.
```

<details>
<summary>Command line</summary>

```bash
ospec init .
ospec init . --summary "Internal admin portal for operations"
ospec init . --summary "Internal admin portal for operations" --tech-stack node,react,postgres
ospec init . --architecture "Single web app with API and shared auth" --document-language en-US
```

CLI notes:

- `--summary`: project overview text written into the generated docs
- `--tech-stack`: comma-separated stack list such as `node,react,postgres`
- `--architecture`: short architecture description
- `--document-language`: generated doc language, choose from `en-US`, `zh-CN`, `ja-JP`, or `ar`
- AI-first language resolution order: explicit language request in the conversation -> current conversation language -> persisted project language in `.skillrc`
- CLI language resolution order: explicit `--document-language` -> persisted project language in `.skillrc` -> existing project docs / managed `for-ai/*` guidance / asset manifest -> fallback `en-US`
- OSpec persists the chosen project document language in `.skillrc` and reuses it for `for-ai` guidance, `ospec change`, and `ospec update`
- new projects initialized by `ospec init` default to the nested layout: root `.skillrc` and `README.md`, with OSpec-managed files under `.ospec/`
- plain init does not create optional knowledge maps such as `.ospec/knowledge/src/` or `.ospec/knowledge/tests/`; those appear only when a project already has legacy knowledge content to migrate or when future explicit knowledge-generation flows create them
- CLI commands still accept shorthand like `changes/active/<change-name>`, but the physical path in nested projects is `.ospec/changes/active/<change-name>`
- if you pass these values, OSpec uses them directly when generating project docs
- if you do not pass them, OSpec reuses existing docs when possible and otherwise creates placeholder docs first

</details>

### 2. Create And Advance A Change

Use this for requirement delivery, documentation updates, refactors, and bug fixes.

Recommended prompt:

```text
OSpec, create and advance a change for this requirement.
```

Claude / Codex skill mode:

```text
/ospec-change create and advance a change for this requirement.
/ospec-goal create and advance a full goal for this requirement.
```

<details>
<summary>Command line</summary>

```bash
ospec change docs-homepage-refresh .
ospec change fix-login-timeout .
ospec change update-billing-copy .
```

</details>

### Agent Execution (Goal Workflow)

The classic change flow above stays simple: `proposal.md` → `tasks.md` → implement → `verification.md` → `review.md`, with no controller layer. The agent controller layer — parallel worker dispatch, reviewer gates, and durable evidence — belongs to the full goal workflow. Use it with `ospec goal`, or on a single change only when you explicitly opt into agent/worker execution. OSpec keeps the controller state in repo artifacts, and the current AI harness starts native worker agents when available.

```bash
ospec session .
ospec execute bootstrap changes/active/<goal-name>
ospec execute workspace changes/active/<goal-name>
ospec execute status changes/active/<goal-name>
ospec execute dispatch changes/active/<goal-name> --limit 3
ospec execute launch changes/active/<goal-name> --task <task-id> --target codex
ospec execute complete <task-id> changes/active/<goal-name> --status DONE --summary "..."
ospec loop tick changes/active/<goal-name> # issues task/final reviews with executor provenance
ospec execute verify changes/active/<goal-name> --command "npm test" --status PASSED --exit-code 0
```

`launch` writes `artifacts/agents/launch-plan.md`; it does not start workers by itself. Codex/GPT use `spawn_agent` plus bounded `wait_agent`, Claude Code uses bounded background Task polling when available, Gemini uses `@generalist`, and OpenCode uses `@mention`. Every native adapter returns from one wait within 60 seconds, refreshes heartbeats, persists each completed child immediately, and re-ticks. The 60-second boundary limits one controller poll, not the AI task runtime: a live child continues across polls up to its configurable absolute action deadline. OSpec never starts Orca, Codex, Claude, or another agent CLI as a fallback. If the current model harness cannot provide native subagents, executable dispatch blocks until a supported harness reports a fresh capability.

For a controller-owned Goal, task and final reviews are always issued by `ospec loop tick` so the dispatch is atomically bound to the real reviewer executor. Use `ospec execute review` directly only in a non-controller workflow.

### 3. Archive After Acceptance

After the requirement has passed deployment, testing, QA, or other acceptance checks, archive the validated change.

Recommended prompt:

```text
OSpec, archive this accepted change.
```

Claude / Codex skill mode:

```text
/ospec archive this accepted change.
```

<details>
<summary>Command line</summary>

```bash
ospec verify changes/active/<change-name>
ospec finalize changes/active/<change-name>
```

Explicit incomplete archive, only after the user accepts the unresolved risk:

```bash
ospec finalize changes/active/<change-name> --force-archive --confirm-force-archive <exact-change-name> --reason "Accepted unresolved verification risk"
```

Archive notes:

- run your project-specific deploy, test, and QA flow first
- use `ospec verify` to confirm the active change is ready
- use `ospec finalize` to rebuild indexes and archive the accepted change
- force archive is never automatic: it requires the force flag, an exact change-name confirmation, and an audit reason; it refuses any missing, `issued`, or `running` Loop item, but may preserve an unconsumed pointer whose items are all terminal; the archive is marked `forced`, `incomplete`, and `accepted-risk` instead of completed
- new nested projects archive under `.ospec/changes/archived/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD/<change-name>`; CLI shorthand under `changes/archived/...` still works
- existing flat archives are reorganized by `ospec update`

</details>

### Goal: Use It For Work That Needs More Care

Use a Goal only when you choose the full workflow. A user-selected Change remains a Change regardless of complexity, file count, risk, or batch size; create it with `ospec change` (`ospec new` remains an alias).

A Change uses compact stage-aware guidance, one lightweight current-AI review, and derived closeout state. When verification, documentation, and review gates pass, `APPROVED` or `APPROVED_WITH_CONCERNS` may finalize and archive automatically; explicit batches stay sequential in the queue.

Start from a terminal:

```bash
ospec goal improve-checkout --target codex --execution-model controller --harness-interactive true --native-subagents supported
```

Then tell the AI what outcome you need in ordinary language. You can also skip the terminal command and say: "Use OSpec goal for this requirement and carry it through to completion."

That is all a normal user needs to operate. The AI will:

1. Ask only the choices that materially change the result.
2. Write the proposal, design, and implementation plan, then run deterministic design and plan preflights without launching reviewer children.
3. Derive the task graph and run one independent combined planning review across requirements, architecture, task boundaries, dependencies, and verification coverage.
4. If that review finds issues, repair the planning set once as a group and run one fresh combined planning review. A repeated failure stops instead of looping.
5. Run conflict-safe implementation workers, independent task reviews, an integration-focused final review, verification, documentation sync, and archive.

You remain in control. The AI explains what it is about to do, pauses when it needs a decision, and records task, review, repair, verification, and loop progress in the repository so a fresh worker or later session can continue without replaying the conversation. You do not need to run the internal `ospec execute` commands yourself.

Every Goal uses the same fast quality workflow. Required user decisions always block implementation. The integrated goal loop reads `task-graph.json`, emits a bounded conflict-safe parallel batch, and explains whether configured limits, graph conflicts, token funding, an optional configured allowlist, or known harness capacity reduced it. Unknown native capacity uses an implementation fallback of three; a larger positive session-bound capacity can support configured batches such as 5-10 when the graph, shared resources, token budget, and `maxParallel` allow. The current IDE AI launches one fresh native subagent per referenced packet, polls with bounded waits, refreshes heartbeats, persists each finished result immediately, and continues ticking without another user prompt. If the IDE lacks native subagents, controller dispatch fails clearly.

To see progress, child executor ids, heartbeat due times, leases, token sources, and concurrency reasons, run `ospec loop status --brief`; controller agents should use `ospec loop run --once --compact-json` to avoid repeating large runtime-adapter objects. Use `ospec loop configure` for concurrency, budgets, action runtime limits, evidence-result grace, and optional allowlists. IDE controllers persist child ownership with `ospec loop heartbeat` and atomically commit successful evidence plus executor outcome with `ospec loop finalize`. After a confirmed session or child loss, `ospec loop recover --force` expires only unfinished items. Task and final repair convergence guards prevent repeated finding sets from cycling indefinitely. Durable worker blockers are not redispatched, technical executor failures remain retryable, and independent ready tasks run first. Advanced loop and triage commands are documented in [docs/loop-engineering.md](docs/loop-engineering.md).

Internally, OSpec validates design and implementation-plan readiness inline before task graph derivation, keeps implementation and code review separate, feeds blocked work and review findings into transactional retry or grouped repair, and requires current test evidence before the goal is considered complete.

Claude Code hard enforcement (one-time; the AI runs this for you automatically in a Claude Code harness):

```bash
ospec session hook --target claude --apply
```

This writes a hook bundle under `.ospec/hooks/claude/` and merges it into `.claude/settings.json` (idempotent and reversible). The hooks:

- announce every subagent dispatch and every `ospec` command at the tool level,
- hard-block subagent dispatch while a required decision is still pending,
- inject the static Announce-Before-Act / Brainstorm-First contract only on startup, clear, or compact, while prompt submission stays silent unless a required decision is pending.

Hooks load at session start, so they take effect from the next Claude Code session.

## Update With npm

For an existing OSpec project, after upgrading the CLI with npm, run this in the project directory to refresh the project's OSpec files:

```bash
ospec update
```

`ospec update` also migrates legacy root-level `build-index-auto.cjs` / `build-index-auto.js` tooling into `.ospec/tools/build-index-auto.cjs` and refreshes OSpec-managed hook entrypoints to use the new location.
It also repairs older OSpec projects that still have an OSpec footprint but are missing newer core runtime directories, and refreshes managed skills and archive layout metadata.
For nested projects that still carry legacy knowledge under `.ospec/src/` or `.ospec/tests/`, `ospec update` migrates those paths into `.ospec/knowledge/src/` and `.ospec/knowledge/tests/`.
It does not upgrade the CLI itself, and it does not migrate active / queued changes automatically.
It also does not switch a classic project layout to nested automatically.
If you want to convert an older classic project to the new layout, run `ospec layout migrate --to nested` explicitly.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Protocol Shell** | The minimum collaboration skeleton: root `.skillrc` and `README.md`, plus managed OSpec files under `.ospec/` for change state, SKILL docs, index state, `for-ai/` guidance, and project docs. |
| **Project Knowledge Layer** | Explicit project context such as `docs/project/*`, layered skill files, and index state that AI can read consistently. |
| **Active Change** | A dedicated execution container for one small or routine requirement, using the classic fast files: `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `state.json`, `verification.md`, and `review.md`. |
| **Active Goal** | A full-workflow execution container created with `ospec goal`, adding `design.md`, `implementation-plan.md`, `artifacts/agents/task-graph.json`, handoff artifacts, document-review artifacts, launch-plan artifacts, worker-run artifacts, reviewer-run artifacts, retry artifacts, review artifacts, `artifacts/agents/worker-status.md`, and evidence artifacts. |

## Features

- **Change-ready initialization**: `ospec init` creates the protocol shell and baseline project knowledge docs in one pass.
- **Guided initialization**: AI-assisted init can ask once for missing summary or tech stack; direct CLI init falls back to placeholder docs when context is missing.
- **Stable project language**: the chosen document language is stored in `.skillrc` so later guidance and generated change docs stay consistent unless you explicitly change it.
- **Living feature docs with a locator**: feature sections in human-owned docs declare `<!-- ospec:feature <slug> code:<paths> -->`; `docs/project/feature-catalog.md` carries one row per declared feature — slug, one line, `doc#section`, status, last-change archive — and `ospec docs locate --feature <slug>` or `--affects <path>` returns that one section's location and line range so an agent reads one section instead of a document.
- **Archived changes render on demand**: archiving writes the change's index entry (with its features and documentation updates), refreshes the affected catalogue rows, and replaces the section's `ospec:last-change` traceability comment idempotently — the engine's only write into a human-owned document, and a comment failure warns instead of blocking. Nothing is generated under `docs/project/changes/`; `ospec changes show <archive>` renders the summary, affects, file list, and verification commands from the index and the archive directory. Goals still update the relevant human-maintained architecture, API, module, or operational docs.
- **Documentation obligations**: at planning time `ospec docs obligations --apply` derives this change's obligations from its `change_type` and features (falling back to `affects` resolution through the `code:` declarations) with the resolved `path#section` already filled in — a fix checks the section for the pre-fix wrong behaviour, a refactor verifies it and may record `verified_unchanged` with `ospec docs confirm`. `.skillrc` `docs_contract.mode: warn|strict` decides whether an unmet required obligation warns or blocks archiving. `ospec docs audit` lists feature sections whose `code:` paths changed since their last recorded change, and `ospec docs migrate` converts legacy generated documents into feature docs through four gated phases.
- **Scoped review evidence and cost metrics**: task and final review dispatches write `artifacts/agents/review-packages/*.diff` with scoped Git evidence, while `artifacts/agents/execution-metrics.json` records packet/report/package bytes and task duration. Goal task graphs can enable `documentation_updates` so missing or undeclared project docs block archive.
- **Tracked requirement execution**: small changes keep proposal, tasks, state, verification, and review files aligned; full goals also keep design, implementation plan, task graph, handoff, review, worker status, and evidence artifacts aligned.
- **Goal experience contracts**: every goal runs with `Announce-Before-Act` (the AI announces its skill and stage, the `ospec execute …` command and the artifact it writes, and each subagent dispatch), `Brainstorm-First` (open direction, architecture, API, UI, risk, and scope decisions are asked one at a time through the native question UI before design is locked), and `Zero-Setup` (you only start a goal and describe the requirement — the AI runs every `ospec` command itself). In Claude Code, `ospec session hook --target claude --apply` adds hooks that announce every dispatch and hard-block subagent dispatch while a required decision is still pending.
- **Optional pre-change aids**: `ospec brainstorm` writes durable exploration artifacts under `.ospec/brainstorms/`, with an optional static visual companion; `ospec plan` writes plan drafts under `.ospec/plans/` and only updates `implementation-plan.md` when `--apply` is passed. The Change flow starts with `ospec change` (`ospec new` is an alias); the Goal flow starts with `ospec goal` only when selected by the user.
- **Session brief and hooks**: `ospec session` writes `.ospec/session-brief.json` and `.ospec/session-brief.md` so agents or humans entering an existing project can see active changes, queued changes, queue-run state, indexed document and archived-feature counts, a cache fingerprint, and the next safe command before touching a change; `ospec session hook --target claude` writes opt-in harness startup artifacts plus a Claude Code hook bundle under `.ospec/hooks/`, and `--apply` idempotently merges it into `.claude/settings.json`.
- **Integrated goal loop**: `ospec loop run --once` (or `ospec loop tick`) emits token-bounded planning, task, review, and verification actions for fresh model-native subagents. It uses packet paths instead of duplicating the whole goal, persists pending actions, and stops repeated repair findings instead of cycling. Optional configured allowlists add an explicit path and command boundary without creating another workflow level.
- **Task graph controller**: `ospec execute bootstrap` writes a one-change startup/resume snapshot; `preflight` records deterministic design and implementation-plan evidence under `artifacts/agents/planning-preflights/`; `workspace` records git safety; `dispatch`, `launch`, `complete`, and `review` settle native-subagent packets; `debug`, `tdd`, and `verify` record durable evidence; `sync` rebuilds derived status.
- **Fast planning quality**: deterministic preflights cost no model round trip, while one independent combined planning reviewer checks requirement, architecture, task-graph, dependency, and verification semantics. A `NEEDS_CHANGES` decision permits one grouped planning repair and at most one delta-scoped re-review; a repair executor failure with no planning edits re-arms instead of consuming the allowance, and all-medium-or-lower findings settle deterministically as `APPROVED_WITH_CONCERNS` after the repair. Planning approvals are invalidated only by semantic planning changes, never by execution progress; repeated semantic failure is a stable blocker.
- **Measured execution and grouped repair**: command runners can write authoritative usage to `OSPEC_USAGE_FILE` for automatic ingestion, while `--usage-file` remains a manual input. Metrics distinguish complete, partial, and missing coverage. `ospec execute repair` turns all structured `NEEDS_CHANGES` findings into one repair task.
- **Verified durable documentation**: declared documentation targets capture before/after normalized content hashes, so an unchanged file cannot satisfy a new run. The feature catalogue links completed work directly to the durable project documents it updated.
- **Queue helpers**: `queue` and `run` support explicit multi-change execution when one active change is not enough.
- **Skill management**: install and inspect OSpec skills for Codex and Claude Code.
- **Standard closeout**: `finalize` verifies and archives the change, then refreshes the feature catalogue and knowledge index before manual Git commit. It never overwrites human-maintained architecture, module, or API prose.
