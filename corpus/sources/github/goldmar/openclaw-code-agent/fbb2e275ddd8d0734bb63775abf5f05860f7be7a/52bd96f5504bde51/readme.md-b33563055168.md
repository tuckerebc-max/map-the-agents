`openclaw-code-agent` runs Claude Code, Codex, and experimental OpenCode as managed background coding sessions from OpenClaw chat. It adds plan approval, session lifecycle, wake routing, worktree isolation, merge/PR follow-through, and explicit goal loops on top of the agent backends.

Use it when you want to start coding work from Telegram, Discord, or another OpenClaw-supported channel and keep the job observable after the first message.

## Highlights

- **Plan -> Review -> Execute**. `plan` is the default launch mode, and plan approval defaults to `delegate` so the orchestrator reviews the full plan before approving or escalating to the user.
- **Delegated worktree isolation**. New sessions default to `delegate`; opt into `ask`, `off`, `manual`, `auto-merge`, or `auto-pr` when you want a different branch follow-through policy.
- **State-driven decision UX**. `ask` sends explicit action buttons for **Merge**, **Open PR**, **Later**, and **Discard**. The same action-token model backs Telegram and Discord interactive callbacks.
- **Lifecycle-first cleanup**. Worktrees are temporary task sandboxes. The plugin distinguishes `merged` from `released` so different-SHA branches whose content already landed on the base branch can still be cleaned safely.
- **Routed outcome summaries**. Merge and PR actions deliver the canonical status first, then wake the orchestrator to send one concise factual follow-up in the originating chat/thread.
- **Full session lifecycle**. Suspend, resume, fork, interrupt, and recover sessions across restarts with persisted metadata and output.
- **Explicit goal-task loops**. Opt into verifier-driven repair loops or Ralph-style completion loops when you need iterative autonomous execution toward a specific goal.
- **Real operator visibility**. `agent_sessions`, `agent_output`, and `agent_stats` show status, buffered output, duration, and USD cost.
- **Multiple harnesses, one control plane**. Claude Code, Codex, and experimental OpenCode share the same tools, routing, notification pipeline, and worktree strategy model while each backend uses its own adapter and resume substrate.
- **One continuation path**. Follow-ups, approvals, revisions, interrupts, and redirects all continue the existing session instead of launching a duplicate.

This plugin is separate from OpenClaw's bundled `acpx` runtime plugin and bundled core `codex` plugin. Those own adjacent OpenClaw runtime/provider surfaces; `openclaw-code-agent` owns chat orchestration and repository follow-through for its own Claude Code, Codex, and experimental OpenCode harnesses. See [docs/ACP-COMPARISON.md](docs/ACP-COMPARISON.md) for the boundary details.

## From Chat To Resolved Work

1. Ask OpenClaw to launch a coding session from chat.
2. Choose the review style you want: direct execution, user plan approval, delegated review, or explicit worktree decisions.
3. Let the agent finish in an isolated worktree when branch follow-through is enabled.
4. Merge into the base branch, open a PR, defer the decision, or discard the sandbox from the same thread.

### Direct Completion

For small trusted changes, an orchestrator can launch a session, let the selected harness finish, and report the verified outcome back to chat. The session stays observable through launch, completion, cost, duration, and commit summary.

### Plan Review

The default review loop is plan-first. Claude Code, Codex, and experimental OpenCode feed the same approval UX: the plugin blocks implementation until approval, then continues the same session after the plan is approved. Codex can provide structured plan artifacts; OpenCode is currently treated as text-only with plugin-owned plan gating. The user can approve, request a revision, or reject the plan from the originating thread.

### Worktree Decisions

In `ask`, the user controls branch follow-through after the agent finishes. Current buttons adapt to state: new branches can show **Merge**, **Open PR**, **Later**, and **Discard**; branches with an existing PR can show **View PR** and **Sync PR** instead of **Open PR**.

### Delegated Worktrees

In `delegate`, the orchestrator reviews the completed worktree and attempts the merge follow-through when the change is clean. The agent edits files in the managed worktree so the main checkout is not touched during implementation; after review, delegated follow-through merges the finished branch back to the base branch unless a conflict, error, or explicit policy requires escalation.

After merge or PR follow-through, the plugin sends the canonical status line and wakes the orchestrator to read the full session output and send the routed factual summary. That summary is orchestrator-owned, so it preserves the original chat/thread instead of depending on whichever route handled the tool call.

### Worktree Lifecycle

Worktree-backed sessions move through product-facing lifecycle states:

- `active`: sandbox still in use
- `pending decision`: waiting for merge, PR, later, or discard follow-through
- `pr_open`: PR exists and the sandbox is being preserved
- `merged`: branch landed by normal git ancestry
- `released`: content is already on the base branch after rebase, squash, or cherry-pick
- `dismissed`: user intentionally discarded the sandbox
- `no_change`: session finished without a committed delta

Use `agent_worktree_status` for current state and `agent_worktree_cleanup(mode="preview_safe")` before removing resolved sandboxes.

## Quick Start

Install and enable the plugin:

```bash
openclaw plugins install openclaw-code-agent
openclaw plugins enable openclaw-code-agent
openclaw gateway restart
openclaw plugins inspect openclaw-code-agent --runtime --json
```

OpenClaw 2026.7.1 no longer performs built-in dangerous-code blocking during
plugin installation. Review the subprocess rationale in
[docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) before installing this plugin because it
launches local coding harnesses and git tooling. Operators who require a local
allow/block decision should configure OpenClaw's `security.installPolicy`.
To replace an existing reviewed installation and pin the resolved version, use:

```bash
openclaw plugins install openclaw-code-agent --force --pin
```

Use `--force` only for a package/source you already trust. When validating a
specific reviewed release, add its version after the package name.

Add the smallest useful config under `plugins.entries["openclaw-code-agent"]` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-code-agent": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "defaultWorkdir": "/home/user/project",
          "defaultHarness": "claude-code"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For the first run, choose:

- `defaultWorkdir`: a git repository root you expect to use often.
- `defaultHarness`: `claude-code`, `codex`, or `opencode`. Treat `opencode` as experimental.

The default policy is intentionally review-first:

- `permissionMode: "plan"`
- `planApproval: "delegate"`
- `defaultWorktreeStrategy: "delegate"`

Because worktree isolation defaults to `delegate`, `defaultWorkdir` should normally be a git repo. For non-git directories, set `defaultWorktreeStrategy` to `off` or launch with `worktree_strategy: "off"`.

Chat-launched sessions route updates back to their originating chat thread. For agent-launched tool sessions without an origin route, configure `fallbackChannel` or `agentChannels` in the reference guide.

The current package requires, is built against, and is validated against OpenClaw `2026.9.4`, and therefore requires Node `>=24.16.0 <25 || >=26.1.0`; its plugin API, Gateway, and peer dependency contracts retain the verified `2026.8.1` compatibility floor. The manifest still declares `contracts.tools`, the plugin still imports only `openclaw/plugin-sdk/plugin-entry`, and its session store, wake routing, callbacks, worktree flows, and Codex/Claude model restrictions remain plugin-owned. OpenClaw's host-side model catalog and activatable-harness checks do not rewrite Code Agent's unprefixed Codex harness models (`gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna`), its Claude Code aliases (`sonnet` and `opus`), or either harness-scoped allowlist. Existing sessions, permissions, Telegram/topic routes, automation delivery context, callback ownership, and namespaced tool allowlists remain under the same plugin contracts; disabled bundled plugins are not implicitly enabled. OpenClaw `2026.9.4` unifies plugin discovery and settings, refines plugin-tool allowlisting, and improves cron/session delivery context and Telegram approvals; these host-side changes do not transfer ownership of Code Agent's routing or follow-through state. Installing this package performs no host-side configuration migration. See [SDK readiness and migration guidance](docs/REFERENCE.md#openclaw-202694-sdk-readiness) for operator guidance.

If you use Codex, make sure the local `codex` command or `OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_COMMAND` override is available and authenticated. GPT-6 Astra is the default Codex model; GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna remain supported explicit overrides. Codex-specific defaults live under `harnesses.codex`: `reasoningEffort` is sent as `reasoningEffort`, and `fastMode: true` sends `service_tier: "fast"` on Codex App Server thread, resume, and turn payloads. The Codex harness starts the app server with stdio listener args by default, only sends UUID-shaped backend thread IDs to `thread/resume`, and reports startup timeouts with redacted recent stderr. When Codex auth is inconsistent, this is the recommended `~/.codex/config.toml` setting:

```toml
forced_login_method = "chatgpt"
```

For Codex sessions authenticated with an OpenAI API key, the plugin estimates token charges from the App Server's per-response usage and shows the cumulative amount in session listings and `agent_stats`. ChatGPT OAuth/subscription sessions remain `$0` because they are quota-backed rather than pay-as-you-go API calls. The estimator covers the built-in GPT-6 Astra and GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna models, including cached input, cache writes, Fast mode, and long-context rates; unknown models remain unpriced. Reasoning tokens are already included in App Server `outputTokens` and are not added a second time.

If you use experimental OpenCode, make sure local `opencode >= 1.16.2` is available and configured with provider auth. The plugin starts `opencode serve` per session on localhost and uses OpenCode's classic session lifecycle routes while v2 session wait remains unavailable. Leave `harnesses.opencode.defaultModel` unset to let OpenCode choose its configured provider default, or pass an explicit `provider/model` string for a launch.

## First Session

In chat, ask OpenClaw to start work. The plugin ships with `oca` as a built-in short name, so no local alias config is needed for these launch phrases:

```text
Let oca do the auth middleware bug fix.
Ask oca to add tests for the billing flow.
Have oca handle the failing dashboard smoke test.
```

You can also ask without the short name:

```text
Start a coding session named fix-auth to fix the auth middleware bug.
```

When the plan arrives, respond in the same thread:

```text
Approve.
```

Send follow-ups as ordinary chat replies:

```text
Add unit tests too.
Show me the latest output.
Stop this session.
```

## Core Workflows

### Plan Review

By default, Claude Code, Codex, and experimental OpenCode produce a plan before implementation. The plan can be approved, revised, or rejected through buttons when available, or with plain-text `Approve`, `Revise`, or `Reject` in the same thread.

Revisions stay attached to the same session, so the newest plan is the actionable one.

### Worktree Follow-Through

New sessions use delegated worktree follow-through unless configured otherwise. That keeps changes in an isolated branch and wakes the orchestrator with diff context. In `ask` mode, user-facing buttons depend on state:

| State | Buttons |
| --- | --- |
| New branch and GitHub CLI available | `Merge`, `Open PR`, `Later`, `Discard` |
| Existing PR | `Merge`, `View PR`, `Sync PR`, `Later`, `Discard` |
| GitHub CLI unavailable | `Merge`, `Later`, `Discard` |

Ask OpenClaw for worktree status before cleaning resolved sandboxes.

Merge, PR, ordinary terminal, and no-change worktree outcomes use a two-step completion contract: the plugin delivers the canonical terse status, then wakes the orchestrator with the original route/thread metadata and `completionWakeSummaryRequired=true`. The orchestrator must read the full output, treat any final summary inside `agent_output` as source material rather than visible delivery, avoid repeating the status line, and send at most one short factual summary to the session origin route for the terminal/worktree outcome.

### Goal Tasks

Goal tasks are explicit autonomous loops for work that should keep iterating toward a defined finish line. They do not replace ordinary coding sessions.
Session notification headings include a concise `| reasoning: medium` field when OCA knows the selected harness/model supports the session's reasoning setting. `agent_launch(reasoning_effort="high")` overrides the harness default for that launch; resume and fork retain the saved setting unless overridden. Launch, approval/progress, terminal and later worktree notifications use that session setting even after a Gateway restart or default change. Unknown historical settings and unsupported models/harnesses (including OpenCode, which does not forward this option) omit the field. OCA does not infer a backend default or a silently downgraded Claude effort level.

Goal iteration progress is controller progress: the counter advances only when the goal controller starts another agent turn after a missing completion promise or failed verifier. If the agent performs several review/implementation passes inside one successful turn, those internal passes should appear in the single completion summary rather than as separate goal iteration notifications.

Ask in normal chat:

```text
Start a verifier goal in /repo: fix the failing auth flow and keep running pnpm test until it passes.
Start a Ralph-style goal for /repo: ship the draft workflow, and consider it complete when the output says DONE.
Show goal status.
Change the auth goal to also update the smoke tests.
Stop the auth goal.
```

OpenClaw agents can use the goal tools directly when they need explicit loop control; humans can usually describe the goal in plain language.

## Tools And Commands

Most users interact in chat. The tool surface is for OpenClaw agents and advanced integrations.

| Agent-facing tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `agent_launch` | Start a background coding session |
| `agent_respond` | Reply, redirect, approve a plan, or escalate permissions |
| `agent_request_plan_approval` | Escalate a delegated plan review to the user |
| `agent_send_plan_offer` | Send a message with Start Plan / Dismiss buttons for a plan-gated follow-up |
| `agent_output` | Read buffered session output |
| `agent_sessions` | List active and recent sessions |
| `agent_kill` | Stop or mark a session completed |
| `agent_stats` | Show aggregate usage and cost |
| `agent_merge` | Merge a worktree branch back to base |
| `agent_pr` | Create or update a GitHub PR |
| `agent_worktree_status` | Show worktree lifecycle state and cleanup safety |
| `agent_worktree_cleanup` | Clean safe worktrees or dismiss one pending decision |
| `agent_goal_launch` | Start an explicit verifier or Ralph-style goal loop |
| `agent_goal_status` | Show one goal task or list all goal tasks |
| `agent_goal_edit` | Change the goal text for an active goal task |
| `agent_goal_stop` | Stop a running goal task |

Chat commands mirror the common workflows when you want explicit commands instead of natural-language chat, but most human use should start with plain requests like the examples above. Available commands are `/agent`, `/agent_sessions`, `/agent_output`, `/agent_respond`, `/agent_kill`, `/agent_stats`, `/agent_policy`, `/agent_goal`, `/agent_goal_status`, `/agent_goal_edit`, and `/agent_goal_stop`.
