_Run, supervise, and resume AI coding work without leaving the terminal._

Forge is an open-source terminal coding environment for engineering with AI
agents. It combines agent conversations, a file explorer, Vim-style editing,
an interactive shell, diffs, approvals, model selection, and multiple durable
sessions in one keyboard-driven TUI.

Managed sessions keep their own durable state and isolated Git worktree, so one
session can keep working while you inspect, edit, or direct another. Agent shell
commands run under an OS sandbox, with network egress controlled by explicit
host rules.

Forge is alpha software. Review every approval prompt and use it first in a
disposable or backed-up repository.

## Why this exists

Most terminal coding agents optimize the prompt-to-patch loop. Real engineering
work is wider than that: you inspect code, edit some parts yourself, delegate
others, run commands, review diffs, verify behavior, switch tasks, and come back
later.

Forge keeps that whole loop in one workspace. The agent is part of the
environment rather than the entire environment: you can work directly in the
editor and shell, supervise long-running agent work, switch between independent
sessions, and resume durable state after an interruption.

## What Forge does

- Runs multiple independent coding sessions in one TUI; managed sessions use
  isolated linked Git worktrees and session-local state.
- Chats with configured models, reads and edits files, searches code, works
  with Git, and runs tools until the task completes or you interrupt it.
- Gives you a built-in file explorer, Vim-style editor, interactive shell,
  diffs, diagnostics, activity, and task state.
- Runs agent shell commands inside an OS sandbox confined to the workspace,
  with network egress denied by default and opened through explicit host rules.
- Preserves transcripts, task state, queued follow-ups, and unfinished work in
  a local SQLite journal so sessions can survive process restarts.
- Supports provider sign-in, per-session model selection, reasoning effort, and
  model switching from the TUI.
- Connects configured MCP servers and exposes their tools to the agent.
- Supports child agents with durable state and isolated worktrees for delegated
  work.

## Install

### Install a prebuilt release

On macOS or Linux:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NorviaLabs/forge/main/install/forge-installer.sh | sh
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NorviaLabs/forge/main/install/forge-installer.ps1 | iex
```

The installers select the current release for your platform and verify its
SHA-256 checksum before installing. To install a specific release, set
`FORGE_VERSION`, for example `v0.1.0-beta.8`.

On Linux the installer also installs the sandbox's dependencies —
`bubblewrap` and `socat` — if they are not already present, prompting once
for `sudo`. It supports apt, dnf, yum, pacman, zypper, and apk. If that fails
it says so and continues: forge still runs, but without a sandbox it must ask
before every command. Set `FORGE_SKIP_DEPS=1` to manage them yourself.

macOS needs nothing extra; its sandbox is built into the OS.

Windows runs forge under WSL2, where it uses the Linux sandbox. There is no
native Windows build — the PowerShell installer detects WSL2 and points you
at the Linux installer inside it. The sandbox suite runs against WSL2 in CI.

### Build from source

You need Git and Rust 1.97.1 or newer.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NorviaLabs/forge.git
cd forge
cargo build --release --locked --package forge-cli
./target/release/forge --version
```

To run the development build:

```sh
cargo run --locked --package forge-cli
```

## Start Forge

Run Forge from the repository you want the agent to work in:

```sh
forge
```

The default workspace is the current directory. Forge also respects the
`FORGE_WORKSPACE` environment variable.

On first launch, Forge walks through theme, directory trust, and provider
connect. A committed theme is stored in your user config; trust is stored
per directory (children inherit). Esc during those steps quits without
claiming setup is done. Later folders only ask for trust. Returning to a
trusted folder opens the normal TUI.

### Automation and benchmark runs

Forge also has a frontend-independent entry point for automation. Pipe one
prompt to `forge bench` to use the same session assembly, provider routes,
credentials, journal, sandbox, governance, and tool loop as the TUI:

```sh
printf '%s\n' 'Inspect the repository and summarize it.' | \
  forge bench \
    --workspace /path/to/repository \
    --journal /tmp/forge-journal \
    --model openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna \
    --route-id openai-chatgpt \
    --effort max \
    --approve-all
```

The command emits one JSON response on stdout and keeps logs on stderr.
`--approve-all` is intended only for an isolated evaluation checkout; without
it, a tool request that needs human approval stops with an error.

## Providers and models

Forge includes native routes for:

- OpenAI API (`openai/*`)
- Anthropic API (`anthropic/*`)
- xAI Grok through OAuth (`xai/*`)
- OpenAI Codex subscriptions through device login (`openai-codex/*`)
- OpenCode Go (`opencode-go/*`)
- OpenCode Zen (`opencode-zen/*`)
- Ollama running locally (`ollama/*`)

The simplest setup is to export a provider key and model, then launch Forge:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
export FORGE_MODEL_ID="openai/gpt-4.1-mini"
forge
```

Other API-key environment variables include `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`OPENCODE_API_KEY`, `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY`, and `OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY`.

For OAuth providers, use `/connect` inside Forge. For Ollama, start the local
Ollama service first, then choose the Ollama route and a locally available
model.

Useful in-app commands:

```text
/connect       Connect or change a provider
/model         Browse or change models
/resume        Browse previous sessions in the current journal
/continue     Resume the most recent previous session
/fork         Start a new session from this conversation
/clear         Clear the visible transcript
/compact       Compact the active context
/disconnect    Remove a saved provider connection
/refresh       Refresh the file explorer's Git state
/edit          Open the active file in your editor
/context-file  Attach the active file to the next message
/terminal      Open the terminal panel
/theme         Change the presentation theme
/status        Session status and diagnostics
/effort        Set model effort
/thinking      Toggle model thinking generation
/help          Open help
/quit          Close the current session (exit when it is the last one)
```

`/resume <session-id>` resumes a specific session. The command-line form
`forge --resume <session-id>` does the same; bare `forge --resume` resumes the
most recently modified session when one exists.

## Keyboard controls

Forge displays contextual hints for the current focus. The most useful global
controls are:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Move between visible blocks |
| `Enter` / `i` | Interact with the focused block or control |
| `Esc` | Leave the current interaction level |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate a local list or input |
| `F1` | Open help |
| `F3` | Open the session switcher |
| `F4` | Open model picker |
| `Ctrl+E` | Toggle the Files explorer |
| `Ctrl+Backtick` | Toggle the terminal panel (or `/terminal`) |
| `Ctrl+O` | Expand or collapse tool details |
| `Alt+M` | Quick-switch model |
| `Alt+,` / `Alt+.` | Step reasoning effort down or up |
| `Alt+←` | Go back to the previous workspace view |
| `Ctrl+↑` / `Ctrl+↓` | Move the selection in the queued-message list |
| `Ctrl+Backspace` | Cancel the selected queued message |
| `Ctrl+C` | Interrupt the running turn, or quit when idle |
| `Ctrl+D` | Quit |
| `Ctrl+Shift+V` | Attach a screenshot from the local OS clipboard |

The footer carries a chip row: model and effort. It is an ordinary `Tab`
stop — `Tab` to it, `←`/`→` to pick a chip, `Enter` to open the picker.
`Enter` still sends from the composer; `⏎` is a hint only. `Ctrl+Shift+V` attaches a
PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP from the local clipboard (workspace-only; SSH has no image
clipboard). Model, effort, thinking, and provider connection controls remain
available while a turn is running; changes apply to the next model step. The model can also call
`view_image` on a workspace file when the active model accepts image input.

The Files explorer needs a terminal at least 116 columns wide. Below that
`Ctrl+E` says so rather than toggling a pane that cannot be drawn.

When the terminal panel is focused, it is an interactive login shell, and its
title shows a `●` with a thicker rule so you can tell it holds the keyboard.
Type or paste commands directly into it; standard control keys, arrows, Tab,
and terminal resize are forwarded to the shell. `Ctrl+Backtick`, `Esc`, or a
submitted `exit` closes the panel without killing the shell, so reopening
resumes the same session.

When a text file is open, the workspace uses Vim-style editing. Files start in
Normal mode; press `i` to insert, `Esc` to return to Normal mode, and `Alt+E`
to hand the file to `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR`. In Normal mode, `:` opens the editor
command line. The beta command set includes `:w`, `:q`, `:q!`, `:wq`, `:x`,
`:e [path]`, `:s/pattern/replacement/[g]`, and `:%s/pattern/replacement/[g]`.
Saving is immediate. Forge asks whether to save, discard, or cancel before
leaving or switching away from dirty buffers, and asks whether to reload or
force-save when the file changed on disk. Binary and invalid-UTF-8 files stay
explicitly read-only.

## Configuration

Forge reads defaults, a user configuration file, a `forge.toml` in the
working directory, and environment variables. Environment variables override
file configuration.

A minimal project `forge.toml` can look like this:

```toml
[model]
model = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini"

[tui]
theme = "forge-dark"
file_icons = "unicode"

[journal]
path = ".forge/sessions"

[tools.agents]
max_depth = 2
min_wait_ms = 100
default_wait_ms = 10000
max_wait_ms = 120000
```

Agent orchestration is enabled by default. The model can use `spawn_agent`,
`send_message`, `followup_task`, `wait_agent`, `list_agents`, and
`interrupt_agent`. Each child runs in an isolated Git worktree and inherits the
parent model, governance, and workspace policy. `spawn_agent` can narrow a
child's tools with `tool_allowlist`.

`max_depth` bounds nested work. `send_message` queues a
mailbox message without waking its target; `followup_task` wakes an idle or
completed descendant. Agent IDs are opaque session identifiers, and operations
are limited to descendants of the calling agent. Child journals, statuses,
summaries, and worktree locations are durable. Running children are resumed
after a restart when their worktree is recoverable; completed children remain
available for a later follow-up without reopening their historical task.

### Themes

Forge ships built-in themes you can pick with `/theme` or set in `forge.toml`.
Bare `/theme` opens a bottom dock: ↑↓ live-previews against the real UI, Enter
confirms, Esc restores the previous theme. `/theme <id>` applies immediately.

| Theme id | Name |
| --- | --- |
| `forge-dark` | Forge Dark (default) |
| `forge-light` | Forge Light |
| `system` | Follow terminal light/dark preference |

Drop custom `.toml` theme files into `.forge/themes/` in your workspace or
`~/.config/forge/themes/` to add or override themes. See
`crates/forge-tui/themes/` for the schema and examples.

Common environment variables are:

```text
FORGE_MODEL_ID
FORGE_MODEL_PROVIDER
FORGE_API_KEY
FORGE_WORKSPACE
FORGE_JOURNAL_PATH
FORGE_MODEL_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS
```

Forge stores session journals in repository-local runtime storage when
possible, or in the platform application-data directory outside a Git
repository. Runtime data is not source code and should not be committed.

### MCP servers

MCP servers can be configured in a trusted user config or an explicitly
managed configuration:

```toml
[[mcp.servers]]
id = "my-tools"
transport = "stdio"
command = "my-mcp-server"
args = ["--stdio"]
```

Project-discovered configuration is intentionally restricted: settings that
could execute code or redirect credentialed requests are not accepted from an
untrusted checked-out repository.

### The sandbox

Every shell command the agent runs is confined by the operating system.
Confinement is applied at spawn, so it does not depend
on the agent classifying a command correctly beforehand — forge does not try
to decide whether `rm -rf` is dangerous, it removes the reach that would make
it matter.

| Platform | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`), built into the OS |
| Linux | bubblewrap (`bwrap`) |
| Windows | WSL2, using the Linux sandbox |

Inside the sandbox a command can:

- **read** inside your workspace, the per-session temp directory, and the
  OS-owned paths a process needs to start (system binaries, libraries,
  frameworks, and standard configuration), plus the read-only runtime paths
  selected from the command's resolved executable and configured toolchain
  homes. Everything else user-writable — `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, and other home
  configuration included — is outside that boundary, exactly as it is for
  `read_file`/`write_file`;
- **write** only inside your workspace and the per-session temp directory;
- **use** installed command-line tools without exposing host caches or
  credentials: Cargo's mutable state is redirected into the per-session temp
  directory, and XDG-aware clients get session-local config, cache, and state
  directories;
- **reach the network** only through the egress proxy described below;
- **hand a file to a host app** with macOS `open` (Launch Services). That app
  is not confined. The same Apple Event right also lets a command drive other
  GUI apps via `osascript`.

`.git` and `.forge` are read-only: the agent can inspect history but cannot
rewrite it, and cannot edit the permission rules that govern it.

What a command needs from outside that boundary — an SSH key, an installed SDK,
or unrelated home data — is refused by the OS and escalated to you: forge asks
before replaying the command unconfined rather than letting a confined process
reach it. Selected command runtimes remain read-only; their network access
still requires an explicit personal `host(...)` grant, and `.git` remains
read-only unless the command is an explicitly approved git operation.

Forge reports a shell-redirection refusal even when a later pipeline stage
makes the shell exit zero. Network refusals are attributed to the exact command
that reached the proxy, so a swallowed error cannot trigger a misleading
approval on the next command. A command that deliberately discards every
filesystem diagnostic and returns zero is not observable from the portable
process interface; the write is still blocked, but Forge cannot infer that an
unconfined retry was intended.

If macOS `open` reports the Launch Services permission error `-54`, Forge
asks to retry that exact command outside the sandbox. For a failed `bash`
call whose output does not identify a sandbox denial, the agent can use
`request_unconfined_retry` with the failed call's ID and a reason. Forge
recovers the original arguments and asks for one-time approval; the request
cannot supply a replacement command. Session and saved command rules do not
authorize removal of the sandbox. A failed unconfined attempt cannot trigger
another escalation for the same command during that turn. Retry references
are consumed once and expire at the end of the turn. After restarting Forge,
an approval whose original arguments are unavailable must be denied and the
command issued again; Forge never executes redacted display arguments as a
sandbox retry.

There is one residual socket gap worth stating plainly. On Linux the sandbox
still exposes the rest of the host filesystem read-only rather than hiding
it, and a read-only *mount* does not stop a process connecting to a Unix
socket — that check looks at the inode, not the mount flag. Forge masks
`/run`, `/tmp`, and the home trees (`/home`, `/root`), which covers the
sockets with the worst blast radius: `docker.sock` (root on the host),
systemd, D-Bus, `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (where ssh-agent and gpg-agent live), and
`~/.docker`. A pathname socket somewhere else — under `/var` or `/opt` — is
still reachable from inside the sandbox. A confined command already runs as
you, so this widens what it can touch rather than crossing a privilege
boundary. Closing it needs Landlock's `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX`,
which is newer than the kernels forge runs on today; seccomp cannot express
it. Tracked in issue #392.

If the OS cannot confine — bubblewrap missing, an unsupported platform — forge
does not start. It prints why on stderr and exits. There is no combination of
settings that turns oversight off without an enforcement floor in place.

### Network egress

The sandbox denies network access outright, then reinstates it through a
filtering proxy reached over a Unix socket. The proxy reads the `CONNECT` host
each request names and refuses anything not on the allow-list. It does not
terminate TLS, install a certificate, or see your traffic — it only decides
where a connection may go.

The allow-list is empty until you add hosts. Nothing — not crates.io, npm,
PyPI, or GitHub — is reachable unless a personal `host(...)` allow says so,
or you grant unrestricted network with `host(*)`. A repo-committed file
cannot open this; only your personal permissions file can.

### Permission rules

`permissions.toml` can re-prompt a call (`deny`) or skip a prompt that would
otherwise appear (`allow`). Pattern rules match the actual call — a command
prefix for shell tools, a path glob for file tools, a host for fetch-style
tools. `host(...)` rules are different: they feed the egress proxy, not the
approval prompt. Shell does not prompt by default, so `allow` rules for shell
do nothing to prompting. MCP still prompts unless allowed:

```toml
allow = [
  "bash(cargo test *)",
  "bash(cargo build*)",
  "host(**.crates.io)",
  "host(**.github.com)",
]
deny = ["bash(cargo publish*)"]
```

`host(*)` is unrestricted network through the proxy (the filesystem sandbox
stays on). A `host(...)` deny still wins over a broader allow.

A `deny` entry carves an exception out of a broader `allow` entry (`cargo *`
allowed, but `cargo publish` still asks); it never blocks a call outright —
that's still the ACL's job. Two files are read and merged:

- `<user config dir>/forge/permissions.toml` — personal, trusted.
- `.forge/permissions.toml` in the workspace — repo-committed, and for the
  same reason project-discovered MCP config is restricted above, its `allow`
  entries are ignored. A checked-out repository cannot grant itself a wider
  blast radius than a human approved locally. Its `deny` entries are always
  honored, since narrowing approval further is safe regardless of source.

Menu rows (when a prompt appears):

- **Run once** — run this call; ask again next time.
- **Remember similar commands this session** — remember a generalized
  family for the rest of the session. The selected row explains what would
  match (for example `git push …`). Matching commands later run without a
  prompt; a different family still asks. Not written to `permissions.toml`.
- **Don't run** — block the call.

When the sandbox blocked a host (for example a CLI talking to
`api.github.com`), the menu is a host grant instead, and the command is
retried still confined. A host grant also **projects HTTPS identity**
for that host into the confined spawn: credentials are filled on the
host (`git credential`), SSH remotes (`git@host:`) are rewritten to
HTTPS (SSH cannot use the CONNECT proxy), git-dir writes are allowed
only for spawns that run `git` itself — and never for `.git/hooks`,
which would otherwise run on the host — and HTTPS CLIs
that read a `{label}_TOKEN`
environment variable receive one derived from the granted host. Ordinary
commands still cannot write `.git`. The sandbox cannot open the OS
secret store, so without projection an HTTPS client prints HTTP 401 /
"invalid token" and looks like broken auth.

- **Always allow `**.github.com`** — writes `host(**.github.com)` to the
  personal permissions file so the next session does not ask again.
- **Allow `**.github.com` this session** — live proxy only.
- **Don't run** — block the call.

### Approvals

There is no permission-mode setting. Shell commands and file writes run
without a prompt: the sandbox is the boundary. MCP tools still prompt,
because those are separate server processes the sandbox does not confine. A
`deny` pattern re-prompts even for shell. An ACL deny is a hard block, not a
prompt.

A host that cannot confine never reaches this policy — Forge refuses to start.

### Approving shell commands

When a command needs approval, use the inline menu:

- **↑ / ↓** — move selection (default: Run once)
- **Enter** — confirm
- **Esc** — don’t run (or back out of “Deny with note”)

Optional text aliases still work: `yes`, `no`, `remember`, `always`,
`no <note>`.

## Built-in tools

Depending on configuration, the agent can use tools for:

- reading and writing files;
- applying validated workspace-confined patches;
- running shell commands inside the sandbox;
- inspecting Git status and diffs;
- fast file and content search;
- coordinating isolated child agents and reviewing their status;
- web search;
- configured MCP tools.

Tool arguments are validated before execution, and shell commands are confined
by the OS sandbox rather than judged for danger beforehand. Forge does not
treat model output as trusted input.

## Sessions and resume

Forge supports multiple durable managed sessions inside one TUI. Each session
has its own identifier, transcript, queued follow-ups, model selection, runtime
state, and isolated linked Git worktree. A session can continue streaming or
running tools in the background while you switch to another session and work
there independently.

Use `F3` to open the session switcher. Session presentation and input routing
stay session-local: switching sessions does not move drafts, queued prompts,
approvals, questions, or model state into another session.

If Forge stops unexpectedly, start it with:

```sh
forge --continue
```

`--continue` resumes the most recently modified previous session in the
current workspace. To browse or resume a specific session:

```sh
forge --resume
forge --resume <session-id>
```

Use `--fork <session-id>` to create a new session seeded with the selected
conversation while leaving the original session unchanged. The equivalent TUI
commands are `/continue`, `/resume`, and `/fork`. Model transcripts are
session-scoped; composer Up/Down recall is stored separately at the user level
and partitioned by workspace, so starting a new session does not erase recent
input recall. `/clear` hides the rendered transcript but does not erase model
context; use `/compact` when you want a smaller model-visible context.

Inside the TUI, `/resume` lists previous sessions and shows a title hint from
the first user message when available. Session journals stay separate from your
source files and should never contain API keys or OAuth tokens.

## Safety

Forge can execute commands and modify files on your machine. Treat it like a
shell with an AI interface:

1. Run it only in repositories you trust. The sandbox confines what a command
   can reach; it does not make an untrusted repository safe to build.
2. Read each approval prompt, including the exact command and consequence.
   In Auto mode most shell commands do not prompt — the sandbox is what
   stands in for that review, so check that it is active (the footer's mode
   chip says when the mode is capped).
3. Keep credentials in your environment or trusted user configuration. The
   sandbox restricts where a command may connect, but a command that legitimately
   reaches an allow-listed host can carry whatever it can read.
4. Do not commit `.forge/`, runtime journals, API keys, OAuth tokens, or
   credential files.
5. Use a disposable clone when evaluating an unfamiliar repository.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model and private vulnerability
reporting process.

## Development

Forge is a Rust workspace. The main crates are:
