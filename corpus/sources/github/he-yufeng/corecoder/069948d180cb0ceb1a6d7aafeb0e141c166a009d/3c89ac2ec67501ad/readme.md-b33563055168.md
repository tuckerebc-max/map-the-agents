- **Readable end to end.** Read the whole engine in an afternoon, with no magic hidden anywhere you can't follow it.
- **Hackable.** Set a breakpoint on any line, change it, rerun, all on your own machine. It genuinely works, which makes this a living reference rather than a diagram.
- **The gaps are the point.** It deliberately keeps only the minimal core; what's missing isn't half-finished, it's where you branch off and make it your own.

## How it compares

| | CoreCoder | Claude Code | aider | nanoGPT |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lines of code | ~1,171 engine / 2,398 total | hundreds of thousands (closed) | tens of thousands of Python | ~600 (two files) |
| Time to read it all | one afternoon | can't (closed) | a few days of slogging | one afternoon |
| Breakpoint, change, rerun? | yes, every line | no | yes, but there's a lot | yes |
| What it's for | understand one, then fork your own | production coding assistant | terminal pair-programming | minimal GPT for teaching |

The nanoGPT column is there as a reference point: minimal, readable, but it teaches you to train a GPT. CoreCoder is after the same thing, only the subject is an agent that actually edits code. Sitting it next to Claude Code and aider isn't about competing for their users. CoreCoder is the foundation you stand on while you learn from them and get going; it isn't in the same race.

## What this is

I've always felt coding agents get talked about as if they were arcane. Strip a tool like Claude Code or Cursor all the way down and the core is a `while` loop wrapped around a large model, plus seven or eight tools that let it actually do things. The hard part was never the loop; it's everything the loop has to cope with once it meets the real world. CoreCoder is the minimal version that writes that core out honestly.

The engine (loop, model interface, context, tools, sessions) is 1,171 lines once you drop blank lines and comments. Counting the outer CLI, config and packaging too, the whole package is 24 files: 2,398 physical lines, 1,941 net, every one short enough to read in a single sitting. The growth since the original 1,161-line snapshot went into visible features: plan mode, hooks and checkpoints, each documented below.

And it really runs: reads and writes files, executes shell, spawns sub-agents, compacts context in three tiers, and tells you the tokens and dollars a run burned whenever you ask. Anything that would mutate your disk or run a command stops for your consent first. 157 tests, all green. But the point of it running isn't to become your daily driver. It runs so the walkthrough can't lie: a reference that shows how an agent works has to actually work.

The code came out of a public teardown: open analyses have already exposed a lot of the load-bearing architecture inside production agents like Claude Code. I took the most essential layer and rewrote it honestly, in as little code as I could. So reading CoreCoder is roughly like reading a runnable, annotated take on how that kind of agent works, except it's only a minimal reimplementation, sitting right there on your machine for you to take apart and change.

</p>

<p align="center"><sub><i>These thousand lines really do run a full loop end to end: ask it to fix buggy.py and it reads the file, edits the code, runs it once to confirm, then reports back on its own. Watch it, then come back and read the code.</i></sub></p>

This README follows the same arc: the first half helps you **read it** (the code map, the main loop, eight essays), the second half helps you **fork it** and points at a few directions worth pushing further.

## Run it once first (five minutes before you read)

Before you read the source, get it running on your machine once to build some intuition. It's a foundation meant for forking, so the recommended path is to clone it and install editable, reading and changing as you go:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/he-yufeng/CoreCoder
cd CoreCoder
pip install -e .
```

If you just want to get it running first, `pip install corecoder` works too.

Give it a model and a key and it goes. It speaks the OpenAI-compatible API by default, and switching providers is usually just two environment variables:

| Provider | Example env vars |
|---|---|
| OpenAI (default `gpt-5.5`) | `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` |
| DeepSeek | `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com CORECODER_MODEL=deepseek-chat` |
| OmniRoute | `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:20128/v1 CORECODER_MODEL=auto` |
| Local Ollama | `OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1 CORECODER_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder` |

Kimi, Qwen and the like are the same two variables; for providers that don't even offer an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, the optional LiteLLM backend (`pip install "corecoder[litellm]"`) routes to a hundred-plus of them. The third essay goes into this in detail. The key can be `export`ed directly or dropped into a `.env` at the project root, which is loaded on startup. Then:

Smoke-tested end to end (read the file, edit it, run it, report back) against DeepSeek, Qwen3 and Kimi K2 via a single OpenRouter-compatible endpoint; each completed the full loop. One note for one-shot scripts: `-p` refuses mutating tools unless you pass `--yes`, by design.

```bash
corecoder                                             # interactive REPL
corecoder -p "add error handling to parse_config()"   # one-shot mode, exits when done
```

## Read it: the code map

Laid out flat, the whole project is this big. Skim it before you clone and you'll know where everything is. This is the most concrete difference from Claude Code's hundreds of thousands of lines: you can read it like the table of contents of a book. Start from the main loop in `agent.py`; that's the heart of the whole agent.

Eight tools: `bash`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `glob`, `grep`, `todo_write` (a task checklist the agent maintains for itself), and `agent` (which spawns a sub-agent). Everything else is the CLI shell, config, and packaging wrapped around that engine core. If `~/.corecoder/mcp.json` exists, its MCP servers join the eight as extra `mcp__*` tools; the MCP section below covers it.

## A `while` loop is the whole agent

The whole of an agent fits in one sentence: hand the user's words to the model, run whatever tools it asks for, stuff the results back into the context, ask again, and keep going until it stops asking for tools and gives an answer. In code, that's about a dozen lines:

```python
# corecoder/agent.py · the main loop (trimmed skeleton)
def chat(self, user_input):
    self.messages.append(user_input)

    for _ in range(self.max_rounds):                   # bounded, so it can't run away
        reply = self.llm.chat(self.messages, self.tools)   # ask the model what to do next
        if not reply.tool_calls:                       # model wants no more tools
            return reply.text                          #   -> done, hand the answer back
        results = run_parallel(reply.tool_calls)       # tools requested -> run in parallel
        self.messages += results                       # feed results back, loop again

    return "(hit the round limit)"
```

That's the whole thing. The core skeleton is about twenty lines; counting parallel execution and the bookkeeping after a Ctrl+C interrupt, maybe forty. Almost everything else in CoreCoder's thousand-odd lines is there to clean up the mess the loop runs into once it meets the real world. `llm.py` ends up the biggest file in the project, not because calling a model is hard, but because a streamed response splinters each tool call's arguments into fragments you have to restitch in order, a provider will hand you half a JSON object or a null `usage` field, and 429s, timeouts, dropped connections and 5xx all need backoff-and-retry while the other 4xx should just raise. That unglamorous grunt work, not the loop, is where the real engineering of taking an agent from demo to delivery actually lives; the third essay follows it down to the line.

Three decisions are worth a closer look, because they're the kind of call you can only make after you've understood how others did it, and they're judgments you can lift straight into your own fork.

**`edit_file` does search-and-replace on a unique match, not line numbers.** Line numbers are a trap: the model only has to miscount by one and it quietly edits the wrong place. Anchor on a unique snippet of the original instead. If there's no match, it hands the start of the file back so the model can re-anchor; if there are several matches, it makes the model bring more surrounding context rather than gamble on one. On a successful edit it returns a diff. Recoverable on failure, verifiable on success: the whole loop stays inside the tool.

**Context isn't cut all at once when it's full; it gives ground in three tiers, cheapest first.** At half full (50%) it trims over-long tool outputs in place, a tier that's purely mechanical and costs no model call. If 70% still isn't enough, it has the model summarize the older turns into a single paragraph while keeping the most recent ones verbatim. Only at 90% does it hit the emergency tier and pull everything, summary and recent turns alike, down to its tightest form. Blunt truncation tends to throw away exactly the early decision a long task leans on most; tiering lets it surrender the least important things first instead of lopping off the oldest decisions wholesale from the start.

**You constrain a sub-agent by withholding the tool, not by writing rules and hoping it obeys.** A spawned sub-agent gets an isolated context and its own separate history, with a toolset exactly one item shorter than the parent's: the `agent` tool itself, so it can't recursively spawn more sub-agents. Handing it one fewer tool is cleaner than legislating a rule after the fact. It also reuses the parent's model connection (its spend folded into the same running total), truncates its output once it runs past 5,000 characters down to just the opening, and runs on a shorter round limit than the parent. The same restraint, end to end.

Every one of these *whys* is traced down to the actual lines of code in the series below.

## The source-reading series · 8 bilingual essays

I also wrote a bilingual source-reading series, one intro plus seven parts, each in Chinese with an English mirror. Against CoreCoder's actual code, it walks through how agents like Claude Code work under the hood. One hard rule I set myself: every line count and every snippet is re-read and re-checked from the repo, never written from memory. The first six get you reading, the seventh gets you forking; read them in any order.

- **[Intro · Read Claude Code through CoreCoder, then build your own](article/00-index_EN.md)**
- **[01 · An agent, at its core, is a `while` loop](article/01-the-loop_EN.md)** — the main loop in `agent.py`, interrupts, and the round limit
- **[02 · The tool system: letting the model act, safely](article/02-tools_EN.md)** — the seven tools in `tools/` and the bash safety gate
- **[03 · Plug in any LLM, and keep the bill honest](article/03-llm-and-cost_EN.md)** — `llm.py`'s provider wrapper, retries, and cost accounting
- **[04 · Surviving a long task on a finite window](article/04-context_EN.md)** — `context.py`'s three-tier compaction and orphaned tool messages
- **[05 · Parallel execution and sub-agents](article/05-parallel-and-subagents_EN.md)** — thread-pool concurrency and sub-agent isolation
- **[06 · Turning it into a real command-line tool](article/06-session-and-cli_EN.md)** — `session.py` and path-traversal defense
- **[07 · Fork CoreCoder into your own coding agent](article/07-build-your-own_EN.md)** — from fork to custom tools to swapping models

## Fork it, build something better

Once you understand it, the natural next step is to fork. Getting started doesn't take much:

- **Swap in a model you actually use.** It's the two env vars from above; `llm.py` (267 lines) is the entry point for all provider adaptation.
- **Add a tool of your own.** Write a new file against the tool base class in `tools/base.py` (27 lines): run tests, fetch a page, call an LSP, whatever. The end of the second essay walks you through your first one by hand.
- **Rewrite the system prompt.** `prompt.py` is all of 41 lines; change one line and you'll watch the agent's temperament shift. It's the cheapest "change one thing, see a result" in the whole project.
- **Import it as a library.** The top level exports `Agent`, `LLM`, and `Config`, ready to embed in your own program:

```python
from corecoder import Agent, LLM

llm = LLM(model="deepseek-chat", api_key="sk-...", base_url="https://api.deepseek.com")
print(Agent(llm=llm).chat("find every TODO comment in this project and list them"))
```

Going deeper, the directions are out in the open too. None of the following is in CoreCoder, by design, not because it's unfinished. Flip it around and each one is an entry point you can carry into a real tool of your own:

- **The dangerous-command blocking in bash is just a regex blacklist.** It guards against slips, not a security sandbox. Facing untrusted input means reaching for seccomp or container isolation. This is the hardest of the four; it goes all the way down to the syscall and isolation layer.
- **Retry is only exponential backoff.** No fallback model, no hard dollar budget. Follow `llm.py` down and add a fallback model chain plus a stop-on-over-budget gate; the change stays mostly inside that one file.
- **Sub-agents only run the plainest synchronous execution.** Make it async or a streaming executor and you close the exact gap the fifth essay identifies between this and how production agents stream execution.
- **No RAG, and the MCP client speaks tools only.** Retrieval-based code location for big repos is still open, and `mcp.py` leaves resources and prompts unimplemented on purpose. Either one is a real way to grow from a minimal core into your own stronger agent.

The README only points; the seventh essay picks up the code details for each. Pick one and start; that's the whole reason the core is kept this small.

## Commands

Inside the REPL, `/help` lists everything; these are the ones you'll reach for:

```
/model <name>    switch model
/compact         compact the context by hand
/tokens          token usage and cost estimate
/diff            files changed this session
/undo            revert the most recent file change
/plan            toggle plan mode (read-only, then a plan to approve)
/save  /sessions save / list sessions
quit / exit      exit (Ctrl+C cancels the current round)
```

Session IDs are sanitized to safe characters before they become filenames, every archive lands under `~/.corecoder/sessions`, and a malicious session name can't traverse out.

## Permissions

Read-only tools (`read_file`, `glob`, `grep`, `todo_write`) run the moment the model asks. The mutating ones (`edit_file`, `write_file`, `bash`, and spawning a sub-agent) stop for consent first, and the REPL banner shows which mode you're in:

- In the REPL you get one prompt per call: allow once, always allow this tool, or deny. "Always" is remembered per tool for the rest of the session, and a sub-agent inherits the same layer, so consent follows the work wherever it happens.
- In one-shot mode (`-p`) there is nobody to ask, so a mutating call is refused on the spot and the refusal goes back to the model as an ordinary tool result: the loop never hangs on input that can't arrive. Pass `--yes` to approve everything up front (scripts, CI).
- The decision itself is pure logic in `permissions.py`, with the terminal only supplying the prompt callback. You can unit-test consent without a TTY, or reuse the layer in your own embedding.

## Plan mode

`/plan` toggles plan mode in the REPL. While it's on, the prompt shows `(plan)` and every mutating call (writes, edits, bash, MCP tools, sub-agents) is refused on the spot: the refusal goes back to the model as an ordinary tool result, telling it to keep investigating read-only and present a numbered plan instead. When the plan looks right, `approve` (or `/plan` again) hands control back and the agent executes. Mechanically it is one flag on the `Agent` plus one refusal branch ahead of the consent gate, which itself stays untouched; there is no plan file and nothing is remembered between sessions.

## Hooks

Drop a `hooks.json` under `~/.corecoder` and your own shell commands run around every tool call, the same idea as Claude Code's hooks:

```json
{
  "PreToolUse":  [{"matcher": "bash", "command": "cat >> ~/.corecoder/audit.jsonl"}],
  "PostToolUse": [{"matcher": "*",    "command": "cat >> ~/.corecoder/trace.jsonl"}]
}
```

Each hook gets the call as JSON on stdin (`tool_name`, `tool_input`; post hooks also get `tool_response`). The matcher is an exact tool name; empty or `*` fires on every tool. A pre hook can veto the call with exit code 2, and its stderr travels back to the model as the reason so it can route around the block. Post hooks only observe and can never block. A hook that errors or runs past ten seconds is skipped with a warning: hooks assist the loop, they never get to kill it. The whole mechanism is `hooks.py`, and the REPL banner shows how many hooks loaded.

Two worth stealing (the commands lean on `jq`, the usual suspect):

```bash
# 1. lint gate: after every edit/write, run the project's fast linter on the
#    touched file. The model sees the output and fixes its own mistakes in
#    the same turn instead of waiting for CI.
{
  "PostToolUse": [{
    "matcher": "edit",
    "command": "f=$(jq -r .tool_input.path); ruff check \"$f\" 2>&1 | head -20"
  }]
}

# 2. write protect: refuse edits under paths you never want an agent to
#    touch. Exit code 2 vetoes the call and the message reaches the model.
{
  "PreToolUse": [{
    "matcher": "edit",
    "command": "case \"$(jq -r .tool_input.path)\" in .env*|*/secrets/*|*.pem) echo 'that path is off-limits' >&2; exit 2;; esac"
  }]
}
```

Both are plain shell; nothing here is CoreCoder-specific syntax beyond the JSON shape and the exit-code-2 veto.

## MCP servers

Drop a `mcp.json` under `~/.corecoder` and tools from any MCP server join the agent over stdio, the same config shape as Claude Code's:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"]}
  }
}
```

Each configured server starts as a subprocess at launch, handshakes, and lists its tools; every one is registered as `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, so hook matchers and the consent gate treat it exactly like a built-in. MCP tools stay out of the read-only set, meaning the agent asks before running one. The handshake gets fifteen seconds, a call gets sixty, and a server that dies or never answers fails that one call as an ordinary tool result instead of killing the loop. The client speaks the tools slice of the protocol (initialize, tools/list, tools/call) and nothing else, which keeps the whole thing inside `mcp.py` at about 200 lines. With no `mcp.json` there is no MCP and nothing changes.
